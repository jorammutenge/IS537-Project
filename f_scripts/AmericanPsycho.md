building...<br><br>35<br>00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,686<br>on West 81st Street<br>on the 11th floor.<br><br>36<br>00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,897<br>My name is Patrick Bateman.<br><br>37<br>00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,899<br>I'm 27 years old.<br><br>38<br>00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:20,236<br>I believe in<br>taking care of myself,<br><br>39<br>00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:25,241<br>in a balanced diet,<br>in a rigorous exercise routine.<br><br>40<br>00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:27,743<br>In the morning,<br>if my face is a little puffy,<br><br>41<br>00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,913<br>I'll put on an ice pack<br>while doing my stomach crunches.<br><br>42<br>00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,915<br>I can do a thousand now.<br><br>43<br>00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:54,437<br>After I remove the ice pack,<br>I use a deep pore<br>cleanser lotion.<br><br>44<br>00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,773<br>In the shower, I use<br>a water-activated gel cleanser.<br><br>45<br>00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,445<br>Then<br>a honey-almond body scrub.<br><br>46<br>00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,240<br>And on the face,<br>an exfoliating gel scrub.<br><br>47<br>00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,294<br>Then I apply<br>an herb mint facial masque,<br><br>48<br>00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,423<br>which I leave on for ten minutes<br>while I prepare the rest<br>of my routine.<br><br>49<br>00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,971<br>I always use<br>an aftershave lotion<br>with little or no alcohol,<br><br>50<br>00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,850<br>because alcohol<br>dries your face out<br>and makes you look older.<br><br>51<br>00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,852<br>Then moisturizer,<br><br>52<br>00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:36,938<br>then an anti-aging eye balm,<br><br>53<br>00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,483<br>followed by a final<br>moisturizing protective lotion.<br><br>54<br>00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,154<br>There is an idea<br>of a Patrick Bateman.<br><br>55<br>00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:49,367<br>Some kind of abstraction,<br>but there is no real me.<br><br>56<br>00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,328<br>Only an entity...<br>something illusory.<br><br>57<br>00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,997<br>And though I can hide<br>my cold gaze...<br><br>58<br>00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,251<br>and you can shake my hand<br>and feel flesh<br>gripping yours...<br><br>59<br>00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:03,130<br>and maybe you can even sense<br>our lifestyles<br>are probably comparable,<br><br>60<br>00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,509<br>I simply am not there.<br><br>61<br>00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,409<br>Good morning.<br><br>62<br>00:07:31,576 -->

Sports<br>came out in '83,<br><br>357<br>00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,088<br>I think they really<br>came into their own,<br>commercially and artistically.<br><br>358<br>00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:17,011<br>The whole album has<br>a clear, crisp sound,<br><br>359<br>00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,805<br>and a new sheen of<br>consummate professionalism...<br><br>360<br>00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,100<br>that really gives the songs<br>a big boost.<br><br>361<br>00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,820<br>He's been compared<br>to Elvis Costello,<br><br>362<br>00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:39,534<br>but I think Huey has<br>a far more bitter,<br>cynical sense of humor.<br><br>363<br>00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,494<br>Hey, Halberstram?<br>Yes, Allen?<br><br>364<br>00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:44,413<br>Why are

Square."<br><br>371<br>00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,935<br>The song's so catchy,<br>most people probably<br>don't listen to the lyrics.<br><br>372<br>00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,479<br>But they should,<br>because it's not just about...<br><br>373<br>00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,440<br>the pleasures of conformity<br>and the importance of trends.<br><br>374<br>00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:15,736<br>It's also a personal statement<br>about the band itself.<br>Hey, Paul!<br><br>375<br>00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,287<br>Try getting a reservation<br>at Dorsia

00:30:17,400<br>I use the keys<br>I took from his pocket...<br><br>390<br>00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,485<br>before disposing<br>of the body.<br><br>391<br>00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:22,697<br>There is a moment<br>of sheer panic...<br><br>392<br>00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:27,160<br>when I realize that Paul's<br>apartment overlooks the park...<br><br>393<br>00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,871<br>and is obviously<br>more expensive than mine.<br><br>394<br>00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,877<br>I calm myself<br>and move into the bedroom,<br><br>395<br>00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:39,046<br>where I find his suitcase<br>and start to pack.<br><br>396<br>00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,966<br>It's time for Paul<br>to take a little trip.<br><br>397<br>00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,096<br>Where do I send the

apparent.<br><br>555<br>00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:23,000<br>I think Invisible Touch<br>is the group's<br>undisputed masterpiece.<br><br>556<br>00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:29,465<br>It's an epic meditation<br>on intangibility.<br><br>557<br>00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,263<br>At the same time,<br>it deepens and enriches...<br><br>558<br>00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:38,641<br>the meaning of<br>the preceding three albums.<br><br>559<br>00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,727<br>Christie,<br>take off the robe.<br><br>560<br>00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:45,815<br>Listen to the brilliant<br>ensemble playing...<br><br>561<br>00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:48,568<br>of Banks, Collins<br>and Rutherford.<br><br>562<br>00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:52,989<br>You can practically hear<br>every nuance<br>of every instrument.<br><br>563<br>00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:55,032<br>Sabrina, remove your dress.<br><br>564<br>00:42:56,826 --> 00:43:00,163<br>In terms of<br>lyrical craftsmanship<br>and sheer songwriting,<br><br>565<br>00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:03,332<br>this album hits a new peak<br>of professionalism.<br><br>566<br>00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:05,793<br>Sabrina, why don't you,<br>uh, dance a little.<br><br>567<br>00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:09,839<br>Take the lyrics to<br>"Land of Confusion."<br><br>568<br>00:43:10,047 --> 00:43:12,008<br>In this song,<br>Phil Collins...<br><br>569<br>00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:16,095<br>addresses the problems<br>of abusive political authority.<br><br>570<br>00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,934<br>"In Too Deep"<br>is the most moving pop song<br>of the 1980s...<br><br>571<br>00:43:22,143 --> 00:43:25,354<br>about monogamy and commitment.<br><br>572<br>00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:28,691<br>The song is<br>extremely uplifting.<br><br>573<br>00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:32,153<br>Their lyrics are<br>as positive and affirmative...<br><br>574<br>00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:36,532<br>as, uh, anything<br>I've heard in rock.<br><br>575<br>00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:42,121<br>Christie,<br>get down on your knees...<br><br>576<br>00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:45,249<br>so Sabrina can see your asshole.<br><br>577<br>00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:48,002<br>Phil Collins' solo career...<br><br>578<br>00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:50,880<br>seems to be more commercial,<br><br>579<br>00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,133<br>and therefore more satisfying<br>in a narrower way,<br><br>580<br>00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:58,763<br>especially songs like<br>"In the Air Tonight"<br>and "Against All Odds."<br><br>581<br>00:44:00,848 --> 00:44:02,683<br>Sabrina,<br>don't just stare at it.<br>Eat it.<br><br>582<br>00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:07,772<br>I also think that<br>Phil Collins works best...<br><br>583<br>00:44:07,939 --> 00:44:11,776<br>within the confines<br>of the group<br>than as a solo artist.<br><br>584<br>00:44:11,984 --> 00:44:15,279<br>And I stress the word "artist."<br><br>585<br>00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:21,202<br>This is "Sussudio."<br><br>586<br>00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:24,247<br>A great, great song.<br>A personal favorite.<br><br>587<br>00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:40,763<br>Look at the camera.<br><br>588<br>00:45:14,672 --> 00:45:18,801<br>Christie, look at the camera.<br><br>589<br>00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:36,027<br>Don't touch the watch.<br><br>590<br>00:45:58,257 --> 00:46:00,092<br>Can we go now?<br><br>591<br>00:46:00,259 --> 00:46:02,053<br>We're not through yet.<br><br>592<br>00:46:20,238 --> 00:46:23,533<br>If they have a good personality<br>and they're not great looking,<br>then who fucking cares?<br><br>593<br>00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:25,535<br>Let's just say<br>hypothetically, okay?<br><br>594<br>00:46:25,743 --> 00:46:27,870<br>What if they have<br>a good personality?<br><br>595<br>00:46:28,037 --> 00:46:31,040<br>I know.<br>I know.<br><br>596<br>00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:33,709<br>There are no girls<br>with good personalities.<br><br>597<br>00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:36,629<br>A good personality consists<br>of a chick with<br>a little hard body...<br><br>598<br>00:46:36,754 --> 00:46:38,548<br>who will satisfy<br>all sexual demands...<br><br>599<br>00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:40,550<br>without being too slutty<br>about things...<br><br>600<br>00:46:40,758 --> 00:46:42,552<br>and who will essentially keep<br>her dumb fucking mouth shut.<br><br>601<br>00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,595<br>The only girls<br>with good personalities...<br><br>602<br>00:46:44,762 --> 00:46:47,890<br>who are smart or maybe funny<br>or halfway intelligent<br>or talented...<br><br>603<br>00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:50,893<br>though God knows<br>what the fuck that means...<br>are ugly chicks.<br><br>604<br>00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,229<br>Absolutely.<br>And this is because<br>they have to make up...<br><br>605<br>00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:55,106<br>for how fucking<br>unattractive they are.<br><br>606<br>00:46:55,273 --> 00:46:58,401<br>- Do you know what Ed Gein<br>said about women?<br>- Maitre d' at Canal Bar?<br><br>607<br>00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:02,405<br>- No, serial killer, Wisconsin,<br>in the 50s.<br>- And what did Ed say?<br><br>608<br>00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:05,616<br>"When I see a pretty girl<br>walking down the street,<br>I think two things.<br><br>609<br>00:47:05,783 --> 00:47:08,077<br>"One part of me wants to<br>take her out and talk to her,<br><br>610<br>00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:10,621<br>be real nice and sweet<br>and treat her right."<br><br>611<br>00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,124<br>- And what did the other part<br>of him think?<br><br>612<br>00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:15,793<br>What her head would look like<br>on a stick.<br><br>613<br>00:47:20,631 --> 00:47:23,926<br>Hi, guys.<br>I wanna get your
