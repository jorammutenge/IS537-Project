00:09:00,701<br>- It's always seemed successful.<br>- A ton of clients, I think.<br><br>166<br>00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:03,170<br>- Hedge funds.<br>- I know he'd even turn people away sometimes.<br><br>167<br>00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:05,831<br>- But all the trades...<br>- Yeah, the trades go through European counterparties.<br><br>168<br>00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:07,716<br>That's why he has the London office.<br><br>169<br>00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,926<br>And then upstairs on the<br>19th floor is market making.<br><br>170<br>00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,971<br>- Which is where we work.<br>- These are not my immediate concerns.<br><br>171<br>00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:16,099<br>But if he plans to spend the week...<br><br>172<br>00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:19,353<br>...distributing his ill-gotten gains...<br><br>173<br>00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:21,272<br>...amongst his relatives,<br><br>174<br>00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:23,231<br>...employees, his friends,<br><br>175<br>00:09:23,276 -->

saying?<br>We have to turn him in?<br><br>178<br>00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:33,575<br>You don't turn him in.<br>You're an accomplice.<br><br>179<br>00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:48,798<br>Yeah?<br><br>180<br>00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,802<br>Okay, it's all fine.<br><br>181<br>00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:54,263<br>Yep.<br><br>182<br>00:09:57,976 --> 00:09:59,435<br><i>Who is

00:10:11,029<br>Well, we're here to find out...<br><br>186<br>00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:12,907<br>...if there's an innocent explanation.<br><br>187<br>00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:18,287<br>There is no innocent explanation.<br><br>188<br>00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,249<br>Is there someplace we can talk, privately?<br><br>189<br>00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:24,835<br>In there.<br><br>190<br>00:10:31,009 -->

matter-of-fact about it.</i><br><br>193<br>00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:41,685<br><i>He wasn't nervous,<br>he wasn't afraid.</i><br><br>194<br>00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:43,854<br><i>He was just very casual.</i><br><br>195<br>00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:46,731<br><i>Well, sir, he claims to have acted alone.</i><br><br>196<br>00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,149<br><i>Yes, sir.</i><br><br>197<br>00:10:48,194

stated that you idolized your brother.</i><br><br>222<br>00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:06,767<br><i>- Is that correct?<br>- Yes, and that's correct.</i><br><br>223<br>00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,748<br><i>Why did you idolize your brother?</i><br><br>224<br>00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:12,127<br><i>Well, because he was brilliant.</i><br><br>225<br>00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:14,922<br><i>Everywhere you go,<br>people talked about Bernie.</i><br><br>226<br>00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:16,840<br><i>He was a true pioneer.</i><br><br>227<br>00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,676<br><i>Everyone in the

up.<br><br>253<br>00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:48,098<br>- Weren't there statements?<br>- <i>Every month, they were fake.</i><br><br>254<br>00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:50,643<br>Purchase dates, they were

02:01:48,763<br>It's a combination of feeling numb...<br><br>2438<br>02:01:48,806 --> 02:01:51,264<br>...and it seeming fruitless.<br><br>2439<br>02:01:54,019 --> 02:01:56,562<br>I don't remember how much<br>I got paid as a lifeguard,<br><br>2440<br>02:01:56,606 --> 02:01:59,272<br>...but it was never about the money.<br><br>2441<br>02:02:05,197 --> 02:02:07,156<br><i>In 2013,</i><br><br>2442<br>02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:10,159<br><i>I invited Andrew to speak at a writing seminar</i><br><br>2443<br>02:02:10,202 --> 02:02:12,035<br><i>I conducted at

started chemotherapy...</i><br><br>2446<br>02:02:19,419 --> 02:02:22,254<br><i>...for the reoccurrence of lymphoma.</i><br><br>2447<br>02:02:22,298 --> 02:02:25,508<br><i>The topic I asked him to<br>think about for the class...</i><br><br>2448<br>02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:28,803<br><i>...was how the media had<br>covered his father's case...</i><br><br>2449<br>02:02:28,845 --> 02:02:31,013<br><i>...and how that affected his life.</i><br><br>2450<br>02:02:32,474 --> 02:02:33,973<br><i>I've always wondered,</i><br><br>2451<br>02:02:34,017 --> 02:02:36,184<br>...why didn't you go on TV and state your case?<br><br>2452<br>02:02:36,228 --> 02:02:37,727<br>Why didn't you defend yourself?<br><br>2453<br>02:02:37,772 --> 02:02:39,854<br>Well, one of the reasons<br><br>2454<br>02:02:39,898 --> 02:02:42,691<br>I've always felt<br>uncomfortable...<br><br>2455<br>02:02:42,735 --> 02:02:46,570<br>...about the prospect of<br>going on TV and telling my story...<br><br>2456<br>02:02:46,614 --> 02:02:49,365<br>...is that I don't know if I'm<br>that sympathetic a character.<br><br>2457<br>02:02:49,407 --> 02:02:51,951<br><i>And at the end of the day,</i><br><br>2458<br>02:02:51,994 --> 02:02:55,537<br>I lived a life of great<br>wealth and privilege.<br><br>2459<br>02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:58,374<br>I traveled the world.<br><br>2460<br>02:02:58,416 --> 02:03:00,459<br>I wanted for nothing.<br><br>2461<br>02:03:00,503 --> 02:03:02,585<br><i>All of that was subsidized...</i><br><br>2462<br>02:03:02,629 -->

mother's, myself...<br><br>2465<br>02:03:12,973 --> 02:03:17,142<br>...when there are so many other stories.<br><br>2466<br>02:03:17,186 --> 02:03:19,436<br><i>My brother killed

psychologist...<br><br>2502<br>02:06:35,509 --> 02:06:37,509<br>...who worked on the Ted Bundy case.<br><br>2503<br>02:06:37,553 --> 02:06:39,053<br>And this guy, Joe Blow,<br><br>2504<br>02:06:39,079

myself.<br><br>2508<br>02:06:47,479 --> 02:06:51,982<br>Ah, I can see how that comparison<br>would be troubling, but...<br><br>2509<br>02:06:52,026 --> 02:06:53,400<br>Well, there is no comparison.<br><br>2510<br>02:06:53,443 --> 02:06:55,276<br>I mean, how can you compare me to someone...<br><br>2511<br>02:06:55,321 --> 02:06:57,780<br>...who decapitated women and<br>kept their heads as mementos?<br><br>2512<br>02:06:57,822 --> 02:07:00,991<br>I mean, that's the behavior of a<br>truly, truly evil human being.<br><br>2513<br>02:07:01,035 --> 02:07:06,537<br>I mean, what comparison is there,<br>ever, possibly in that?<br><br>2514<br>02:07:06,581 --> 02:07:08,540<br>And yet the "New York Times,"<br><br>2515<br>02:07:08,584 --> 02:07:09,875<br>...the newspaper of

of writing,<br><br>2518<br>02:07:14,924 --> 02:07:16,484<br>...especially for the business section.<br><br>2519<br>02:07:16,509 --> 02:07:19,634<br>Well, why do you think they made that comparison?<br><br>2520<br>02:07:19,678 --> 02:07:22,845<br>- You know, when I turned myself in...<br>- Your sons turned you in.<br><br>2521<br>02:07:22,889 --> 02:07:24,473<br>No, no, but I turned myself in.<br><br>2522<br>02:07:24,517 --> 02:07:26,599<br>It was a matter of a few days,<br>so I was gonna do it.<br><br>2523<br>02:07:26,643 --> 02:07:28,768<br>So anyway, when I turned myself in...<br><br>2524<br>02:07:31,065 --> 02:07:33,265<br>...it was the height of the whole<br>anti-Wall Street hysteria...<br><br>2525<br>02:07:33,275 --> 02:07:35,016<br>...and they needed a villain,<br>they needed a face...<br><br>2526<br>02:07:35,026 --> 02:07:36,267<br>...for the whole mess they created.<br><br>2527<br>02:07:36,277 --> 02:07:39,362<br>That face became me,<br>so that's...<br><br>2528<br>02:07:39,406 --> 02:07:41,240<br>I don't know, I just...<br><br>2529<br>02:07:41,282 --> 02:07:43,575<br>I don't even wanna think about it.<br><br>2530<br>02:07:43,619 --> 02:07:45,619<br>Think about what?<br><br>2531<br>02:07:45,662 --> 02:07:47,579<br>Well, he killed people,<br>innocent people.<br><br>2532<br>02:07:47,623 --> 02:07:50,415<br>And in my case,<br>I told people, everyone,<br><br>2533<br>02:07:50,459 --> 02:07:52,118<br>"Don't put more than half your money with me."<br><br>2534<br>02:07:52,128 --> 02:07:53,626<br>"You never know.<br>Who the hell knows?"<br><br>2535<br>02:07:53,670 --> 02:07:55,545<br>"I mean, one day,<br>I could just go crazy."<br><br>2536<br>02:07:55,589 --> 02:07:57,964<br>But the reality is people are greedy.<br><br>2537<br>02:07:58,008 --> 02:08:02,260<br>Hmm, the reality is that<br>not even your warning was true...<br><br>2538<br>02:08:02,303 --> 02:08:05,304<br><i>...and you took their money anyway.</i><br><br>2539<br>02:08:12,897 --> 02:08:15,148<br>Let me ask you a question.<br><br>2540<br>02:08:16,818 --> 02:08:19,152<br>Do you think I'm a sociopath?<br><br>
