Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth. God, I hate this place. It\\'s a chick\\'s restaurant. Why aren\\'t we at Dorsia? Because Bateman won\\'t give the maitre d\\' head. Is that Reed Robinson over there? Are you freebasing or what? That\\'s not Robinson? Well, who is it then? It\\'s Paul Allen? That\\'s not Paul Allen. Paul Allen\\'s on the other side of the room over there. Who\\'s he with? Some weasel from Kicker Peabody. They don\\'t have a good bathroom to do coke in. Are you sure that\\'s Paul Allen over there? Yes, McDufus, I am? He\\'s handling the Fisher account? Lucky bastard? Lucky Jew bastard? Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything? I\\'ve seen that bastard sitting in his office talking on the phone to the C? E.O? s, spinnin\\' a fuckin\\' menorah. Not a menorah. You spin a dreidel. Oh, my God, Bateman. Do you want me to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes? No, just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks. Oh, I forgot. Bateman\\'s dating someone from the A? C.L? U. He\\'s the voice of reason. The boy next door. Speaking of reasonable Only $570. That\\'s not bad. A little something for the purse. Give her the 50. Stoli on the rocks. These aren\\'t good anymore. It\\'s a cash bar. That\\'ll be $25. You\\'re a fucking ugly bitch. I wanna stab you to death and play around with your blood. What can I get for you two? I live in the American Gardens building on West st Street on the th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I\\'m  years old. I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I\\'ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser. Then a honey-almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb mint facial masque, which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman. Some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me. Only an entity something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there. Good morning. Good morning, Hamilton. Nice tan. Late. Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages? Ricky Harrison has to cancel. He didn\\'t say what he was cancelling or why. I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else? Spencer wants to meet for drinks at Fluties, Pier 17. When? After 6:00. And what should I say? Negative. Cancel it. Just say \"no.\" Just say \"no\"? Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at 12:30, and if not there try Crayons. All right? Yes, sir. Oh, wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at 8: on Thursday. Something romantic? No. Silly. Forget it. I\\'ll make them. No, I\\'ll do it. No, no. Be a doll and just get me a mineral water, okay? You look nice today. Don\\'t wear that outfit again. What? I didn\\'t hear you. I said, do not wear that outfit again. Wear a dress, a skirt or something. You don\\'t like this, I take it. Come on. You\\'re prettier than that? Thanks, Patrick.- I\\'m not here. And high heels. I like high heels. Feathered friends for 600. During courtship, the male frigate bird inflates to enormous size the red pouch found here. And I want hundreds of thousands of roses. And lots of chocolate truffles, Godiva, and oysters in the half shell. I\\'m trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape, but Evelyn, my supposed fianc?, keeps buzzing in my ear. Annie Leibovitz. We\\'ll get Annie Leibovitz. And we\\'ll have to get someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it. Do what? Get married. Have a wedding. No. I can\\'t take the time off work. Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.  I don\\'t want to talk about it? I hate that job anyway. I don\\'t see why you just don\\'t quit. Because I want to fit in. Williams party. I\\'m on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace, since I\\'m positive we won\\'t have a decent table. But we do, and relief washes over me in an awesome wave. Patrick, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. They\\'re both artists. The menu\\'s in braille. I see you\\'ve met everyone. You look awful. Okay. All right. I\\'m fairly certain that Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know. I\\'m almost completely indifferent as to whether Evelyn knows I\\'m having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, her closest friend. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She\\'s usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight, I believe, it\\'s Xanax. Mmm. Oh. More disturbing than her drug use, though, is the fact that she\\'s engaged to Luis Carruthers, the biggest doofus in the business. Tell me, Stash. Do you think Soho is becoming too commercial?  Yes. I read that? Oh, who gives a rat\\'s ass? Hey, that affects us. Well, what about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn\\'t that affect us too? Do you know anything about Sri Lanka? How, like, the Sikhs are killing tons of Israelis over there? Come on, Bryce. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about.  Like what? Well, we have to end apartheid, for one, slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights, while also promoting equal rights for women. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values. Most importantly, we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people. Patrick, how thought provoking. Hello. Hello. Bleaching? Are you trying to say \"bleaching\"? Oh, my God. Two things. One: You can\\'t bleach a Cerruti. Out of the question. Two: I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very expensive sheets, and I really need them cleaned. Lady, if you don\\'t shut your fucking mouth, I will kill you. Now, listen. I have a lunch meeting at Hubert\\'s in  minutes with Ronald Harrison. I need those sheets cleaned by this afternoon. Listen, I can\\'t understand you! This is crazy! You\\'re a fool. I can\\'t cope with this stupid \"bitchee\"! Understand? Christ. Patrick? Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you. Hello. This is Isn\\'t it ridiculous, coming all the way up here? They really are the best. Then why can\\'t they get these stains out? I mean, can you talk to these people or something? I\\'m not getting anywhere.  Oh, what are those? Well, it\\'s  Cranberry juice. Cranapple? Really? Listen, if you could talk to them, I would really appreciate it. I\\'m really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert\\'s in  minutes. Hubert\\'s? That moved uptown, right? Oh, boy. Listen, I\\'ve gotta go. Thank you, Victoria. Maybe we could do lunch one day next week. I\\'m downtown quite often. What about a Saturday? I\\'m at work all the time. Next Saturday? Can\\'t, I\\'m afraid. Sure. At a matinee of Les Mis. Listen, I really gotta go. Oh, Christ. I\\'ll call you. Okay. Do. Listen, you\\'re dating Lewis, he\\'s in Arizona. You\\'re fucking me, and we haven\\'t made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight? Stop it. I\\'m On a lot of lithium? Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he\\'d call tonight. Pumpkin? Pumpkin, you\\'re dating an asshole. Mm-hmm. Pumpkin, you\\'re dating the biggest dickweed in New York. Pumpkin, you\\'re dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed. Patrick, stop calling me pumpkin, okay? I have to go. Courtney? Hmm? Dinner. I can\\'t. I\\'m thinking Dorsia. Dorsia\\'s nice. Wear something fabulous. Oh, yeah! Dorsia. Um, yes, I know it\\'s a little late, but is it possible to reserve a table for two at 8: or 8:30, perhaps? .a facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing. And then, to the Pottery Barn, where I got this little silver muffin dish. Is that Donald Trump\\'s car? God, Patrick. Shut up. You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump. I just want a child. Just two perfect children. Are we here? Yeah. This is Dorsia? Yes, dear. Courtney, you\\'re gonna have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York Matinee called it \"a playful but mysterious little dish.\" You\\'ll love it. And then the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that\\'ll follow nicely. Mmm. Thanks, Patrick. Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia. How impressive. How on Earth did you get a reservation there? Lucky, I guess. That\\'s a wonderful suit. Don\\'t tell me. Don\\'t tell me. Let me guess. Mmm, Valentino Couture? Uh-huh. Hmm. It looks so soft. Your compliment was sufficient, Luis. Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie. How the hell are you? Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead, Marcus Halberstram. It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P, and in fact does the same exact thing I do. He also has a penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have a slightly better haircut.  How\\'s the Ransom account going, Marcus? It\\'s, uh, all right. Really? That\\'s interesting. It\\'s not, uh, not great.  Oh, well, you know? So, how\\'s Cecilia?  She\\'s a great girl? Oh, yeah. I\\'m very lucky.  Mm-hmm? Hey, Allen, congratulations on the Fisher account.  Thank you, Baxter? Listen, Paul. Squash. Call me. How about Friday? No can do. I got an 8: res at Dorsia. Great sea urchin ceviche. Dorsia on Friday night? How\\'d he swing that? I think he\\'s lying.  Is that a gram? New card. What do you think? Whoa-ho. Very nice. Look at that. Picked them up from the printer\\'s yesterday. Good coloring. That\\'s bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail. It\\'s very cool, Bateman, but that\\'s nothing. Look at this. That is really nice. Eggshell with Romalian type. What do you think? Nice. Jesus. That is really super. How\\'d a nitwit like you get so tasteful? I can\\'t believe that Bryce prefers Van Patten\\'s card to mine. But wait. You ain\\'t seen nothin\\' yet. Raised lettering, pale nimbus white. Impressive. Very nice. Hmm. Let\\'s see Paul Allen\\'s card. Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh, my God. It even has a watermark. Is something wrong, Patrick? You\\'re sweating. Hello. Pat Bateman. You want some, uh, money? Some food?  Is this what you need? I\\'m-I\\'m hungry. Yeah. Cold out too, isn\\'t it? Why don\\'t you get a job? If you\\'re so hungry, why don\\'t you get a job? I lost my job. Why? You drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. Listen, what\\'s your name? Al. Hmm? Speak up. Come on. Al. Get a goddamn job, Al. You got a negative attitude. That\\'s what\\'s stopping you. You gotta get your act together. I\\'ll help you. You are so kind, mister. You\\'re a kind You\\'re a kind man. It\\'s okay. I can tell. Please, you gotta tell me what to do. You gotta help me. I\\'m so cold, I\\'m hungry. You know how bad you smell? You reek of shit. Do you know that? Al. I\\'m sorry. It\\'s just that I don\\'t know. I don\\'t have anything in common with you. Oh. Oh, thank you, mister. Thank you. I\\'m cold out here. You know what a fucking loser you are? What? What beautiful skin you have, Mr. Bateman. So fine, so smooth. I have all the characteristics of a human being flesh, blood, skin, hair but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside of me, and I don\\'t know why. My nightly blood lust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip. Hey, McCloy, what do you say? Hey, Hamilton. Have a holly, jolly Christmas. Is Allen still handling the Fisher account? Of course. Who else? Mistletoe alert. Merry Xmas, Patrick. Merry Xmas, Harry. Merry Christmas. You\\'re late, honey. Oh, yes, you are. I\\'m not late. I\\'ve been here the entire time. You just didn\\'t see me. Say hello to Snowball. Snowball says, \"Merry Christmas, Patrick.\" What is it? It\\'s a little baby piggly-wiggly, isn\\'t it? It\\'s a Vietnamese potbellied pig. They make darling pets. Don\\'t you? Don\\'t you? Stop scowling, Patrick. You\\'re such a grinch. And what does Mr. Grinch want for Christmas? And don\\'t say breast implants again. Allen. Marcus. Merry Christmas. How you been? Workaholic, I suppose? Haven\\'t seen you in a while. Hey, Hamilton. We\\'re goin\\' to Nell\\'s. Limo\\'s out front. We should have dinner. Maybe you could bring Cecilla? Yes, Cecilla. Oh, Cecilla would adore it. Well, then, let\\'s do it, Marcus. Great party. Thanks. Patrick, why is he calling you Marcus? Mistletoe alert. Marcus Halberstram for two at 7:00. No, I want to know, okay? I came here for the cilantro crawfish gumbo, which is, after all, the only excuse one could have for being in this restaurant, which is, by the way, almost completely empty. I\\'m very sorry, sir. J&B straight, and a Corona. Would you like to hear Double Absolut martini. Yes, sir. Would you like to hear the specials? Not if you want to keep your spleen. This is a real beehive of activity, Halberstram. This place is hot. Very hot. Listen, the mud soup and charcoal arugula are outrageous here. Yeah, well, you\\'re late. Hey, I\\'m a child of divorce. Give me a break. I see they\\'ve omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-O. We should\\'ve gone to Dorsia. I could\\'ve gotten us a table. Nobody goes there anymore. Is that Ivana Trump? Oh, geez, Patrick. I mean, Marcus. What are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at Texarkana? So, uh, wasn\\'t Rothchild originally handling the Fisher account? How\\'d you get it? Well, I could tell you that, Halberstram, but then I\\'d have to kill you. I like to dissect girls. Did you know I\\'m utterly insane? Great tan, Marcus. I mean, really impressive. Where do you tan? Salon. I\\'ve got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it. And, uh, Cecilla. How is she? Where is she tonight? Cecilla\\'s, uh Well, you know Cecilla. I think she\\'s having dinner with, um, Evelyn Williams. Evelyn? Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork. Another martini, Paul? You like Huey Lewis and the News? Um, they\\'re okay. They\\'re early work was a little too new wave for my taste. But when Sports came out in \\'83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He\\'s been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. Hey, Halberstram? Yes, Allen? Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you Do you have a dog? A little chow or something?  No, Allen? Is that a raincoat? Yes, it is. In \\'87, Huey released this Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is \"Hip To Be Square.\" The song\\'s so catchy, most people probably don\\'t listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it\\'s not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It\\'s also a personal statement about the band itself. Hey, Paul! Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fuckin\\' stupid bastard! You fucking bastard! He was completely naked and standing up on the table. He had no clothes on whatsoever, and he Patrick? Patrick. Is that you? No, Luis, it\\'s not me. You\\'re mistaken. This is my very good friend, Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We\\'re going to Nell\\'s. Gwendolyn\\'s father is buying it. Ooh. Where did you get that overnight bag? Jean-Paul Gaultier. When I get to Paul Allen\\'s place, I use the keys I took from his pocket before disposing of the body. There is a moment of sheer panic when I realize that Paul\\'s apartment overlooks the park and is obviously more expensive than mine. I calm myself and move into the bedroom, where I find his suitcase and start to pack. It\\'s time for Paul to take a little trip. Where do I send the bastard? Dallas? Paris? Singapore? London? I\\'ll send the asshole to London. Hi. This is Paul. I\\'ve been called away to London for a few days. Meredith, I\\'ll call you when I get back. Hasta la vista, baby. What is it? Patrick. Yes, Jean? There\\'s a Mr. Donald Kimball here to see you. Who? Detective Donald Kimball. Tell him I\\'m at lunch. Patrick, it\\'s only 10:30. I think he knows you\\'re here. Send him in, I guess. Now, John, you\\'ve gotta wear clothes in proportion to your physique. There are definite do\\'s and don\\'ts, good buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A bold-striped shirt calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties. Yes, always tip the stylist  percent. Listen, John, I\\'ve gotta go. T. Boone Pickens just walked in. Just joking. No, don\\'t tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John? Right. Got it. Sorry about that. No, I\\'m sorry. I should\\'ve made an appointment. Was that anything important? Oh, that? Just mulling over business problems, examining opportunities, exchanging rumors, spreading gossip. Hi. I\\'m Donald Kimball. Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you. Sorry to barge in on you like this. I know how busy you guys can get. So, what\\'s the, uh, topic of discussion? I\\'ve been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Allen. I see, yeah. Paul\\'s disappearance, yeah. So it\\'s nothing that official.  I just have some questions about Paul Allen and yourself? Coffee?  No, I\\'m okay? Apollinaris? No, I\\'m okay. Can you bring Mr Kimball. No, I\\'m okay. Mr. Kimball a bottle of Apollinaris. It\\'s no problem. So, what\\'s the topic of discussion? The disappearance of Paul Allen. Uh-huh, right. Well, I, um, haven\\'t I haven\\'t heard anything about the disappearance or anything. Not on page six, at least.  I think his family wants this kept quiet? Understandable. Lime?  No, really, I\\'m okay? You sure? I can always get you a lime. Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay? Shoot. Hold old are you? Twenty-seven. Where did you go to school? Harvard. Then Harvard Business School. Your address? The American Gardens Building, West st Street.  Nice. Very nice? Thanks. What can you tell me about Paul Allen? I\\'m at a loss. He was part of that whole Yale thing. \"Yale thing\"?  Yeah, Yale thing? What do you mean, \"Yale thing\"? Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual who did a lot of cocaine. That \"Yale thing.\" What kind of man was he, besides the information you\\'ve just given?  I hope I\\'m not being cross-examined here? You feel like that? No, not really. Where did Paul hang out? Hang out? Yeah, you know, hang out. Let me think. Um, the Newport, Harry\\'s, Fluties, Indochine, Nell\\'s, the Cornell Club, the New York Yacht Club. He had a yacht?  No, he just hung out there? And where did he go to school? Don\\'t you know this? I just wanted to know if you know. Before Yale, if I remember correctly, St. Paul\\'s. Listen, I just I just wanna help. I understand. Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints? Well, there\\'s a message on his answering machine that says he went to London.  Well, maybe he did, huh? His girlfriend doesn\\'t think so.  But has anyone seen him in London? Actually, yes. Hmm. But I\\'ve had a hard time getting actual verification. A Stephen Hughes said he saw him at a restaurant there. But I checked it out, and what happened is he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth for Paul, so  Had his apartment been burglarized? No, actually, it hadn\\'t. Toiletries were missing, a suit was gone, so was some luggage. That\\'s it. I mean, no one\\'s dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right? No, not yet. As I said, we\\'re not sure. Basically, no one\\'s seen or heard anything. So typical, isn\\'t it? It\\'s just strange. One day, someone\\'s walking around, going to work, alive, and then Nothing. People just disappear. The earth just opens up and swallows them. Eerie. Really eerie. Listen, you\\'ll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in  minutes. The Four Seasons? Isn\\'t that a little far uptown? I mean, aren\\'t you gonna be late? No, there\\'s one down here. Oh, really? I didn\\'t know that. Yeah, it\\'s very good. Listen, if anything else occurs to you, any information Absolutely. I\\'m  percent with you. Great. And thanks for your time, Mr. Bateman. Bye-bye. Good-bye. I haven\\'t seen you around here. You just haven\\'t been lookin\\'.  Would you like to see my apartment? I\\'m not supposed to. Do you wanna come to my apartment or not? I\\'m not supposed to, but I can make an exception. Do you take a credit card? I\\'m joking. Come on. Get in. I\\'d like a girl. Early s. Blonde, who does couples. Couples. And I really can\\'t stress blonde enough. Blonde. I\\'m Paul. My name\\'s Paul Allen. You got that? You\\'re Christie. You\\'re to respond only to Christie. Is that clear? That\\'s a very fine chardonnay you\\'re drinking. I want you to clean your vagina. No. From behind. Get on your knees. You have a very nice body. Mm-hmm? Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry off. Choose a robe not the Bijan and come and meet me and our guest in the living room for drinks. You\\'ve arrived. How lovely. Let me take your coat. I\\'m Paul. How good of you to come. Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I\\'m gonna call you Sabrina. I\\'m Paul Allen. So. Don\\'t you wanna know what I do? No. No, not really. Well, I work on Wall Street for Pierce & Pierce. Have you heard of it? You have a really nice place here, Paul. How much did you pay for it? Well, actually, that\\'s none of your business, Christie. But I can assure you, it certainly wasn\\'t cheap. No. No smoking. Not in here. Varda truffle? I don\\'t want you to get drunk, but that\\'s a very fine chardonnay you\\'re not drinking. Do you like Phil Collins? I\\'ve been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their  album Duke. Before that, I really didn\\'t understand any of their work. It was too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins\\' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch is the group\\'s undisputed masterpiece. It\\'s an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christie, take off the robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don\\'t you, uh, dance a little. Take the lyrics to \"Land of Confusion.\" In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. \"In Too Deep\" is the most moving pop song of the s about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as, uh, anything I\\'ve heard in rock. Christie, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collins\\' solo career seems to be more commercial, and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially songs like \"In the Air Tonight\" and \"Against All Odds.\" Sabrina, don\\'t just stare at it. Eat it. I also think that Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group than as a solo artist. And I stress the word \"artist.\" This is \"Sussudio.\" A great, great song. A personal favorite. Look at the camera. Christie, look at the camera. Don\\'t touch the watch. Can we go now? We\\'re not through yet. If they have a good personality and they\\'re not great looking, then who fucking cares? Let\\'s just say hypothetically, okay? What if they have a good personality? I know. I know. There are no girls with good personalities. A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut. The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented though God knows what the fuck that means are ugly chicks. Absolutely. And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are.  Do you know what Ed Gein said about women? Maitre d\\' at Canal Bar?  No, serial killer, Wisconsin, in the s? And what did Ed say? \"When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. \"One part of me wants to take her out and talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right.\"  And what did the other part of him think? What her head would look like on a stick. Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something. It\\'s my business card. I decided to get a new one too. Oh, it\\'s Very nice, Luis. Thank you. Listen, what about dinner? Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? \"What about fucking dinner\"? Cheer up there, Bateman. What\\'s the matter? No shiatsu this morning? Keep touching me like that, you\\'ll draw back a stump. Hold on there, little buddy. Excuse me. God. Patrick. Why here? I\\'ve seen you looking at me. I\\'ve noticed your hot body. Don\\'t be shy. You can\\'t imagine how long I\\'ve wanted this ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206. You know, the one you were wearing that red-striped paisley Armani tie. I want you. I want you too. Patrick. What is it? Where are you going? I\\'ve gotta return some video tapes. Patrick! Okay, London the London, there\\'s, um, a reservation Any Paul Allen? No. A reservation, but Kimball! I\\'ve been wanting to talk with you. Come into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuta? Do you remember where you were the night of Paul\\'s disappearance, which was on the th of December? God. I guess I was probably returning video tapes. I had a date with a girl named Veronica. That\\'s not what I\\'ve got. What? That\\'s not the information I\\'ve received. Well, I Wait.  What information have you received? Let me see. Well You were with Well, I could be wrong. When was the last time you were with Paul Allen? We\\'d gone to a new musical called Oh, Africa, Brave Africa. It was a laugh riot. That was about it. I think we had dinner at Orso\\'s. No, Peto No, Orso\\'s. I hope I\\'ve been informative. Long day, a bit scattered. I\\'m a little spent now too. But how about lunch in a week or so when I\\'ve sorted out all this information? Great. Yes, I\\'d like that. And if you could try and pin down where you were 623. the night of Paul Allen\\'s disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier. Never. I mean, I don\\'t really like singers. Absolutely. I\\'m with you on that one. Not a big music fan, huh? No, I like music. Just they\\'re Huey\\'s too black sounding for me. Huey Lewis and the News. To each his own. Great stuff. I just bought it on my way here. You heard it? So, lunch next week? I\\'ll be there. Oh! Oh! Will you call me before Easter? Maybe. What are you doing tonight? Dinner at, uh, River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe. That\\'s nice. I never knew you smoked. You never noticed. Listen, Patrick. Can we talk? You look marvelous. There\\'s nothing to say. You\\'re gonna marry Luis. Isn\\'t that special? Patrick? Yes, Courtney? If I don\\'t see you before Easter, have a nice one, okay? You too. Patrick? Yeah? Nothing. There is this theory now Listen to me. There is this theory now that if you can catch the AIDS virus by having sex with someone who\\'s infected, then you can catch anything. Alzheimer\\'s, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia. I\\'m not sure, but I don\\'t think dyslexia is a virus. But who knows? They don\\'t know that. Prove it. Oh, God. What? It\\'s a fucking milligram of sweetener. I wanna get high off this, not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal. It\\'s definitely weak, but I have a feeling if we do enough of it, we\\'ll be okay. Can you keep it down? I\\'m trying to do drugs. Fuck you! Calm down. Let\\'s do it anyway. That\\'s right. That is if the faggot in the next stall thinks it\\'s okay! Fuck you! Hey, fuck you! Sorry, dude. Steroids. Okay, let\\'s do it. Where did Craig go? Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott went to sign a peace treaty between the United States and Russia. He\\'s the one behind Glasnost.  He said he was in mergers and acquisitions? You\\'re not confused, are you? No, not really.  Gorbachev is not downstairs? Karen\\'s right. Gorbachev\\'s not downstairs. He\\'s at Tunnel. Ask me a question. So, what do you do? I\\'m into, uh, well, murders and executions, mostly.  Do you like it? Well, it depends. Why? Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions really don\\'t like it. So, where do you work out? You think I\\'m dumb, don\\'t you? What? You think I\\'m dumb. You think all models are dumb. No. I really don\\'t. That\\'s okay. I don\\'t mind. There\\'s something sweet about you. Doin\\' the crossword? You need any help?  Jean? Yes, Patrick? Would you like to accompany me to dinner? That is, if you\\'re not doing anything. Um, no. No, I don\\'t have any plans. Well, isn\\'t this a coincidence? Listen, where should we go? Anywhere you want. Let\\'s not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want? I don\\'t know, Patrick. I can\\'t make this decision. Come on. Where do you wanna go? Anywhere you want, just say it. I can get us in anywhere. What about Dorsia? So, Dorsia is where Jean wants to go. Well, I don\\'t know. We\\'ll go wherever you wanna go. Dorsia is fine. Dorsia. Yes? Yeah, can you take two tonight at, oh, let\\'s say 9:00? We\\'re totally booked. Really? That\\'s great. No, I said we are totally booked. Two at 9:00? Perfect. See ya then. Yeah? You\\'re dressed okay.  You didn\\'t give a name? They know me. Why don\\'t you meet me at my place at 7:. for drinks. And Jean, you\\'ll wanna change before we go out. Patrick, it\\'s so elegant. What a wonderful view. Jean, sorbet? Thanks, Patrick. I\\'d love some. Do you want a bite? I\\'m on a diet. But thank you. You don\\'t need to lose any weight. You\\'re kidding, right? You look great. Very fit. You can always be thinner, look better. Well, maybe we shouldn\\'t go out to dinner. I don\\'t wanna ruin your willpower. No, it\\'s all right. I\\'m not very good at controlling it anyway. So listen. What do you really wanna do with your life? Just briefly, summarize. And don\\'t tell me you enjoy working with children, okay? Well, I\\'d like to travel and maybe go back to school, but I don\\'t really know. I\\'m at a point in my life where there seems to be so many possibilities, but I\\'m I don\\'t know I\\'m just so unsure. Do you have a boyfriend? No, not really. Interesting. Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously? Maybe. I don\\'t know. Not really. Jean, do you feel fulfilled? I mean, in your life? I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work. But now I\\'ve really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing and growing. Growing. I\\'m glad you said that. Did you know that, uh, Ted Bundy\\'s first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this? Who\\'s Ted Bundy? Forget it. What\\'s that? Duct tape. I need it for, uh, taping something. Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy? What? No! Put it in the carton. Sorry. Jean? What? Uh, make someone happy? Have you ever wanted to? I\\'m looking for, uh, I guess you could say I just wanna have a meaningful relationship with someone special. Hmm. Patrick? Patrick? I know you\\'re there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy. What are you up to tonight? It\\'s me. Don\\'t try to hide. I hope you\\'re not with some little number you picked up because you\\'re my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway, you never called me and you said you would, and I\\'ll leave a message for Jean about this, too, to remind you, but we\\'re having dinner with Melania and Taylor. You know Melania. She went to Sweet Briar. And we\\'re meeting at the Cornell Club, so I\\'ll call you tomorrow morning, honey. Oops. Sorry. I know you hate that. Bye, Patrick. Bye, Mr. Big Time C? E.O. Bye-bye. Was that Evelyn? Are you still seeing her? I\\'m sorry. I have no right to ask that. Do you want me to go? Yeah. I don\\'t think I can control myself. I know. I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men. I mean, do you want me to go? I think if you stay, something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don\\'t wanna get hurt, do you? No. No, I guess not. I don\\'t wanna get bruised. You\\'re right. I should go. Oh. Don\\'t forget you have a lunch date tomorrow with Donald Kimball at Smith and Wolenski\\'s. Thanks. It slipped my mind completely. So, the night he disappeared any new thoughts about what you did? Not sure. Um, I had a shower and some sorbet? I think you\\'re getting your dates mixed up. But how? Where do you place Paul that night? According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with Marcus Halberstram. And? I questioned him.  Marcus? Yes, and he denies it, though, at first, he couldn\\'t be sure. But he denied it. Yes. Well, does Marcus have an alibi? Yes. He does? You\\'re sure? I checked it out. It\\'s clean. Now, where were you? Where was Marcus? He wasn\\'t with Paul Allen. Who was he with? He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and you. Oh, right, yeah. Of course. We had wanted Paul Allen to come, but he had made plans. And I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night. Personally, I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London, sightseeing, drinking, whatever. Anyway, I\\'m pretty sure he\\'ll turn up sooner or later. I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn\\'t that right, Patrick? Christie. Christie. I\\'m not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time. This won\\'t be anything like last time. I promise. I don\\'t think so. Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. The driver\\'s here. You\\'ll be safe. Nothing like last time. Promise. All right. So, you\\'re looking great. How have you been? Well, I actually might need surgery after last time. Really? My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer. Lawyers are so complicated. Don\\'t do that. Here\\'s a check. Uh-uh. Half now, half later. Okay, your name is Christie. We\\'re meeting a friend of mine, Elizabeth. She\\'ll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. You\\'ll like her. She\\'s a very nice girl. You look really familiar. Did you go to Dalton? I think I met you at Surf Bar, didn\\'t I? With Spicey? Well, maybe not with Spicey, but definitely at Surf Bar. You know, Surf Bar. Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now. It\\'s terrible. Went to a birthday party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh, my God, please. This is nicer than your other apartment. Oh, it\\'s not that nice. Where did you two meet? Oh, God. We met at oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby in \\'85, or \\'86. You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole. Hot number. What do you mean? She was a hot number. If you had a platinum card, she\\'d give you a blow job. This girl worked in a tanning salon. What do you do? She\\'s my cousin. Uh-huh. She\\'s from France. Where\\'s your phone? I\\'ve gotta call Harley. Where do you summer, South Hampton?  No? Oh, God, it\\'s his machine. It\\'s 3: in the morning. He\\'s a goddamn drug dealer. These are his peak hours. Don\\'t tell him you\\'re here. Why would I? This tastes weird. Harley, it\\'s me. I need your services. Translate that however you want.  I\\'m atPaul Allen\\'s. Who? Paul Allen\\'s. I want the number, idiot. Anyway, I\\'m at Paul Norman\\'s and I\\'ll try you again later. And if I don\\'t see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I\\'m gonna sic my hairdresser on you. Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn\\'t he work at Pierce & Pierce? Was he a friend of yours? No. Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I would take a Halcyon. Listen. I would just like to see the two of you get it on. What\\'s wrong with that? It\\'s totally disease free. Patrick, you\\'re a lunatic. Come on. Don\\'t you find Christie attractive? Let\\'s not get lewd. I\\'m in no mood for a lewd conversation. Come on. I think it\\'d be a turn-on. Does he do this all the time? Christie, you\\'re not drinking your wine. Are you telling me you\\'ve never gotten it on with a girl? No. I\\'m not a lesbian. Why would you think I would be into that? Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing. Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You\\'re making me feel weird. Did you know that Whitney Houston\\'s debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You own a Whitney Houston CD? More than one? It\\'s hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks. But the \"Greatest Love Of All\" is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation and dignity. Its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it\\'s not too late to better ourselves. Since, Elizabeth, it\\'s impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves. It\\'s an important message. Crucial, really. Not the face! You bitch, not the fucking face, you piece of bitch trash! Aaah! I want a firm commitment. I think, um, Evelyn, that, uh, we\\'ve lost touch. Why? What\\'s wrong? My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs. We need to talk. Talk about what, Patrick? It\\'s over, Evelyn. It\\'s all over. Touchy, touchy. I\\'m sorry I brought up the wedding. Let\\'s just avoid the issue, all right? Now, are we having coffee? I\\'m fucking serious. It\\'s fucking over, us. This is no joke. Uh, I don\\'t think we should see each other anymore. But your friends are my friends and my friends are your friends. I really don\\'t think it would work. You have a little something I know that your friends are my friends, and, uh and I\\'ve thought about that. You can have \\'em. You\\'re really serious, aren\\'t you? Yes, I am.  What about the past? Our past? We never really shared one. You\\'re inhuman. No. I\\'m in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I\\'m, uh, sorry. I just, uh You\\'re not terribly important to me. Oh, no! No. No, Patrick. I know my behavior can be erratic sometimes. What do you want me to do? What is it that you want? If you really wanna do something for me, then stop making this scene right now. Oh, God, I can\\'t believe this. I\\'m leaving. I\\'ve assessed the situation, and I\\'m going. Where are you going? I\\'m just leaving. But where? I have to return some videotapes. Here, kitty, kitty. Oh, my God. What are you doing? Stop that. Drop the weapon! Drop it now! Get on the ground! Put your Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? Hey, now don\\'t forget to sign in. Howard, it\\'s Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You\\'re my lawyer, so I think you should know I\\'ve killed a lot of people. Some escort girls in an apartment uptown, uh, some homeless people, maybe five or ten, an N? Y.U. girl I met in Central Park. I left her at a parking lot behind some doughnut shop. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun. And-And-And then some man, s-s-some old faggot with a dog. Last week, I, uh I killed another girl with a chain saw. I had to. She almost got away. And Someone else there. I can\\'t remember, maybe a model She\\'s dead too. And, uh, Paul Allen. I killed Paul Allen with an ax in the face. His body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell\\'s Kitchen. I don\\'t wanna leave anything out here. I guess I\\'ve killed maybe  people. Maybe 40! I have tapes of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even, um, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little. Tonight, I, uh I just had to kill a lot of people! And, um, I\\'m not sure I\\'m gonna get away with it this time. So, uh I mean, I guess I\\'m a pretty, uh I mean, I guess I\\'m a pretty sick guy. So, if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Harry\\'s Bar. So, you know, keep your eyes open. Okay. Oh! Are you my 2:00? No. Can I help you? I\\'m looking for Paul Allen\\'s place. Doesn\\'t he live here? No, he doesn\\'t. You sure? You saw the ad in the Times? No. Yeah. I mean, yeah. In the Times. There was no ad in the Times. I think you should go now. But I think I wanna know what happened here. Don\\'t make any trouble, please. I suggest you go. Don\\'t come back. I won\\'t. Don\\'t worry. Patrick Bateman\\'s office. Jean? I need help. Patrick, is that you? Jean, I\\'m not Craig McDermott called. Wants to meet you, David Van Patten and Tim Bryce at Harry\\'s. Oh, God. What did you say, you dumb bitch? Patrick, I can\\'t hear you. What am I doing? Where are you, Patrick? What\\'s wrong? I don\\'t think I\\'m gonna make it, Jean, to the, uh, office this afternoon. Why? Just say no! What is it, Patrick? Are you all right? Stop sounding so fucking sad. Jesus! That\\'s a table for three. Bateman, you\\'re looking wild-eyed. Rough day? Hey, look. Bryce is back and he\\'s drinking mineral water. He\\'s a changed man, except for he still can\\'t a reservation to save his life. Why don\\'t you just try  Wooster? I\\'m not going anywhere unless we have a reservation. Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar. Come on, faggots. Let\\'s get a \"res.\" Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders. Need a reservation for 8:30. Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. 0810: would not be any good. No. Just fucking call them. Give me the phone. I\\'ll do it. I\\'ll call you back. Face it. The Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the \\'s. Shut up, Carnes. They will not. So, uh, Harold, did you get my message? Jesus, yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn\\'t it? Yeah, naturally. Bateman killing Allen and the escort girls. That\\'s fabulous. That\\'s rich. What exactly do you mean? The message you left. By the way, Davis, how\\'s Cynthia? You\\'re still seeing her, right? W-Wait, Harold. What do you mean? Excuse me. Nothing. It\\'s good to see you. Is that Edward Towers? Carnes, wait. Uh Davis, I\\'m not one to bad-mouth anyone. Your joke was amusing. But come on, man. You had one fatal flaw: Bateman is such a dork. Such a boring, spineless lightweight. Now, if you said Bryce or McDermott. Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, if you\\'ll excuse me, I really must be going. Wait. Uh Stop. I did it, Carnes. I killed him. I\\'m Patrick Bateman. I chopped Allen\\'s fucking head off. The whole message I left on your machine was true. Excuse me. I really must be going now. No. No, listen. Don\\'t you know who I am? I\\'m not Davis. I\\'m Patrick Bateman. We talk on the phone all the time. Don\\'t you recognize me? You\\'re my lawyer. Now, Carnes, listen. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Allen, and I liked it. I can\\'t make myself any clearer. But that\\'s simply not possible. And I don\\'t find this funny anymore. It never was supposed to be. Why isn\\'t it possible? It\\'s just not. Why not, you stupid bastard? Because I had dinner with Paul Allen twice in London just ten days ago. No, you didn\\'t. Now, if you\\'ll excuse me. We\\'ve seen the results of that mistrust in the form of lies, provisions in the states. We need to find a way to cooperate while realizing foreign policy can\\'t be run by committee. And I believe there\\'s now the growing sense that we can accomplish more by cooperating. And in the end, this may be the eventual blessing in disguise to come out of the Iran-Contra mess. How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit? What shit? Now, where do we have reservations at? I\\'m not really hungry, but I\\'d like to have reservations someplace. How can you be so fucking, I don\\'t know, cool about it? Some guys are just born cool, I guess. Bateman?  What are you so fucking zany about? I\\'m just a happy camper. Rockin\\' and a rollin\\'! Oh, brother, look. He presents himself as this harmless old codger, but inside but inside But inside doesn\\'t matter. Inside? Believe or not, Bryce, we\\'re actually listening to you. Come on, Bateman. What do you think?  Whatever? Whose moronic idea was it to order dry beers? I need a scotch. There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it, I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. My punishment continues to elude me and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing. Word. Come on.'),\n",

       "   'Your breakfast, sir. Pork bellies! I have a hunch something exciting is going to happen in the pork belly market this morning. Will Miss Penelope be dining with you this evening, sir? Yes. Yes, she will? Good morning, Mr Winthorpe? Morning, Folsey? Morning, Mr Winthorpe? Good morning? Morning, Mr Winthorpe? Morning? Morning, Mr Winthorpe? Morning. Good morning, Mr Winthorpe? Morning, Mr Winthorpe? Morning, Mr Winthorpe? Good morning, Mr Winthorpe? Morning? Good morning, Mr Winthorpe? Morning. Pork bellies. I knew it. I knew it!Good morning, Mr Duke? Good morning, Mr Duke? Good morning, Mr Duke? Morning, Mr Duke? Morning, Mr Duke? Morning, Mr Duke? Mr Duke? Good morning, Mr Duke. Good morning, Mr Duke. When do we sell? How stupid these scientists are! The eternal question! There is no question. The answer\\'s obvious. I don\\'t care about heredity versus environment. I\\'m sick and tired of hearing it. I care how much we get for our pork bellies. Winthorpe will sell at  and a quarter. His charts say that\\'s as high as it\\'ll go. It\\'ll never get that high. Let\\'s sell now. Patience, Mortimer. Let\\'s see if Winthorpe\\'s right. Winthorpe\\'s wrong. It\\'s topped out. I say we sell now? Just another few seconds? The market\\'s closing. We won\\'t get the order in. We just made an extra $347,000. Get me Winthorpe. Well, I never had an instant of doubt in my mind, Mortimer. Yes, I\\'m sure a lot of people went belly-up on that one. I\\'ll see you at the club. Morning Mr Duke. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Thank you very much. Vietnam did this to me but I\\'m not bitter, thank you. Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukkah? Spare a poor war veteran some change? I\\'m on my knees for life. I have no money to give you. Please, anything. A quarter, just a couple of dollars. Anything, a quarter, a nickel, please. Hey, man, I really don\\'t appreciate this. I don\\'t care what it is, smoked ham, anything, a jacket. Thanks! How\\'d you like a stump up your ass? Stay outta here!You\\'ve got a lot of soul. I appreciate it. Listen to this. \"Expect this stagnation to continue, \"until the Department Of Agriculture\\'s January crop report.\" Exactly as we thought, Randolph. Wrong! Quite wrong. Untrue. They\\'ve given this genetics fellow the Nobel Prize. He doesn\\'t know the first thing about human nature. We\\'re about to make millions of dollars in frozen orange juice and you\\'re talking about human nature. Money isn\\'t everything. Grow up. Mother always said you were greedy. She meant it as a compliment. Ezra, right on time. I bet you thought I\\'d forgotten your Christmas bonus. There you are. Five dollars! Maybe I\\'ll go to the movies by myself? Half of it is from me? Thank you, Mr Mortimer? Gentlemen? Looking good, Louis. Feeling good, Todd. We need a fourth for squash today, Louis. Are you interested? No can do. I\\'ll be having dinner with Penelope, tonight? Oh, lucky you? It\\'s not luck, Todd. Randolph, Mortimer. What have you got for us? It\\'s that time of the month again. Payroll cheques for our employees, which require your signatures. And no forgetting to sign the big ones. We are paying some of our employees an awful lot of money. You can\\'t get around the minimum wage. $50, to Clarence Beeks! Who the hell I meant to ask you about that. I went through our records, and there doesn\\'t seem to be a Clarence Beeks employed with the firm. Oh, Clarence Beeks. Yes, of course? He\\'s doing something top secret for us? Research. How is Penelope? Don\\'t forget she\\'s our grandnieceyou\\'d better make an honest woman of her. Well, I\\'ll certainly try, sir. The wedding invitations go out this week. Good. Good work, Winthorpe. Don\\'t worry about this, Winthorpe. I\\'ll take care of this one personally? Goodbye, Winthorpe? Goodbye, Winthorpe. Winthorpe is a very steady young man. We\\'re lucky to have him managing our firm. Oh, hogwash. Exeter, Harvardhe\\'s the product of good environment. It\\'s got nothing to do with environment. With his genes, you could put him anywhere and he\\'d come out on top. Breeding, same as in race horses. It\\'s in the blood. Hey, baby, what\\'s happening? How you doing? Once you\\'ve had a man with no legs, you never go back. I know what you\\'re thinking. You seen \"Porgy And Bess\"? We can make it, baby. Me and you. You bitch!  Who\\'s that? Who\\'s there? Police! We\\'ve had complaints about con men pretending to be blind and crippled. I ain\\'t seen nothing since I stepped on that landmine in Vietnam. It was very painful. You were in \\'Nam? So were we. Where? I was in Sang Bang Dang Gong I was all over the place, a lot of places. What unit? I was with the Green Berets, Special Unit Battalions Commando Airborne Tactics Specialist Tactics Unit Battalion. Yeah, it was real hush hush. I was Agent Orange, Special Agent Orange, that was me. Airborne, huh? I can see! I can see! I have I have legs. I have Oh shit, look at this. Legs! I can walk. Jesus, praise Jesus. I appreciate this. Oh, this is beautiful. I can\\'t believe Thank you. I don\\'t know what to do it\\'s Glory be to God. Praise Jesus. Look at me. This is too much. I can\\'t believe it. Ah, beautiful. Listen I can\\'t thank you. First Moses, now this. God, Jesus I\\'m so happy, oh God. Look at me, this is too much. What a happy day! Really, I appreciate it. Y\\'alls OK now. Look at this. I can walk. I don\\'t know what to say I\\'ll be all right. Take it easy. Y\\'all beautiful, both of you are, the two of you. How are you doing?  Oh, I\\'m sorry? Stop thief.  Help, help!What are you talking about, man? Don\\'t kill me, take it, please. I\\'m getting married.  I don\\'t want your bag? Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! He\\'s in there. After him.  Excuse me? Watch out. He probably has a weapon. Stop him. He has my briefcase. He\\'s inside. That guy\\'s crazy. He\\'s getting away. There he is. That\\'s him. Get him. He\\'s under the table. Somebody go under there. Right there. There he is. Is there a problem, officers? What in heaven\\'s name is going on here?  He tried to rob the payroll, Randolph? I didn\\'t, he bumped into me. I did not. You tried to grab my briefcase.  It was an accident? An accident, really?  What will happen to him? We\\'ll book him on assault, robbery, and resisting arrest. Well done, Winthorpe. I\\'m innocent. I was trying to give his briefcase back. I can\\'t go to jail cos of some ass-wipe. Officer, I would like to press full charges. People like this are a menace to decent society. You\\'re from a broken home of course? Yeah, it was broke. So what? You have a history of juvenile arrests, I presume? Drug abuse, reform school, state prisons and all that- I want a lawyer. Is there a lawyer in the house? That man is a product of a poor environment. There\\'s nothing wrong with him, I can prove it. Of course there\\'s something wrong with him He\\'s a Negro! He\\'s probably been stealing since he could crawl. Given the right surroundings and encouragement, I\\'ll bet that that man could run our company as well as Winthorpe. Are we talking about a wager, Randolph? I suppose you think Winthorpe say if he were to lose his job, would resort to holding up people on the streets. No, I don\\'t think that would be enough for Winthorpe. We\\'d have to heap a little more misfortune on those narrow shoulders. If he lost his job and his home and his fiancÃ©e and his friends. If he were somehow disgraced and arrested by the police and thrown in jail, even. Yes, I\\'m sure he\\'d take to crime like a fish to water. You\\'d have to put him in the wrong surroundings, with the worst sort of people. I mean real scum, Randolph. We\\'ve done it before. This time it\\'s in a good cause. How much do you want to bet?  The usual amount? Why not? You\\'re so brave, Louis. Someone has to take a stand against criminals. But he could have killed you. In such a situation, you have no time to thinkinstinct takes over. It\\'s either kill or be killed. Did Louis tell you what he did today? Mr Louis kindly shared this afternoon\\'s excitement with me, Miss Penelope. You\\'re so hot tempered, darling. I would have grovelled and begged for mercy. I want you Louis, now.  Coleman? Sir? We\\'ll take our drinks in the living room, by the fire.  No dessert, sir? You have it. Thank you, sir. Hello. Oh, hello Mr Duke, sir A what? A scientific experiment. Not at all, sir, no I It all sounds very original. Well, it\\'s your house and I work for you. I shall make the necessary arrangements. And a very good night to you, sir. What a scumbag. Mumsie wants to have a party for us right after New Year\\'s. January nd, is that good for you? OK with me, hon. Darn nice of her too. Oh, heck. nd January. Can\\'t do it.  Oh, Louis? It\\'s the day the crop reports come out. What do those stupid old crop reports have to do with Mumsie\\'s party? It\\'s the busiest time of year in the office, sugarpuff. It\\'s just not fair. Why can\\'t you make them do it another day? The Department Of Agriculture gets those estimates from all over the country. Pork bellies, soybeans, frozen orange juice. I\\'ll just have to ask Todd to take me. Now, wait just a minute. If you think I\\'m going to let that playboy Just teasing you. You know something, Witherspoon?  What? We are going to make a great couple. We\\'re going to have a great life.  Excuse me, sir? What is it? Will you be needing me any more, this evening, sir? No, I think I have everything I want. Good night, sir. I had to keep him under surveillance. I had to make sure he had his payroll before I made my move.  Tell us how you cut him? With no knife.  You told me you cut the dude? With these I cut him. I am a chain belt in Kung Fu. Bruce Lee was my teacher. That\\'s the \"quart of blood\" technique. Do it, a quart of blood drops out of a body.  Tell him how you beat on the cop? Cops, plural. Beat the shit out of ten cops and had to change my whole strategy around. When they brought you in and booked you, you was crying like a pussy.  Yeah? The cops threw tear gas in my face. I still walked in like a man, so get outta my face. You beating up a man, putting him in hospital.  How come I don\\'t see marks on you? Yeah. Cos I\\'m a karate man, all right. Karate men bruise on the inside They don\\'t show their weaknesses. You don\\'t know that, motherfucker. Now get off my back, all right. I wish my bitches would hurry up. I ain\\'t got time to be here. Where is your bitches, Mr Big Time Pimp? Yeah. Didn\\'t I tell you, the phone in my limousine is busted and I can\\'t get in contact with my bitches. Yeah, the phone in the limo had busted. Are you ignorant?  Look, sit down, all right? Lt ain\\'t cool being no jive turkey so close to Thanksgiving. Hey, now You boys don\\'t know what you\\'re doing, I can see that already. Do you know who you\\'re fucking with? Back the fuck up, back up. D\\'you know who you\\'re fucking with in cell number four on the ninth floor.  Billy Ray Valentine? Yes. Move it.  You made bail? I did? May I suggest using a night stick, officer? Get outta here. Mr Valentine. Could you spare us a moment?  Don\\'t I know you two guys? Step inside, nice and warm in here.  Whisky, all you want? I ain\\'t falling for the same trick twice. You\\'d get me in the car, and have me arrested for stealing it. Why should we do that, Mr Valentine? We\\'re the ones who bailed you out. Who are y\\'all? What y\\'all want? We want to help you. My brother and I run a privately funded programme, to rehabilitate culturally disadvantaged people. We\\'d like to supply you with a home of your own, a car, a generous bank account, and employment with our company. We\\'re going to start you at $80, a year.  $80,000?Mmm. Excuse me. This is a practical joke, right, brother? Then these dudes are a couple of faggots, huh? What\\'s my next move, man? Thank you, you\\'ve been helpful.  What about the payroll? We\\'ve had the charges dropped. You\\'re a free man, Valentine. We can stop right now and you can walk out on us forever. No, I believe I can hang out with you fellas for a while.  Excellent? I\\'m Randolph Duke. How you doing Randy, what\\'s happening?  My younger brother, Mortimer? Hey Morty! What it is. Billy Ray Valentine, Capricorn. Randy, that\\'s like Randy Jackson from the Jackson Five, right?  Yes, I suppose so? Yeah. Here we are, William. How you doing? Hey, Randy, Morty. This is nice, I like this.  WilliamBilly Ray. William, this is Coleman. He\\'ll look after your day-to-day needs.  Can I relieve you of those? You get a glass, I\\'ll give you a sip.  Perhaps, your coat, sir? Yes, this is my coat. Coleman is here to take care of you. He is your servant.  May I? Get out of here. Valentine very badly wants to take a hot bath and get into something comfortable. Don\\'t you, Valentine? Jacuzzi, sir? I knew you was faggots. You ain\\'t Jacuzzying nobody. It\\'s a whirlpool bath sir. I think you\\'ll enjoy it. Bubbles, man! Say, when I was growing up, we want a Jacuzzi, we had to fart in the tub. This is bad!  What\\'s he doing in there? He\\'s singing, sir. They\\'re very musical people, aren\\'t they?  What shall I do with his clothes? Send them to the laundry. He\\'ll need them to wear back to the ghetto, after I\\'ve won our bet.  Well, what do you think? I like it, Randy, very nice. I like the way you have the mirror and stuff.  I don\\'t think he understands? Morty, I do understand.  William, this is your home? Right.  It belongs to you? Yeah, I like my home. It\\'s very nice.  I have nice taste in houses? Everything here is yours.  This is my stuff? Your own property.  My own personal shit? You understand? Yeah, I like that. You know what I like most? The curtains, it\\'s beautiful the way I\\'ve set this place up. This is something else. I like it. The cabinets. Beautiful. I suppose you\\'ll give me this TV set for free?  That\\'s right? Everything here is mine?  I guess the stereo\\'s mine too? Absolutely. This is too much. I could really dig this. You know why? This happens to me every week. This is your house. These are your personal possessions. You will only be stealing from yourself. Look, first you throw my ass in jail. Then you run me some garbage about how this is my house, this is my rug and this is my personal slave too. I understand how you feel but the fact remains, all this is yours. You may do with it whatever you wish. This is my stuff. I can do what I want with it, right? This is my vase, Billy Ray\\'s vase? I can play Harlem Globetrotters shit with it, like Meadow Lark Lemon?  Hey man, I\\'m sorry about that? Perfectly all right, it was your vase. That was a fake, right? I think we paid $35, for it. But, I seem to remember we estimated its value at $50, for the insurance. You see, Mortimer? William has already made us a profit of $15,000. You want me to break something else? No. Excuse me. I hope we\\'re not pushing it, using Mr Beeks for this, as well as the crop report. We are involved in a very important scientific experiment, Mortimer and Mr Beeks has always proven reliable. Excuse me Sorry. Hello, Todd. Gents. Gentlemen. There is something rotten in the Heritage Club. Something that has never raised its vile head in the  years of the club\\'s history. There is a thief, and he\\'s sitting here among us. Not an ordinary thief like the man Winthorpe had the guts to stand up to yesterday. No, this man is a hundred times lower. I\\'d like to introduce Mr Beeks of Lyndhurst Security. Thank you. I\\'d like to ask you gentlemen to all stand up. I\\'d like to ask you to place your left hand on the shoulder of the man to your left. I would now ask you to place your right hand in the coat pocket of the member to your right. And empty the contents of those pockets onto the table. Thank you. You may sit. We marked three $ bills with red X\\'s. Less than ten minutes ago those bills were stolen from a coat in the cloakroom. One of our operatives witnessed the theft. Now, wait a minute. I\\'ve never seen this money before in my life. Randolph, Mortimer, this is outrageous. I haven\\'t done anything wrong. Oh, Winthorpe. I\\'m glad your parents are not alive to see this. Wait, this is preposterous. This is insane. I have no reason to steal. I\\'m not a thief. I demand a fair hearing. At least grant me that. You realise you\\'re making a grave mistake. Boy, are you two going to be sorry. You know who I am? Yeah, Winthorpe Louis III. I\\'m permitted two calls, point me to the phone.  Take off your clothes? Wait, I know my rights. Take off your clothes. You are making a career decision here. Now, you\\'d better think about it. Because you\\'ll have to live with it for the rest of your life. Strip, before I tear you a new asshole. Did you hear what this man said? Now, I have witnesses. This man is physically threatening me. Winthorpe Louis the third. All right. One gold watch. One alligator skin wallet. Master Charge, American Express Gold Card. Visa, Diner\\'s Club, Carte Blanche. Two tickets  \"La Bo-heem\"\"La BohÃ¨me\"it\\'s an opera. It\\'s an opera.  One cellophane bag? I\\'ve never seen that before in my life. That\\'s PCPphencyclidine. Angel dust. You ever seen what this stuff does to kids? You\\'re looking at three to five, mandatory Louis. What\\'s happening, Terry? Gimme a bottle of your best champagne. You\\'ve got a nerve, showing your face here after all this time. Look, man, I got your money. I got your poor measly$ with interest. Billy Ray, honey. Ls that you? Who do you think it is? Terence, get the lady some champagne. In fact, champagne for everybody, courtesy of Billy Ray Valentine. A toast to Billy Ray? I\\'m very sexy. People will say, \"Billy Ray, you\\'re sexy,\" and not understand my sexuality. I know. You was in the tank last night, braggin\\' on your limousine. You\\'re the motherfucker I was gonna carve. Yeah. Motherfucker? Moi? That\\'s my limousine outside, why don\\'t you take a look at it? Right outside? Yeah. You took care of him, baby. I was gonna kick his ass, but I\\'m a peaceful man. Ladies, it\\'s time for me to get home. But if any of you ladies want to drop by my house for cocktails, there\\'s plenty of room in my limousine. Come on, everybody.  You\\'re looking so fine, Billy Ray? Thank you very much. If you\\'re gonna vomit, the bathroom\\'s downstairs. No, downstairs, man. Shit! Hey! Hey! That\\'s a Persian rug. It\\'s from Persia. What is this shit here? Hold up! Hey, who\\'s been putting out their Kools on my floor? Who has been putting out their Kools on my floor? Have you people ever heard of coasters? Would you like me to prepare some more hors d\\'oeuvres for the guests, sir? Fuck them. Coleman, there was more people in this room before, where \\'d they go? I believe some of them have adjourned upstairs, sir. To my bedroom? I\\'m waiting for you, Billy Ray. Put your clothes on and get out. Yeah, that\\'s my girl, over there. Can I have everybody\\'s attention please? Get the fuck out! Good night, sir. Good night, madam. I hope you enjoyed it. Thank you. It was a stone groove, my man. You are the most righteous Get the fuck out, man. Let\\'s go, come on. Hurry up. And be quiet out there. My neighbours are asleep, they work too. Well, your Your friends seemed to enjoy it, I thought it was a great success. They weren\\'t friends. They\\'re a bunch of freeloaders, treating my house like a zoo. Why don\\'t you retire, sir? I\\'ll straighten up. You\\'ve got a big day tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, I think I will retire. Good night, Coleman. Thanks, man. Good night, sir. Let\\'s go, Winthorpe.  Excuse me? I\\'ll see you later, we\\'ll have lunch. How would you like to make a fast hundred? I just got out. Are you trying to entrap me right here? You guys must be getting desperate. Is that your purse? Yes. That\\'s a nice purse. Thank you. Darling, I\\'m so glad to see you. Louis, you\\'re making a scene. The good news is I\\'m innocent. I\\'ve never done anything resembling this. Louis, you look awful. I\\'m so ashamed. Those clothes and those shoes and you\\'ve been fighting, and you smell. I smell? Penelope, do you realise where I\\'ve been since yesterday? They beat me up and stole my clothes. Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Can we discuss this somewhere else? They tried to bend me over this If this place is indicative of correctional institutions in this country, they might as well let all the convicts out. It\\'s far worse on the inside. Stealing from your friends, Louis? Heroin, Louis? Have you lost your mind? Mother wants me to call off the wedding and so does Todd. Todd, what does Todd have to do with it? You\\'ve been fired from Duke & Duke. They\\'re charging you with embezzlement. Embezzlement? I\\'ve never stolen anything in my life. How could the man I loved, whose children I wanted to have and breast-feed, be a heroin dealer? It wasn\\'t heroin, it was angel dust, PCP Listen Penelope, I swear to you, on my honour, with almighty God as my witness, I am not an angel dust dealer. Oh, Louis. I\\'ve been looking everywhere for you, baby.  Louis, I\\'m hurting. I just need a shot? Would you please  Who is this person? I\\'ve never seen this woman before. Don\\'t say that, Louis. Come on baby, just a dime bag. I\\'ll do all those things you like. You lying filthy disgusting creep. Todd was right about you. I never want to see you again as long as I live. Grand! Great! Thanks a lot. It was a joke. Your friend said it would get you off.  Someone told you to do this to me? Yeah, and he paid me $100. He\\'s over there. Let me get this straight, I give you  for the cab, and you\\'ll give me  at your house? That is correct. My butler will give you $50, and drive you anywhere you wish. You don\\'t exactly look like the type that has a butler.  If you\\'re hustling meHustling you, hustling you? You don\\'t think they give these to just anyone, do you? I can charge goods and services in over  countries around the world. Yeah? Well I don\\'t take credit cards. You\\'ll see what a mistake all this was. Yes? Coleman, could you let me in? I\\'m having trouble with my key.  Who are you? What do you want? Just let me in, I\\'m in no mood for jokes. Coleman? There\\'s no Coleman here. You\\'ve made a mistake. Excuse me, for a moment. Coleman! Let me in. If you don\\'t go away, I shall call the police. Hello. I\\'ll be making a cash withdrawal for the amount of $500. In fact, make it $1,000. Excuse me. I\\'m sorry, Mr Winthorpe, but the IRS has frozen your accounts. What? You know me. You\\'re a heroin dealer, Mr Winthorpe. It wasn\\'t heroin, it was angel dustPCP and I never touched it. Regardless, it\\'s not the kind of business we want at First National. May I see your credit cards please?  I\\'ve been ordered to repossess them? What? Wait, what am I supposed to live on? What\\'s going to happen to me? Roger. Why is someone deliberately trying to ruin my life? Tell you what. Forget about the $50, OK? I\\'m just real tired. I\\'m going home. You\\'ve got to believe me. You must believe me. I have been framed. You can\\'t just leave me here. I\\'ve got enough problems, Louis. Come on, come on. Listen! Wait! Wait. I have over $150, in that bank. But you don\\'t care because you helped them do this to me. Get off your knees, Louis. Give me your hand. Soft hands. And a manicure. Never done a hard day\\'s work in your life, have you? I\\'m gonna regret this but come on. Get in. I\\'m going to get to the bottom of this. This has been a grave mistake. Hey, that looks just like the dude that had me busted. Sir? Right there, he looked just like the mother I mean, he looks just like the gentleman that had me busted. To whom are you referring, sir? The dude right there.  Right over there? That\\'s my car. Coleman! Coleman, that\\'s my car! That\\'s my car! That\\'s my driver. There\\'s some strange shit going on here, Coleman. You don\\'t want to be late for your first day, sir. What do they want me to do here?  I\\'m sure they\\'ll tell you? What if I can\\'t do it? Just be yourself, sir. Whatever happens, they can\\'t take that away from you.  Excuse me, my name isMr Valentine. They\\'re waiting in the last office down the hall.  Ah, William, my boy. Right on time? Come in, come in. Sit down. No thanks, guys. I already had breakfast. This is not a meal, Valentine. We are here to try to explain to you, what it is we do here. We are commodities brokers, William. Now, what are commodities? Commodities are agricultural products. Like coffee, that you had for breakfast. Wheat, which is used to make bread. Pork bellies, which is used to make bacon, which you might find in a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich. Then there are other commodities like frozen orange juice and gold. Though, of course, gold doesn\\'t grow on trees like oranges.  Clear so far? Yeah. Good, William. Now, some of our clients are speculating that the price of gold will rise in the future. We have other clients who are speculating that the price of gold is going to fall. They\\'ve placed their orders with us and we buy or sell their gold for them. Tell him the good part. The good part is that no matter whether our clients make money, or lose money, Duke & Duke get the commissions. Well, what do you think, Valentine? Sounds to me like you guys are a couple of bookies. I told you he\\'d understand. It doesn\\'t take a genius to figure out what happened. It\\'s the same guy who tried to rob the payroll, no doubt, that\\'s him. He planted the drugs on me. Rachim, Mohammed, Larry. How are you guys doing? Hey, hey, how ya doing? You know those people? He was wearing my Harvard tie. Can you believe it? My Harvard tie. Like, oh sure, he went to Harvard. If he\\'s being driven around in my car, he could actually be living in my house. Maybe he\\'s even taken my job. For all I know, right at this moment he could be fondling my fiancÃ©e. And Colemanafter years of service, this betrayal. I don\\'t understand it. There\\'s going to be retribution. Oh, he\\'s going to pay.  The things that IShut up, Louis. Taxis cost money, food costs money and rent costs money! Now, you want me to help you out, I expect a lot in return. These were here when I moved in. Put \\'em on if you want. Look, I cannot begin to tell you how much I appreciate this  Ophelia? Ophelia, you realise that\\'s the name I know, Hamlet\\'s girlfriend. He went crazy, she killed herself. This is not Shakespeare, Louis. I\\'m 24. I\\'m from a small, miserable mining town you probably never heard of. The only thing I\\'ve got going for me, is this body, this face, and what I got up here. I don\\'t do drugs. And I don\\'t have a pimp. This place is a dump. But it\\'s cheap, it\\'s clean and it\\'s all mine. I\\'ve saved  grand and it\\'s in T-Bills earning interest. I\\'ve got three more years on my back. I\\'ll have enough to retire. You\\'re a prostitute? I\\'m talking about a business proposition, Louis. I help you get back on your feet and you pay me, in cash, five figures. That\\'s the deal and it\\'s not subject to negotiation. Understood? By the way, food and rent are not the only things here that cost money. You sleep on the couch. It\\'s hit rock bottom. Come on, let\\'s buy. Buy  May belly contracts at 66.8.  Put them on my personal account? That\\'s a big mistake, man.  Valentine, this is very important, watch? You\\'re going to get reamed on this one. Why shouldn\\'t we buy now, William? Price is going to keep going down. Randolph, this isn\\'t Monopoly money we\\'re playing with. This is Randolph Duke. Hold that belly over a moment. Tell me why you think the price of pork bellies is going down.  It\\'s Christmas time. Everybody\\'s uptight? Could we please buy now?  If you want to lose money go ahead? What are you trying to say? OK, pork belly prices have been dropping all morning. So everybody\\'s waiting for them to hit rock bottom so they can buy cheap. The people with pork belly contracts are thinking, \"Hey, we\\'re losing all our money and Christmas is coming.\" \"I won\\'t be able to buy my son the GI Joe with the Kung Fu grip.\" \"And my wife won\\'t make love to me cos I ain\\'t got no money.\" They\\'re panicking, screaming, \"Sell, sell.\" They don\\'t want to lose all their money. They are panicking right now. I can feel it. Look at them. He\\'s right, Mortimer, my God, look at it. I\\'d wait till you get to 64, then buy. You\\'ll have cleared out all the suckers by then. Do you realise how much money he just saved us? Money isn\\'t everything, Randolph. Advise our clients interested in bellies to buy at 64. Mr Valentine has set the price. Well done, William. Very well done. Come on, Randolph, we\\'re gonna be late. Yo Mortimer dropped his money clip.  You can count it, it\\'s all there? Thank you.  It\\'s all there, count it? I\\'m sure it is. Keep up the good work. All right, Randy. Nice try, Mortimer. That was great, that was really great. and she stepped on the ball. Oh my God, I don\\'t believe it.  Ah, there you are? I think I\\'m going to be sick. Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll handle this, Pookums. Todd, Harry, Andrew, Philip. I realise this looks completely awful but I just wanted to assure you, my friends, that I am completely innocent. I\\'m going to fight this. Someone is out to get me and I know who. The important thing is that I can rely on you, my friends, as character witnesses. I\\'m going to be defending myself and I wondered if you could see your way clear to perhaps advance me a small loan until the hearing. Frankly, Winthorpe, and I think I speak for all of us, I think it shows incredibly bad taste for you to embarrass us like this. I believe I\\'m still a member of this club. Nobody wants to buy your drugs, Louis. Why don\\'t you just go away? Burnt my fingers, man. I beg your pardon. Man, that watch is so hot, it\\'s smokin\\'. Hot? Do you mean to imply, stolen?  I\\'ll give you  bucks for it. bucks! No, no, no. This is a Rochefoucauld, the thinnest water-resistant watch in the world. Singularly unique, sculptured in design, hand-crafted in Switzerland and water-resistant to three atmospheres. This is the sports watch of the \\'s. $6, retail. Got a receipt? Look, it tells time simultaneously in Monte Carlo, Beverly Hills, London, Paris, Rome and Gstaad. In Philadelphia it\\'s worth  bucks. Just give me the money. How much for the gun? So, this snail is standing in front of the Cadillac salesman, see, and says, \"How much is that Cadillac?\" The snail says, \"I want a big \\'S\\' put on each door\" \"and on top of the car, I want a big \\'S\\' so everybody can see it.\" Salesman says, \"Why do you want that?\" He says, \"When I drive down the avenue \"I want everybody to say \\'Look at that S-car-go.\"\\' \"Look at the S-car-go.\" I\\'m considering going long on April wheat. What do you think, Valentine? I can think of three good reasons why you shouldn\\'t do that, judge. One, the Russian wheat harvest isn\\'t going to be as bad as people think and two and three, judging by the jewels around your girlfriend\\'s neck, I think you\\'re going to need every penny just to keep her happy. 2103. That\\'s it, you\\'re staying in bed. That man has moved into my house. He\\'s stolen my job. I have to do something. Stay here. It\\'s ten o\\'clockhere\\'s Johnny. Listen, baby, I\\'m sorry. My momma just came in from outta town. Can we do it next week? Flowers for me? Thanks.  What are you doing? You\\'ve got company. Business is business. I\\'ll go for a walk.  Fresh air will do me good? Lay down. I\\'m sorry you had to cancel your appointment. What are you doing? Ophelia, I can\\'t tell you how good that feels. You\\'ve been so kind to me. I\\'m just protecting my investment. That\\'s all. Shut up and go to sleep.  and a half. You\\'re not getting out of bed until it\\'s normal. I feel fine and I\\'ve inconvenienced you enough. You have work to do and so do I. Nobody works on Christmas Eve. I\\'m going shopping and then I\\'ll make you a nice quiet dinner. Now, read your paper. Christmas! I\\'ll give him a Christmas present he\\'ll never forget. Ah William, where\\'ve you been? The party\\'s already begun. I have some work to finish. It\\'s Christmas Eve and William wants to keep working. I\\'ll think of you in Stockholm, when I accept the Nobel Prize. The wager has two partssomething about a second party turning to crime. Didn\\'t you say you had work to do? Yes sir. I was wondering about this $10, cheque to Mr Clarence Beeks. I\\'ll take care of it, Valentine. I don\\'t recall a Clarence Beeks, Mr Duke. It was before you joined us, Valentine. We did manage to stay in business for  years before your arrival. Have a drink, William. Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas, Mr Duke? What?  Merry Christmas? Oh, oh, Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho! Just what do you think you\\'re doing? Randolph, Mortimer, come in here quickly, I\\'ve finally caught him.  Who are you? I\\'ve caught him red-handed. Winthorpe, is that you? I\\'m making a citizen\\'s arrest. This man is a drug dealer. Look, his office drawer, he\\'s got all the bad drugs here. Marijuana joints, pills, Quaaludes, Valium, yellow ones, red ones, cocaine grinder, drug needles. He\\'s the pusher, not me. I just came in and caught him planting this stuff. It\\'s obviously some primitive attempt to frame me. Frame you? Boy, if that isn\\'t the pot calling the kettle black. This man\\'s obviously a lunatic. I\\'m calling security. Put that phone down. Hello, security Merry Christmas. You tried to rob me, plant drugs on me. You steal my house, my car, my job. I ought to kill him now. Look, this is a big misunderstanding. I don\\'t know nothing about it. Could you put the gun away? Put that gun away at once, Winthorpe. Have you lost your mind? Freeze, slime ball. I realise this whole experience must have been rather unsettling for you. Winthorpe, don\\'t leave. We can explain. Yeah, you\\'ll be sorry. You\\'ll all be very, very sorry. Poor, deluded creature. We caught him pilfering at our club, embezzling funds, selling drugs. Now he\\'s dressing up like Santa Claus. Very sordid business. I can\\'t believe Winthorpe would fall to pieces like that. It\\'s not my business, but he belongs behind bars.  He\\'s unemployed, Valentine? It\\'s no excuse, Mortimer. He\\'s flat broke, obviously hungry. But he has money to buy drugs, right? You can\\'t be soft on people like that. Take it from me, Randolph. Pay up, Mortimer, I\\'ve won the bet. Here, one dollar. We took a perfectly useless psychopath, like Valentine, and turned him into a successful executive. And during the same time, we turned an honest, hard-working man into a violently deranged, would-be killer. Now, what are we going to do about taking Winthorpe back and returning Valentine to the ghetto? I don\\'t want Winthorpe back after what he\\'s done. You mean keep Valentine on, as Managing Director? Do you really believe I would have a nigger run our family business, Randolph? Of course not. Neither would I. I do think we should hold off on switching them back, though. Until we get that crop report, New Year\\'s Eve, don\\'t you? Absolutely, no sense rocking the boat until then. If Mr Beeks does what we paid him to do, we should have a very happy New Year. Indeed. Hey, Winthorpe, Winthorpe. Hey. Hey, Winthorpe. Yo, Winthorpe. Winthorpe. Yo. Sorry about that. Yo! Yo! Hey, Taxi! Hi, Louis. Merry Christmas. Louis, I have a big surprise for you. Excuse me. The door was open I\\'m looking for a Louis Winthorpe.  Does he live here? Wait here a minute, I\\'ll be right back. Louis, Louis. It\\'s him. It\\'s Valentine. Louis Louis? Louis. It was close but he\\'s going to be all right. Now, make sure he gets plenty of rest. And for God\\'s sake, no excitement. Thanks, Doc. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. I\\'ll let myself out, Coleman. Thank you.  Merry Christmas? Merry Christmas. It was a dream. I dreamt the whole thing. It was just a bad dream. Good morning, sir. Merry Christmas. Coleman, I\\'ve had the most absurd nightmare. I was poor and no one liked me. I lost my job, I lost my house. Penelope hated me. And it was all because of this terrible, awful Negro.  Oh dear!Lt was the Dukes. You\\'re a dead man, Valentine. It was an experiment. They used us as guinea pigs, man. The Dukes used us as guinea pigs. To see how our lives would turn out. They made a bet.  I\\'m afraid it\\'s true, sir? I believe him, Louis. The Dukes ruined my life over a bet?  For how much? A dollar. One dollar. Fine, that\\'s the way they want it. No problem. You can\\'t just shoot people with a double-barrelled shotgun cos you\\'re pissed at them.  Why not? It\\'s assault with a deadly weapon. You get  years for that shit. Do you have any better ideas? Yeah, it seems the best way to hurt rich people is by turning \\'em into poor people. You have to admit, you didn\\'t like it yourself a bit. Under heavy security, the crop estimates for next year\\'s orange crop are being delivered to the Department Of Agriculture in Washington DC. Louis, Louis, that\\'s him, the guy who paid me to talk dirty to you. In charge of security, Mr Clarence Beeks of Lyndhurst Security. Clarence Beeks.  The Dukes gave him  grand? I saw 50, in the payroll. Mortimer said it was for research. Research, so he can get that top secret report, two days before it goes public. Oh my God, the Dukes will corner the entire frozen orange juice market. Unless somebody stops them. Or beats them to it. Eggnog? Duke & Duke, may I ask who\\'s calling? Duke & Duke, he\\'s busy. Can you hold please? May I help you? One moment, Mr Beeks, I\\'ll put you right through. Operation \"strange fruit\" proceeding according to plan. I anticipate penetration and acquisition at 21: tomorrow. Hold on. Fuck off!  When can we expect delivery? I will be leaving DC by train. Will rendezvous at 24: at the Hilton Hotel, parking level D, Section 4. That\\'s the orange section. Orange, I like that, very good. The final payment is due on delivery, in cash. Jesus, hey! Happy New Year!  Ever make it with an ape? Harvey, haven\\'t you had enough drink? Are you kidding, it\\'s not even New Year\\'s Eve. Come here, kiss this beautiful ape. Come on. Harrisburg Express  What? It\\'s my turn to drive.  No it isn\\'t? Lt is.  I\\'m sure you think it is, but it isn\\'t? Don\\'t you remember? You drove the shipment of anchovies. Yeah, but you had the video tape recorders this afternoon. I backed them up about five feet. We take turns. Sometimes it\\'s longer, sometimes shorter. It\\'s my turn now.  No it isn\\'t? Yes it is.  Merry New Year? Happy New Year. In this country, we say, \"Happy New Year\". Thank you for correcting my English, which stinks. I am Naga Eboko, exchange student from Cameroon. Beef jerky time.  You want some beef jerky? No, please. There\\'s plenty, you know. This animal\\'s being routed through to New York. Its care and feeding instructions are on this bill of lading. OK, gotcha. I doubt you\\'ll have need it but, there\\'s a tranquilliser gun in the First Aid kit.  Oh, yeah? Say, have you guys been drinking?  No, sir. Not us? There\\'s enough drunks here already. Happy New Year. That\\'s kind of you, son. A Happy New Year to you, too. Could I offer either of you two gentlemen a wee jolt of Irish whisky, to usher in the New Year. Not for me, pal. I do not drink. Lt is against my religion. I always say, religion\\'s a fine thing, taken in moderation. Beef jerky? No son, it gives me wind, something terrible. We are moving! We are moving! New York, here we come! Come in, my child, join the party. Let me see, you would be from Austria. Am I right?  No, I am Inga from Sweden? Sweden? But you\\'re wearing Lederhosen. Ja, for sure, from Sweden. Please, help me with my rucksack. Oh yeah, sure, why not? I\\'m hungry, man. I\\'ve got to get something more to eat. Well, maybe there\\'s some pretzels in the bar car. You\\'re welcome!  Who is that? Open the door, man. I\\'m dressed as a baggage handler. Imagine how embarrassed I was that someone had the same costume I had! Monkey, monkey? I\\'m a fucking gorilla you clown! I certainly hope there\\'s enough space on the train for me. Naga, Naga Eboko, from Cameroon. Do you remember me? It\\'s Lionel Joseph. Lionel, from the African Education Conference, right? I was Director of Cultural Events at the Haile Selassie Pavilion. I remember we have big fun there. Now we are all here, we will have a picnic, ja? You will help me get my rucksack down for the Swedish meatballs.  Remember the one we did? Yeah.  The memories? All day long I could tell those stories.  Those were good ones? The good old days. There you are, sweet pea? Danke. So, the train will be pulling into Philadelphia soon. Will you be getting off at the city of brotherly love? I will but you won\\'t Winthorpe.  See if this one\\'s empty? Hey, back off. I\\'ll rip out your eyes and piss on your brain.  Excuse me? You got it. All right. On your feet. Up! Let\\'s go. Bunch of fucking weirdos! We\\'re going to take a little walk. Don\\'t try anything funny or the whore loses a kidney.  No, I\\'m from Sweden? Beat it. Hey, I\\'m King Kong, the biggest, baddest guy in the jungle. Get lost, you maggot. Hey, who is that guy, your father or something? All right, hold it right here.  Honestly, Beeks? This is as far as we go. No more cockamamie cigar smoke. No more Swedish meatballs there, tootsie. And no more phoney Irish whisky. No more goddamn jerky beef. The party\\'s over. The party\\'s over. Hey, come on. What do you mean, \"The party\\'s over\"? It\\'s not even ten o\\'clock, you dummy. Hey, come on. Loosen up, man. It\\'s almost New Year\\'s Eve. Hey, look what happened to me! Sometimes, they look so human, it gives you the creeps. Boy, that other one\\'s getting kinda horny, ain\\'t he? Think we ought to hit him up with the tranquilliser gun? It\\'s New Year\\'s. Let \\'em have their fun. That black one must be the female.  Where is he? Beeks. Are you there, Beeks? I\\'m over here. That\\'s far enough. Did you get the report? Let\\'s see the money. OK, toss it over. Thank you, Beeks. Wonderful news. Wonderful. Beeks, Happy New Year. My life savings. Try not to lose it. Lose it? In a couple of hours, you\\'re going to be the richest butler that ever lived. I worked real hard for this, Louis. Hope you know what you\\'re doing.  Thank you, Ophelia? What are you doing? 910: That\\'s us, Louis. Coleman, would you please. Thank you. I could use a stiff drink. Would you care to join me?  Morning, Mr Duke? Wilson.  Good morning, Mr Duke? Wilson. Keep the change. Think big, think positive. Never show any sign of weakness. Always go for the throat. Buy low, sell high. Fear, that\\'s the other guy\\'s problem. Nothing can prepare you for the unbridled carnage you are about to witness. The Super Bowl, the World Series. Pressure? Here it\\'s kill or be killed. Make no friends and take no prisoners. One minute you\\'re up half a million, the next, boom. Your kids don\\'t go to college and you\\'ve lost your Bentley. We\\'ve got to kill the motherfucker We\\'ve got to kill them. We want you to buy as much OJ as you can, the instant trading starts. Don\\'t worry if the price starts going up, just keep buying. They\\'ll broadcast the crop report in an hour, what if Let us worry about that, Wilson. Yes, sir.  How\\'s the ulcer, Harry? Pretty good. How\\'s the hypertension? Hasn\\'t bothered me in months. Let\\'s kick some ass. This is it. The last bastion of pure capitalism left on earth. Here in New York they trade everything, gold, silver, platinum, heating oil, propane, cocoa and sugar and, of course, frozen, concentrated orange juice. The people on the phones are taking orders from brokers all over the world. The runners hand those orders to the traders in the pits. They\\'re trading cotton over there. And that\\'s the silver pit. The Dukes\\' trader is going to be buying like crazy right from the opening. We wait until he drives the price up? Right. I can\\'t wait to see his face, when they broadcast that genuine crop report. OJ trading opens at 9:00.  Let\\'s go kick some butt? Let\\'s go. Hey, hey. The Dukes are trying to corner the market.  They know something? Let\\'s get in on it. 03200, taken.  130.200, 200. Louis. Not yet, almost.   taken.209.  Yeah, yeah, got \\'em.139. Now! Sell,  April at 142. That\\'s not right. How can the price be going down? Something\\'s wrong. Where\\'s Wilson? What are they doing here?  They\\'re selling, Mortimer? Why, that\\'s ridiculous.  Unless that crop reportGod help us. I told you we shouldn\\'t have committed everything, you asshole. We\\'ve got to get Wilson and tell him to sell. Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary Of Agriculture. Ladies and gentlemen, the orange crop estimates for the next year. After calculating the estimates from various orange producing states, We have concluded the following The cold winter has apparently not effected the orange harvest. consumers can expect orange juice prices to fall Wilson, for Christ\\'s sake, sell. Buy \\'em. Wilson, where are you going? You idiot. Get back in there at once and sell, sell.  Five? Yeah, 200.  100.Yeah, that was 100. Did you get that? Happy New Year.  Winthorpe? Valentine.  How\\'d you make out today? How could you do this to us, after everything we\\'ve done for you? Oh, see I made Louis a bet here. Louis bet me that we couldn\\'t get rich and put you in the poorhouse. He didn\\'t think we could do it. I won. I lost.  One dollar? Thank you, Louis.  After you? Certainly. Margin call, gentlemen.  Why you can\\'t expectYou know the rules. All accounts to be settled at the end of the day\\'s trading, without exception. You know perfectly well, we don\\'t have $ million in cash. I\\'m sorry, boys. Put the Duke brothers\\' seats on the exchange up for sale at once. Seize all assets of Duke & Duke Commodity Brokers, as well as all personal holdings of Randolph and Mortimer Duke. We\\'re ruined! This is an outrage, I demand an investigation. You can\\'t sell our seats. A Duke has been on this exchange since it was founded. We founded this exchange. It\\'s ours. It belongs to us. We\\'d better call your brother an ambulance. Fuck him! I want trading reopened, right now. Get those brokers back in here. Turn those machines back on. Turn those machines back on. You and your Nobel Prize, you idiot. Where\\'s Beeks? Where in hell is Beeks?  Beeks!Yeah, I forgot all about that guy. OK, one male gorilla. Wait a minute. There\\'s two of them in that cage. One gorilla, two gorillas. Big deal. Whole bunch is getting sent back to Africa. It\\'s a big scientific experiment. What do I know? Anyway, they\\'re in love.  Hey, Coleman? Yes. What about lunch? The lobster or the cracked crab?  What do you think? Can\\'t we have both? Why not?  Dimitri? Sir.  Lobster and cracked crab for everyone? Extra prima good, Mr Coleman, sir. Looking good, Billy Ray.

Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon? Well, Hector, here's the game plan. You're gonna bring us two Absolut martinis. You know how I like them. Straight up. And then precisely seven and one half minutes after that, you're gonna bring us two more. Then two more after that every five minutes until one of us passes the fuck out. Excellent strategy, sir. I'm good with water for now. Thank you. It's his first day on Wall Street. Give him time.  Thank you? Thank you. Mr. Hanna? You're able to do drugs during the day and then still function, still do your job? How the fuck else would you do this job? Cocaine and hookers, my friend. Right. Well, I got to say, I'm incredibly excited to be a part of your firm. I mean The clients you have are absolutely Fuck the clients. Your only responsibility is to put meat on the table. You got a girlfriend? I'm married. I have a wife. Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.  Congratulations? Thank you. Think about Teresa. Name of the game. Move the money from your client's pocket into your pocket. Right. But if you make your clients money at the same time, it's advantageous to everyone. Correct? No. Number one rule of Wall Street. Nobody I don't care if you're Warren Buffett or if you're Jimmy Buffett. Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up, down, sideways, or in fucking circles. Least of all stockbrokers, right? It's all a fugazi. You know what a fugazi is? Fugayzi. It's a fake. Fugayzi, fugazi, it's a whazy, it's a woozy, it's Fairy dust. It doesn't exist. It's never landed. It is no matter. It's not on the elemental chart. It's not fucking real.  Right? Right. Stay with me. We don't create shit. We don't build anything. No. So if you got a client who bought stock at eight and it now sits at 16, he's all fucking happy. He wants to cash in, liquidate, take his fucking money and run home.  You don't let him do that? Okay.  'Cause that would make it real? Right. No. What do you do? You get another brilliant idea. A special idea. Another situation. Another stock to reinvest his earnings and then some. And he will, every single time. 9'Cause they're fucking addicted. And you just keep doing this, again and again and again. Meanwhile, he thinks he's getting shit rich, which he is, on paper. But you and me, the brokers, we're taking home cold hard cash via commission, motherfucker. Right. That's incredible, sir. I can't tell you how excited I am. You should be. There's two keys to success in the broker business. First of all  You gotta stay relaxed? Yeah. Do you jerk off? Do I Do I jerk off? Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah. How many times a week? Like three or four.  Three or four times, maybe five? Gotta pump those numbers up. Those are rookie numbers in this racket. I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day. Once in the morning right after I work out, then once right after lunch. Really? I want to. That's not why I do it. I do it 'cause I fucking need to. Think about it. You're dealing with numbers. All day long, decimal points, high frequencies. Bang, bang, bang. Fucking digits. All very acidic above-the-shoulders mustard shit. All right? It kind of wigs some people out. Right. You got to feed the geese to keep the blood flowing. I keep the rhythm below the belt. Done. This is not a tip, this is a prescription. Trust me. If you don't, you will fall out of balance, split your differential and tip the fuck over. Or worse yet, I've seen this happen, implode. No, I don't want to implode, sir. No. No, you don't. I'm in it for the long run, you know?  Implosions are ugly? Yeah. Pop off to the bathroom, work one out any time you can. When you get really good at it, you'll fucking be stroking it and you'll be thinking about money. Second key to success in this racket is this little baby right here. It's called cocaine. Right. It'll keep you sharp between the ears. It'll also help your fingers dial faster. And guess what? That's good for me. Yes, sir. Revolutions. You follow? Revolutions. Keep the clients on the Ferris wheel. And it goes. The park is open 24/7, 365, every decade, every goddamn century. That's it. The name of the game. Halkidiki? Thank you. Come on. We're the common denominator. Keep it up for me. You've seen the echo And the money comes in The parade comes to town Going down Broadway It's a one-way street Whichever way I go The next six months, I got to know the ins and outs of Wall Street.

Penny stocks? Yeah. This one, Aerodyne, is a really interesting or Aerotyne Aerotyne, yeah. Aero Aerotyne Aerotyne. Yeah. Very hot stock right now. Oh, yeah? They're just a couple of brothers that are making radar detectors out of their garage. They're out in Dubuque. Maybe it's microwaves. I'm not sure. But you call the company's main line, their mom, Dorothy, answers and she is so sweet.  Good company? I actually don't know what else to I don't know anything else about them other than that. Six cents a share? Hey, come on. Who buys this crap? Well, I mean Honestly, mostly schmucks. Postmen, there's always postmen. Plumbers. They see our ads in the back of Hustler and Popular Mechanics.

Or I did make one percent. Pink sheets, it's 50. It's 50%? 050% commission?  Yup? For what? It's our markup for our services. And so if I if I if I sell a stock at $10,000, my commission is 5, bucks? If you sell $10, worth of this stock, I will personally give you a blowjob for free. And I hope it happens. Hello, John, how are you doing today? You mailed in my company a postcard a few weeks back requesting information on penny stocks that had huge upside potential with very little downside risk.  Does that ring a bell? Yeah, I may have sent something. Okay, great. The reason for the call today, John, is something just came across my desk, John. It is perhaps the best thing I've seen in the last six months. If you have  seconds, I'd like to share the idea with you. You got a minute? Actually, I'm really very The name of the company, Aerotyne International. It is a cutting edge high-tech firm out of the Midwest awaiting imminent patent approval on the next generation of radar detectors that have both huge military and civilian applications now. Right now, John, the stock trades over-the-counter at  cents a share. And by the way, John, our analysts indicate it could go a heck of a lot higher than that. Your profit on a mere $6, investment would be upwards of $60,000! Jesus! That's my mortgage, man. Exactly. You could pay off your mortgage. This stock will pay off my house? John, one thing I can promise you, even in this market, is that I never ask my clients to judge me on my winners. I ask them to judge me on my losers because I have so few. And in the case of Aerotyne, based on every technical factor out there, John, we are looking at a grand slam home run. Okay, let's do it. I'll do four grand. 4,000? That'd be 40, shares, John. Let me lock in that trade right now and get back to you with my secretary with an exact confirmation. Sound good, John?  Yeah, sounds good? Great. Hey, John. Thank you for your vote of confidence. And welcome to the Investor's Center. Yeah, thanks a lot, man. Bye-bye. How'd you fucking do that? Just like that, I made two grand. The other guys looked at me like I'd just discovered fire. Great! Even better! I was selling garbage to garbage men and making cash hand over fist. The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't buy more. So I was selling them shit. But the way I looked at it, their money was better off in my pocket. I knew how to spend it better. Excuse me. Is that your car in the lot? Yeah.  It's a nice ride? Thanks, man. Donnie Azoff. Hey.

Like his phosphorescent white teeth. Wife! I gotta fucking deal with your wife? The fact that he wore horn rims with clear lenses just to look more WASP-y. And then, there were these rumors. I heard some stupid shit. I don't know. Fuck, I didn't even want to bring it up. It's just  It's stupid? Shit with me? You know, people say shit. I don't even know.

Go, go, go, go! You've reached Frank's Best Auto Body. We're closed right now. So please leave us a message. Hello. My name is Jordan Belfort. My partner and I are very interested in renting out your garage. Donnie and I were going out on our own. And the first thing we needed was brokers. Guys with sales experience. So I recruited some of my hometown boys. Sea Otter, who sold meat and weed. Chester, who sold tires and weed. And Robbie, who sold anything he could get his hands on. Mostly weed. Can you bring me some ketchup? Okay? This is Brad. And Brad's the guy I really wanted. But he didn't go along with us. He was already making so much money selling Quaaludes, he'd become the Quaalude king of Bayside. Getting any pussy with that thing or what? Yeah, man, of course. Bring some of them chicks around here sometime, huh? Let 'em watch. Let 'em watch. Know what I mean? Hey, Zip! You tell your sister I was asking about her. Why don't you bring me a pair of her panties next time you come through. Yeah, man. She said she don't want to talk to you anymore, man. Get the fuck out of here. Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what? Ma! You listening? It's easier than you think. Every person you're on the phone with, they want to get rich and they want to get rich quickly. They all want something for nothing. There was this one time that I was selling pot to this Amish dude. You know those guys who got like the beard with like no mustache or some bullshit? Well, he says that he only wants to make furniture. I don't understand. What's that got to do with anything? What the fuck are you talking about? I'm not putting words in your mouth or nothing, but you just said that everybody wants to get rich. Holy fuck, you did just say that. What the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, like Buddhists. They don't give a shit about money. They're wrapped in sheets. They're not buying shit. I'm not talking about Buddhists or Amish. I'm talking about normal people, working-class, everyday people. Everyone wants to get rich. Am I crazy? There's no such thing as an Amish Buddhist.  I'm pretty fucking sure? There could be. Can we get some ketchup, please? Do you guys not want to make money? I want to make some money. I want to make some fucking money, okay. I can sell anything. Shit, I can sell ludes to a convent full of nuns, and get them so horny they'd be fucking each other. That's the attitude. You can sell anything? Sell me this fucking pen right here. You can sell anything. Sell that. Go ahead. Sell me the pen. Can I finish eating first? I haven't eaten today. Brad, show them how it's done. Boom. Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on. You want me to sell this fucking pen? That's my boy right there. Can fucking sell anything. Why don't you do me a favor. Write your name down on that napkin for me. I don't have a pen. Exactly. Supply and demand, my friend.  Holy shit? See what I'm saying? He's creating urgency. Get them to want to buy the stock. Convince them it's something they need, you know what I mean? And that's the thing. All nuns are lesbians. What the fuck are you talking about, Otter? Think about it. They can't keep a dude so they're gonna start fucking chicks. Four fucking times, Kimmie! Four times.  He's not with us? Friggin' Rambo. Now she runs. But look, I knew these guys weren't like Harvard MBAs. Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead, took five years to finish high school. Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter, didn't even graduate. Chester Ming, the depraved Chinaman, thought jujitsu was in Israel. Smartest of the bunch was Nicky Koskoff. He actually went to law school. I called him Rugrat because of his piece of shit hairpiece. Still, give them to me young, hungry and stupid and in no time, I'll make them rich. Oh, my God. Jordan, that You like it, baby? Oh, my God, it's beautiful. They're not the biggest stones in the world, but I promise they're really high quality. It's beautiful. They're so beautiful. Oh, boy. What? I know that look. What is it? Go ahead. I don't know, it's, you know These stocks, these companies They're like crappy companies.  Well, yeah? Okay. Yeah, they're terrible. Don't worry about it. I told you, what I'm doing is completely legal. Yeah, I know. But they're not gonna make anyone money though, right? Well, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. You know how it goes. Wouldn't you feel better if you sold that stuff to rich people who can, like, afford to lose all that money? Of course. But rich people don't buy penny stocks. They just don't. Why not? Because they're too smart, that's why not. I mean, what person with a college education would trust this bunch of jerk-offs? Hang up the phone. Tell him you'll call him back. I got five fucking grand on the phone right now! Hey! But what if they didn't sound like a bunch of jerk-offs? What if I could teach them how to sell to people with money? Real money. So I decided to reinvent the company. Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton Oakmont. You schnooks will now be targeting the wealthiest 1% of Americans. We're talking about whales here. Moby fucking Dicks. And with this script, which is now your new harpoon, I'm gonna teach each and every one of you to be Captain fucking Ahab. Get it? Captain who? Captain Ahab. From the fucking The book, motherfucker. From the book. Turn your fucking brain on.  Fuck you? Jesus fuck, Robbie. Listen to me. We're a new company with a new name. A company that our clients can believe in. A company that our clients can trust. A firm whose roots are so deeply embedded into Wall Street that our very founders sailed over on the Mayflower and chiseled the name Stratton Oakmont right into Plymouth fucking Rock! You got it? What we're gonna do is this. First we pitch 'em Disney, AT&T, IBM, blue chip stocks exclusively. Companies these people know. Once we've suckered them in, we unload the dog shit. The pink sheets, the penny stocks, where we make the money. 550% commission, baby. Now the key to making money in a situation like this is to position yourself now before the settlement. Because by the time you read about it in The Wall Street Journal, it's already too late. Then you wait. You wait. And whoever speaks first loses. Sorry I appreciate the call. I really have to give this some thought and talk to my wife about it. Can I call you back? They don't know, right? They gotta think about it, they gotta talk to their fucking wives, or the fucking Tooth Fairy. Point is, it doesn't matter what the fuck they say. The only real objection that they have is that they don't trust you guys. And why should they trust you? I mean, look at you. You're a bunch of fucking sleazy salesmen, right? So, what do you say? You mean to tell me that if I put you in at Union Carbide at seven and took you out at . Texas Instruments at  and took you out at . U? S. Steel at 16, took you out at . You wouldn't be saying to me right now, Chester, pick me up a few thousand shares of Disney. On the spot, right now. Come on. Honestly, Kevin? Honestly? Seriously? I don't know you. You cold-called me. You're a total stranger. I am in complete agreement with you. You don't know me, I don't know you. Let me introduce myself to you. My name is Alden Kupferberg.  Robbie Feinberg? Chester Ming. I'm Senior Vice President at Stratton Oakmont and I plan on being one of the top brokers in my firm next year. And I'm not gonna get there by being wrong, Stanley. I do wanna say that you sound like a You sound like a pretty sincere guy. It's not gonna make you rich and it's not gonna make you poor. But what this trade will do is serve as a benchmark for future business, Kevin. You feel comfortable with me now, Scotty? And then you'll know for sure that you finally found a broker on Wall Street that you can trust, and who can consistently make you money. Sound fair enough? You know what Yeah. I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed. What are you thinking? Kevin. You give me one shot here on a blue chip stock like Kodak, and believe me, Kevin, the only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't buy more. Sound fair enough? Shit. My My wife might divorce me, but Yeah, let's do it. Excellent choice, Kevin. How much do you want to go for this time? Let's do five $5,000. Can we try 8,000, Kevin? All right. Let's do 10.  Ten? You want to do that? Excellent choice! Kevin, let me lock in that trade right now and get back to you in a few minutes with an exact confirmation, Kevin. And welcome to Stratton Oakmont. Thanks, man. I'm gonna have a beer. This is fun. Take it easy, Kev. Hey, thanks, Jordan. Thanks a Fuck that motherfucker! That's what I'm talking about! What a fucking idiot. The one thing I know about in this world is airlines. And Cuchon Airlines is the future of airlines. Get in now or  I'm Nicky KoskoffChester Ming and I'm a Senior Vice President with Stratton Oakmont. Judy, I am so, so, so sorry for your loss. When did he pass? Just say I'm wrong, right. And the stock goes down a couple points and it makes you, in the words of my grandfather, God rest his soul, a shit ton of money. It's like getting in on fucking sunlight before there was fucking sunlight, you understand? Can we do 8, shares? Okay, 25,000. That's a very intelligent decision. I'm gonna transfer you to my sales associate. Rhonda!  Rhonda!I am gonna put you through to Andrea. Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda? Everybody have a good week? Yeah! The end of the month. 28. million in gross commissions, all from pink sheet stock, boys! And to celebrate with our weekly act of debauchery, I have offered our lovely sales assistant, Danielle Harrison, here, 10, to shave her fucking head! Yeah! Yeah, you want this? You want this? Let's scalp her! Scalp her! Let the scalping begin! Scalp! Scalp! Scalp! FYI, boys, Danielle has promised to use this $10, for breast implants! She's already got C cups, but now she wants fucking double D's! Is this a great fucking company or what? Is this the greatest company in the world? Donnie! Blow the roof off this motherfucker! Champagne? Send in the stripees! Mine! Word about us spread throughout Wall Street. Even the places I didn't want it to. It wasn't long before Forbes magazine, the flagship of Wall Street, called to do a profile on me. Let me ask you, how do you see the future for Stratton Oakmont? One word? Diversification. Sounds good. Thank you so much. I have more than enough.  I appreciate your time? Fantastic. Can we get a quick picture? A total fucking hatchet job. This conniving little twat! Look at this! The Wolf of Wall Street, they call me. Look. Your hair looks good.  Well, my hair looks good? Yeah. Jordan Belfort, sounding like a kind of twisted Robin Hood who takes from the rich and gives to himself and his merry little band of brokers.  Read that. Read it? Listen. There is no such thing as bad publicity, sweetheart. Read the article, babe. Jordan, you look great! You're in a huge magazine. Big fucking deal I look great. Mr. Belfort! Can you look at my resume, please? Excuse me, excuse me, sir! Calm the fuck down! What the hell's all this? It's the Forbes article. They all want to work for you now. Hey! What did I say? I'm just trying to be nice. Hey, you want a job, you talk to me!  Mr. Belfort!Give me one minute. Forbes made me a superstar. Every day, dozens of money-crazed kids beat a path to my door. If we hired 'em, they dropped straight out of college overnight and spent whatever allowance they had on a new suit from our Stratton tailor. Are you fucking serious right now? I mean, we were literally putting clothes on these kids' backs. And here comes this jerk-off sniffing around. But, you know, every time someone rises up in this world, there's always gonna be some asshole trying to drag him down. Within months, we doubled in size, moved to even bigger offices. It was a madhouse. A greed-fest, with equal parts cocaine, testosterone and body fluids. Yes! It got so bad, I had to declare the office a fuck-free zone between the hours of 9: and 7:00. But I'm telling you, even that didn't help. Actually, the madness started on our very first day, when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner, christened the elevator by getting a blowjob from a sales assistant. Her name was Pam, and to her credit, she did have this amazing technique, with this wild twist and jerk motion. About a month later, Donnie and I decided to double-team her on a Saturday afternoon while our wives were out shopping for Christmas dresses. Eventually, Ben married her, which was pretty amazing considering she blew every single guy in the office. Then he got depressed and killed himself three years later. Anyway, I hired my dad, Max, to maintain order as the Enforcer. Stratton's very own Gestapo. We called him Mad Max because of his hair-trigger temper, which could be set off by something as innocuous as a ringing telephone. Who the fuck has the goddamn gall to call this house on a Tuesday night? God damn it! You're gonna miss it! Please, tell me something I don't know. I wait all week for the fucking Equalizer and they have to fucking Hello. But as soon as he picked up the phone Gene. How are you, Gene? He'd affect this weird British accent. Right-o, Gene, that'd be great. Cheerio. It was absolutely bizarre. The fucking halfwit!  He'd hang upYou missed it! And then he's Mad Max all over again. Damn it! All right, tell me what happened. What happened? Well, he discovered it was the mother's sister. Who's he? Who? Tell me who The main guy. You know who the main The main guy It was his mother's sister. She showed up dead. Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know everything we were doing at Stratton. And then there's a big target and we They get launched at the target. They stick. There's a bull's-eye and the bull's-eye's a dollar sign. Whoever gets closer to the dollar sign gets the most points. I'm gonna throw the shit out of this little fucking thing. So if it gets hurt, what happens? 7'Cause we're gonna get fucking nuts. I don't think he's gonna get hurt. They're like They got like superhuman strength. I think he's gonna be fine. You can't look him right in the eyes. You can't look him in the eye? That's a fact. I saw it on PBS. They get confused and their wires get crossed. You gotta look at their chin. Like it looks like I'm looking at you but I'm looking at your chin. I feel like you're addressing me right now, but you're not, are you? They're like the Mona Lisa. They find eye contact, like, wherever you are standing in the room. And they lock in. No, but there is a limit to what we can do with them? We're allowed to throw shit at 'em. We're allowed to throw food? Bananas. Any food. Correct. But, for example, what I wouldn't do is maybe like tell him to pull his cock out and like get some of the girls to, you know, fondle him and shit like that. That would be That's unacceptable? Let's keep that in our back pocket. This guy is more about throwing at the dartboard. Correct. Yes, yes, yes. The thing is, this is their gift, okay. They're built to be thrown like a lawn dart. They're top heavy like a lawn dart. So they're built for accuracy. Oh, my God. Can we bowl with this guy? That's his fucking brother, Rob. His brother's the bowling ball. The brother, you put a skateboard on him, you strap him to a skateboard, you toss him down an alley at some pins.  No shit. That's interesting? Swear to fucking God.  Can we get that guy? Yeah, we'll get that guy too. But it says here this guy will show his cock. Yeah.  Instead of growing up. Yeah? He will? They are very ornery by the way, so you gotta be very careful with these little guys. Safety first. Safety is first, all right? I want somebody with a fucking tranquilizer gun ready to knock this fucker out.  Do we want to get like aMace. Taser guns. A pellet gun maybe? No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him. I just want him out. Knocked out cold. But I say we stick with the loophole. Right? Okay? If we don't consider him a human, we just consider it an act, I think we're in the clear. Like The Flying Wallendas. You know, a lot of those guys died but they never sued anybody. The important thing you guys gotta keep in mind is that these things gossip. They get together and they gossip.  That's a good point? And the last thing that we need is them getting together and saying Oh, they made fun of us. Like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad. That's why I love you. You think of shit like that. When they come in, we treat it just like one of us. Okay? One of us. Gooble gobble, one of us. We accept them, one of us! Gooble gobble, one of us. We accept them, one of us. Gooble gobble, one of us! Jordan! Your dad's coming. Something about the American Express bill. Can you get him out of here? Yeah. Lick my twat. No, I'm serious! Fuck. Guys, act like we're working. You got any fucking stock forms? He's coming, he's coming. Make some shit up. I think if we short Pfizer 0430, in one month, Jordy? Four hundred and fucking 30, fucking dollars in one fucking month! Good morning. They're business expenses. Relax.  Business expenses? Yes.  Jordy, look what you got here? What? Look at this. $26, for one fucking dinner! Okay. No, no. This could be explained. Dad, we had clients. The Pfizer clients. Right. The porterhouse from Argentina. Expensive champagne and We had to buy champagne. And you ordered all the fucking sides.  Tell him about the sides? I ordered sides, so Sides? $26, worth of sides? What are these sides? They cure cancer? The sides did cure cancer. That's the problem. That's why they were expensive.  Shut the fuck up? I'm serious.  Stop? And EJ Entertainment? What the fuck is EJ Entertainment? Well, that's Yeah, Jordy, what's EJ Entertainment? How do I describe this? Jord, what is that?  It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!I know.  That's what it is!That is what it is. Isn't that the perfect description for it? That is what it is. But none of these were charged to me. This is all of them.  Oh, that was all us? It wasn't me though. Fucking explain this shit to him! These are all of your fucking charges right here! The IRS, they allow for T&A. It's fine. T&E! Yeah. I said T&E.  No, no. You said T&A? No, I didn't. Yeah, you did.  When did I say that? You said T&A. It's T&E.

At Stratton, there were three kinds of hookers. The Blue Chips, top of the line, model material. They cost between $ and $ and you had to wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip, which, of course, I always did. Then came the NASDAQs, who were pretty, not great. They cost between  and  bucks. Finally, there were the Pink Sheets. Skanks. They cost about  or less. If you didn't wear a condom, you'd have to get a penicillin shot the next day and pray your dick didn't fall off. Not that we didn't fuck them too. Believe me, we did. It's that slipped disc thing again. I know what it is. You know, too much with EJ Entertainment. Pops. How are things at home? Well, not the best. She just doesn't You know what I'm saying?

You know Your mother and I, we've been married a long, long time. What do you think? We're We're jumping into bed every two minutes?  It doesn't work that way? I love her to death.

All of a sudden, one week, nobody had anything down there anymore. It's a new world. They're bald from the eyebrows down. Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers. A new world. I was born too too early. I've never been a fan of the bush, to be honest.  Really? Yeah. I don't mind it. Dad. I don't want you stressing out about any of this. How can I not get stressed out? Look at the knuckleheads you got working for you. I know they're knuckleheads but I need them to want to live like me, you get it? To live like me. Jordy. One of these days, the chickens are gonna come home to roost. You're looking at me like I'm crazy. Crazy? This is obscene. It was obscene. In the normal world. But who the fuck wanted to live there? Go party your fucking cocks off! We are about to become fucking legends on Wall Street! We got plans up here that's gonna take this company into the fucking stratosphere! Wolfie! Wolfie! Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them. Why should they be taking all our fucking money all the fucking time? This way we become the underwriters. It was our next big move. Finding companies to take public. IPOs. It was the only way these Wall Street pricks would ever stop thinking of us as some shitkicker bucket shop. We got Arncliffe International. See, we were a little different. We liked to get as fucked up as possible during our business powwows in order to stimulate our free-flowing ideas, which is why we were popping these ludes like they were M&M's. Steve Madden. We own the fucking companies We own the companies Don't know what a lude is? I'll tell you. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Looks like those ludes are working their magic on Donnie right now. The Quaalude, or lude, as it is commonly referred to, was first synthesized in  by an Indian doctor, that's dots, not feathers, as a sedative, and was prescribed to stressed-out housewives with sleep disorders. But pretty soon someone figured out that if you resisted the urge to sleep for just  minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass high from it. Didn't take long for people to start abusing ludes, of course. And in 1982, the U? S. government Schedule 1'd them. Along with the rest of the world. Which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left. No shit, you can't even buy 'em anymore. You people are all shit out of luck. What are you saying? What is it? Steve Madden. Steve. You remember those ads? Those giant-headed girls with the bug eyes wearing those big clunky shoes? My friend from school, Steve Madden. His friend from school, Steve Madden. Steve Madden was the name in women's shoes at the moment. And all of Wall Street was begging to take his company public.

I gave them each 1, bucks and told them what Nicholas had done. Then they kicked his ass. Thanks again, Officer. It's not like I cared about the  grand anyway. I was making that much almost every day through one rathole or another. Now a rathole is a friend, like Brad here, who held stock in his name for me. Who are you supposed to be, huh? Jack Nickle-Jew? I'd drive the price up then he'd sell and kick most of the profits back to You guessed it, me. All cash. None of it's on the books. A big no-no, of course, in the eyes of the law. Enter our new securities attorney, Manny Riskin.  bucks an hour to be the voice of doom. Listen to me. You piss up the SEC's leg, you end up with your tits in a ringer. Do not worry about it. I have the SEC under control. What the fuck are these imbeciles doing? Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Hey! We got the SEC in here. The Securities and Exchange Commission sent two lawyers down to review our files. So I set them up in our conference room and I had it bugged and the air conditioning turned up so high that it felt like Antarctica in there. Is it always this cold in here? I don't know. Then, while they were looking for a smoking gun in that room Arncliffe International is on fire. I was gonna fire off a bazooka in here, offering up our latest IPO. An IPO is an initial public offering. It's the first time a stock is offered for sale to the general population. Now, as the firm taking the company public, we set the initial sales price then sold those shares right back to our friends. The Look. I know you're not following what I'm saying anyway, right? That's okay. That doesn't matter. The real question is this. Was all this legal? Absolutely fucking not. But we were making more money than we knew what to do with.

A hundred Strattonites,  hookers, plus  more waiting once we landed. Oh, and the drugs. I mean, I tell you, our plane was like a pharmacy with wings. All told, the weekend cost me two million bucks, including the cost of refurbishing the entire th floor. Kiss the bride. But the wedding was something out of a fairy tale. With Naomi, my Duchess, me, her handsome Duke, and The Bahamas Ocean Club, our castle.

Next was a steam so I could sweat out the drugs still in my system. Then I'd assess the damage. Drown out my eyeballs. Take my back pills to get the day started, then seek to make up with Naomi. Good morning, Daddy. Where's my kiss? Hey, sweetheart. Does Daddy get a kiss from both of his little girls, huh? Oh, no. No, Daddy doesn't even get to touch Mommy for a very, very, very long time. Daddy's really sorry about what he said in the other room. He didn't mean any of it. Daddy shouldn't waste his time. And from now on, it's gonna be nothing but short, short skirts around the house. And you know something else, Daddy? Mommy is just so sick and tired of wearing panties.  Yeah? Yeah. In fact, she's decided to throw them all away. So take a good look, Daddy. You're gonna be seeing an awful lot of this around the house. Oh, baby Yeah, Mommy.  YeahBut no touching. Oh, gosh. What's wrong, Daddy? Baby. God! Look at this shit. Okay.

Of all the fucking days, she chooses today to give me blue balls! I mean, today was the biggest day in Stratton's history, and I needed to be thinking straight. Hey, Jordan!  Welcome? Steve here yet? This was the day that we launched the Steve Madden IPO. Troops are all here, everyone's all rallied, excited. Everything had to run tight. It had to be perfect. What the fuck is that kid doing?

A real wolf pit, which is exactly how I liked it. Jordan, look what I caught in the lobby. I caught a genius. Enter Steve Madden. The great American cobbler. Red-hot ladies footwear impresario. And thanks to Donnie, we were taking his company public. Stratton Oakmont was crawling out of the primordial ooze. Pond scum no more. That's why they gotta see your face. You get them fired up so they push the shit out of this stock. Okay? And not only that, Donnie and I secretly owned 7885% of Steve Madden Shoes, which legally speaking was a big no-no, but we'd get filthy fucking rich if our troops got behind it. Our job was to get them worked up. But not too worked up. Hello. If For those of you who don't know me My name's Steve Madden. Yeah, we know who you are. Your name is on the box. Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.  Show them the shoes? Okay. Yeah. Anyway, you know, this shoe is pretty cool. This is the Mary Lou, which is really the shoe that put me on the map.

You guys got that out of your systems, huh? You having a good afternoon or what? I wanna take a moment and tell you why Steve here is so absolutely off the fucking wall. It's because this man is a creative genius. This ability, this gift that Steve has, it goes beyond just spotting the hottest shoe trends. Steve's power is that he creates trends. You understand? Artists like Steve come along once every decade. I'm talking Giorgio Armani, Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent. Steve, come over here for a second.

They're called telephones. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about these telephones. They're not gonna dial themselves. Okay? Without you, they're just worthless hunks of plastic. Like a loaded M without a trained Marine to pull the trigger. And in the case of the telephone, it's up to each and every one of you, my highly-trained Strattonites. My killers! My killers, who will not take no for an answer! My fucking warriors, who will not hang up the phone until their client either buys or fucking dies! Let me tell you something. There is no nobility in poverty. I have been a rich man and I have been a poor man. And I choose rich every fucking time. Because at least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems, I show up in the back of a limo, wearing a $2, suit and a $40, gold fucking watch! Duke it out! Hit him! Get the fuck off me! And if anyone here thinks I'm superficial or materialistic, go get a job at fucking McDonald's, 86'cause that's where you fucking belong! But before you depart this room full of winners, I want you to take a good look at the person next to you. Go on. Because sometime in the not-so-distant future, you're gonna be pulling up to a red light in your beat-up old fucking Pinto, and that person's gonna be pulling up right alongside you in their brand new Porsche with their beautiful wife by their side, who's got big voluptuous tits. And who're you gonna be sitting next to? Some disgusting wildebeest with three days of razor-stubble, in a sleeveless muumuu, crammed in next to you in a carload full of groceries from the fucking Price Club! That's who you're gonna be sitting next to! So you listen to me and you listen well. Are you behind on your credit card bills? Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing! Is your landlord ready to evict you? Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing! Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking worthless loser? Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!

Are we fucking talking tonight, or are you gonna get schwacked? The last time you took these fucking pills, you put your head in the fucking macaroni. I had to pick it up. All right. Okay, I won't call him. Hey, fellas! Come on board. The plank's right around there. Welcome! What a nice day. Hey. Welcome aboard. Jordan. Welcome aboard the Naomi. Pleasure to meet you. Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes. Hi, how are you? Let me introduce you. This is Nicole, Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy. What are you guys all shy for? Don't be scared. These are friends of Stratton.  It's a pleasure? Hello. Your message said that you wanted to speak privately. Right. I do want to speak privately. Give us a minute, huh, ladies? Let me know if I can get you anything. We'd be happy to help. You guys hungry? Want something to eat? Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster. I got whiskey. Any kind of booze you want. You know what? The Bureau doesn't allow us to drink while we're at sea. Duh! Of course. Ever been on one of these before? A boat? I learned how to sail when I was six. No shit. Is that right? Really? On one like this though? I had the whole front extended in order to fit the chopper up there. See that? Anyway, this is for you. It's a complete list of every person that was at my wedding. I understand you wanted the whole wedding video. Figured this would help expedite the whole process, right?  There you go? Look, my point is that I know you're investigating Stratton. But for the life of me, I can't figure out why. I know we're a little unorthodox, we're a little loud in the way we do things. But you gotta understand, we're the new guys on the block, you know, we're trying to make a name for ourselves. But I want you to understand, we don't do anything illegal. Whatsoever. I mean, you could talk to the SEC. They were at my office  times over the last six months. I mean, I got I got nothing to hide. Well, you know the SEC is a civil regulatory agency. We pursue criminal activities. Exactly! You go after real criminals, which makes me wonder what the hell you're investigating me for? I mean, honestly What is it that you think that we did or do? I don't get it. Well, I Look, Jordan, I can't discuss an ongoing investigation. No, I get that. No, I understand. With that said This case got dumped on my desk  Did it? You know, by a higher-up who needs to make a show of looking into the new company on the block,  with all the press and everything? New loud guys. And then I end up being the schmuck who does the looking. Exactly. It's just, you know It bothers me. We're the new guy. We're the one that's banging on Wall Street's door. I mean, you should You should see what's going on at the bigger firms. I mean, I know all the information. It's true! Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Collateralized debt obligations? This Internet stock bullshit? I mean, it's a fucking travesty. I could take you step-by-step through what exactly is occurring. All you have to do is ask. I'm available. That's exactly what I wanted to hear. I don't see why a little sitdown like this can't be profitable for the both of us. It should. Right? It should profit the both of us.  It should? Look. I'm gonna give you my personal line. Five days a week, you just call me, feel free.  I'll do that? Great. Are you sure you guys don't want something to drink? You're not hungry? Nothing?  Nothing? No? Oh, no. Let me ask you, and if you don't wanna get too personal, just tell me to shut up at any time. Did you try to get your broker's license at one time? Did I hear that right? Were you trying to take a stab at Wall Street?  No? Who you been talking to? Who the fuck you been talking to? Well, you're investigating me. I hear things. You know what I mean? You ever think about what would've happened if you would have stayed the course? You know what? When I'm riding home on the subway and my balls are fucking sweating, I'm wearing the same suit three days in a row Yeah, you bet I do. I've thought about it before. Who wouldn't, right? Right, who fucking wouldn't? What do you get Another personal question, no need to answer No, that's all right, Jordan. What do you pull in? 50, K? Something like that? A year? In the ballpark? Well, I Let's put it this way. You get a free handgun when you sign up for the Bureau. No, but it fucking pisses me off. You know what I mean? You think about the people that built this country, hardworking people like you. Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents. End of the day, you guys get fucking skinned alive financially. It fucking makes me angry. Now the one thing about Wall Street and this market is, for me, I feel it's good to give back. You know, there's There are situations where I can make those situations better for people. You know? You know what I mean. Opportunity is everything. Exactly. Take for example, I got this one kid, right? Went to school for environmental science, something like that. He was bogged down by student loans. Turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery.  Jesus? Right. Horrible situation. Sure. But we got him into the market at the right time and chose the right stock. We gave him the right guidance. Boom! Overnight, changed his entire life. Got to put his mother into the best hospital in New York City. It didn't work out for her, granted, she passed away, unfortunately. But we gave him that opportunity. You know what I'm saying? It's just about setting up the right team, and then overnight your life can change. What does What does an intern What does an intern make in a deal like that? Well, in that situation, in that particular trade, and it was one trade, north of half a million dollars. And I'd do that for anybody, you know, anybody that needs the proper guidance. Can you say that again, just the way you said it? Just the same way. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, come on! You know what I'm talking about. I think what Jordan just did is he  If I'm not mistakenNo. You just tried to bribe a federal officer. No, technically I didn't bribe anybody. No, no, that's not the conversation I heard, Jordan. No, no, according to the U? S. criminal code, there needs to be an exact dollar figure for the exchange of services. That would not hold up in a court of law. Nah, it's not how I heard it. No, no, no, that's the truth. But I want to tell you this. Yeah. The same gentleman that told me that you tried to get your broker's license also told me that you are a straight arrow. He ran a security check on me. Well Yeah, when you sail on a boat fit for a Bond villain, sometimes you need to play the part. Right? I think it's time you both get the fuck off my boat. What do you say? You know, Jordan, I'll tell you something. Most of the Wall Street jackasses that I bust, they're to the manor born.  Is that right? Yeah. Their fathers are douchebags, just like their fathers before them. But you You, Jordan, you got this way all on your own. Did I?  Good for you, little man? Little man? Good for you. Me, the little man? And let me tell you something. Let me tell you something else. Honestly, I'm not bullshitting here, this is one of the nicest boats  that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you? I bet it is. And you know what I was just thinking too? The fucking hero that I'm gonna be back at the office when the Bureau seizes this fucking boat. Because, I mean, fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan, look at this thing! It's beautiful! And you got the beautiful girls there. It's wonderful. All right, get the fuck off my boat. I'm sure we'll be seeing each other  real soon? I'm sure. Good luck on that subway ride home to your miserable, ugly fucking wives. I'm gonna have Heidi lick some caviar off my balls in the meantime. Hey, you guys want to take some lobsters for your ride home? Fucking miserable pricks, I know you can't afford them! Fucking cheap fucks. Fucking miserable pricks. Hey, fellas! Look what I found in my pocket! Look! A year's salary right here. You know what I call them? Fun coupons! See that! They're fun coupons! Switzerland? What the fuck is in Switzerland? Swiss fucking banks, that's what. It was ass-covering time. I had to hide my money. Enter Rugrat. He knew this Swiss banker from law school. That's for European pussy! But he was in Geneva. And there was no way I was gonna make that flight sober. So I knew if I took my drugs right, I could sleep through the entire flight. But I had to take them just right. At 4: p? m., I popped a few more ludes, which started kicking in by the time I finished my sales meeting. My tingle phase. By dinner, I popped a few more on top of some cocktails and a Valium or two. My slur phase. By 8:30, I took a few more ludes and pretty much lost all my motor skills. This was the drool phase. And by 10:00, I didn't know who or what the fuck I was. The amnesia phase. We boarded the plane just before midnight. Wow! Look at you!  You're beautiful? Excuse me, sir. His sleeping pills just kicked in. He's all right. May I see your boarding passes, sir? We have the boarding passes. Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her. Hey! Fucking relax. Oh, my God! You got your hand on my fucking cock! I don't. Cut it out. He's got his hand on my dick again. I'm just trying to buckle you up. You got your hand on his dick? You gotta stop doing that in public places. Oh, my God. Take it off! Take it off! I heard there's a treasure map under here.  Stop! I know, miss? Excuse me, sir. Please sit down.  Watch it? Go back to your seat, please.  What are you upset about? Please go back to your seat. I will have to call the captain. Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down. Please sit down!  I'm going! Stop? Okay, sorry. We apologize. We're gonna go to sleep. Question. I wanna ask you a question. Fasten your seat belt, sir. We cannot take off if you haven't fastened  your seat belt? I'm really horny too. Sit down. Fasten it.  Right. Okay, I'll sit downI will do it for you.  What? I'll do it for you. You gotta speak English. We don't understand this language you're speaking. I will help him with his seat belt.  You gotta put it on right? Sit back. Sit back, sir.  There you go? All right. I'll just lean back Bitte, Hilfe! Jesus Christ! Fuck! Donnie Donnie, this isn't funny. You gotta untie me, buddy. I can't untie you. The captain tied you up. He almost fucking tasered you. Why? He's got a fear of flying. He's very nervous on planes, I'm sorry, it's not you, sweetheart, don't beat yourself up. Easy, easy. He's fine. He's just a nervous flyer. You were screaming at people. Oh, fuck off. You were on the floor rolling around and shit. Oh, Jesus. You called the captain the N-word. I called the captain the N-word?  Yeah, he was very upset? Really?  Luckily we're in first class? Jesus. Jesus Christ, I think you have a fucking drug problem. Where are the ludes? They're up my ass. Don't worry about it.  I got it? Okay. Thank God. Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do when we get to Switzerland, buddy? This is bad. Fucking things are against my chest. I can't breathe. Come on, do something to calm me down. Please. Okay, shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Okay.  That's good? Go to sleep. Rub it harder, buddy. You're all right. We all love you. Shut the fuck up! Mr. Belfort, you're free to go. Really?  Hey, Donnie? Yeah? When we get out there, try not to act like yourself. Okay? Let's make Geneva an asshole-free Donnie zone, all right? What are you fucking coming at me for? Hey, listen. The only reason you're sitting in this limo and not in a Swiss jail is because of my friend. Okay? Hilfe! We're here. We're here. Everyone calm down. Jordan Belfort! At last. Nicholas has told me so much about you. Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.  Pleasure to make your acquaintance? Nice to meet you. It's a joke. You'll understand when you're in the fucking seat. You need a bigger couch. For guests. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I don't understand. I'm sorry. I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws here. Wait. Yes. Excusez-moi, Jordan. Swiss custom requires  minutes of Blah, blah, blah.  Chit chat? Yeah, chit chat, thank you. Before business can be discussed. Yeah. Of course. Let's get down to it. What would you like to know? Under what circumstances would you be obligated to cooperate with an FBI or a U? S. Justice Department investigation, for example? 31Ã‡a depend. 31Ã‡a depend? Oui. 31Ã‡a depend on what, exactly? Whether America plans to invade Switzerland in the coming months. Shall I check if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croy?  Yes. Rue de la Croix? Croix. Croix. Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy. It's Croix. See, this is what he used to do back in law school. Check me.  Champagne. Champagne? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. French fries, pommes frites.  And that kind of stuff? That's funny. What I'm asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over? I understand perfectly, you American shit. The only way the Banque RÃ©al de GenÃ¨ve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued is also a crime in Switzerland. But there are very few Swiss laws which apply to your practices. From a financial standpoint, you are now in heaven. See, I told you he was fantastic, right? If the U? S. Justice Department sent us a subpoena, it would become papier toilette. We would wipe our ass with it. Unless, of course, it was an investigation into stock fraud, which is a crime here in Switzerland, if I'm correct. Then there would have to be coopÃ©ration on your part,  if I'm not mistaken? Yes. Yes, we would. Assuming the account is under your name. If it were another name, a friend's, camarade Cousin?  Relative? Yeah. Was that yodeling I just heard or did you just say what I thought you said? Yes. Yes. He's telling me to use a fucking rathole. But a U? S. rathole would never get into Switzerland with all that money. What I needed was a rathole with a European passport. Jordan. Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh? Welcome. Was the traffic terrible? Oh, no, not at all. Jordan, come in. Thank God Aunt Emma didn't need too much convincing. Turned out the British weren't too different from the Swiss. Money talks and bullshit takes the bus. How do you say rathole in British? If you get into any trouble whatsoever, I'll come forth immediately. I'll say that I duped you. That I promise. Risk is what keeps us young, isn't it, darling? Sometimes I wonder if you let money get the best of you, my love. Among other substances. It's that obvious, huh? It's chilly, darling, and you're sweating bullets. What can I say? I'm I'm a drug addict. I really am. Cocaine, pills, whatever it is, I'll fucking do it. Now that's the truth. I mean I'm a sex addict too. Well, there are worse things to be addicted to than sex. Jesus, why am I telling you all this? Why am I I'm sorry. Because I'm very easy to talk to. You are. You are easy to talk to. I suppose it's Just my job, you know. All these people dependent on me. Tens of millions of dollars at stake, you know. Sometimes I feel like I I've bitten off more than I can chew, you know. You're a man with large appetites. Yeah. Is she fucking hitting on me? Yeah. Yeah, I am. I suppose I put that on myself though, right? My decision. It's just hard to Hard to learn to control the anxiety sometimes, you know? You know, to Learn to relax and let go and To release the tension. She is hitting on me. Holy shit! Yeah, to release the tension. I suppose we We all just need to learn Learn to do what comes naturally in life, you know? Is he fucking hitting on me? Stability, dear. Family. You take care of my niece, my love. I'll take care of everything over here. Deal. Come on! There you go. We had, literally, a fuckload of money. Aunt Emma could never carry all this by herself. So I thought to myself, who else has a European passport? Brad, you're making this too fucking tight! Now Brad, as a successful drug dealer, spent his winters in the south of France, which is where he met his wife, Chantalle, a stripper of Slovenian origin born, in of all places, Switzerland. Well, this is fucked. No shit. Like, this will take her like  trips. I know. Let me ask you something? What about her family? Right? I mean, they all got Swiss passports, right. She's got parents, she's got a brother, right? The brother's got a wife. That's five fucking people. Six, seven trips, boom, right? They're all fucking Swiss nitwits like her.  They'll do it? We could do that. At least I have a family, you crooked-nose fuck! Hey, don't forget about my money. I'm sorry, what's that? Yeah, I forgot to tell you. He's got some  He's got some money? My money. I got a couple of mil coming in like a week. When it gets in, I'll give you a call, you come pick it up. You give me a call? When it gets here, I'll give you a call and you'll come pick it up. Well, we don't fucking work for you, man! Sweetheart, you have my money taped to your tits. Okay? Technically, you do work for me. Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk. If I fucking do this, I'm telling you right now, I ain't going to him, okay.  I'm not a fucking shvartze? I got it. I don't do fucking pickups, all right?  I got it? Well, listen to me. We meet someplace that I fucking say. And you tell that fucking piece of shit,  he comes correct? I will. He comes in all fucking loopy and fucked up, I swear to God I'll mash that douchebag's teeth in. You're gonna mash whose fucking teeth in? Whose fucking teeth are you gonna mash in? I put the money on that fucking table! Not you! I'm the reason we have this whole fucking deal!  He's got a gun, you fucking idiot!Fuck his gun! I put that money in there! You know what? You're a fucking pill dealer. I got five more just like you, bro. Keep talking, you fucking piece of shit! You know what else? You dress like shit! So fuck you!  Fucking motherfucker!Oh! Jesus! How about that, faggot? Who's a faggot? You okay? Hey, pal. The next day, Aunt Emma flew to Geneva. Two million in cash in her carry-on, which in the big picture was a drop in the Swiss bucket. 48'Cause the following month, over the course of six round trips, Chantalle's family and friends smuggled in over  million in cash without even a hiccup.  And I have some more? Really?  Here? Oh, thank you. And here.  Welcome? Welcome. Yeah, like four bags of it. Are you Swiss-Slovakian or Swiss-Slovenian?  Slovenian? Slovenian? Who cares. You're blonde. Oh, stop. Shit. Just put the fucking car in park, you dumb fucking idiot! I can't close this briefcase. One fucking day. One fucking day, you couldn't keep it together? I'm fucked up, Brad.  Gotta be fucking kidding me? Fucked up.  It's a joke? It's a joke?  I'm sober? Jesus fucking Christ! It's a fucking joke.  Are you fucking stupid? I'm not stupid. You fucking drive in here like a fucking maniac, you know the attention that that fucking draws?  I'm not stupid. I'm smart? Smart?  I make million-dollar deals? That right? With smart important people, unlike you. People who don't sucker-punch people when they're scared. Okay?  I'm scared, huh? And by the way, I haven't gotten an apology yet for that. You want an apology, okay. I check my fucking messages every day  when I come home from work? Did you?  My answering machine. Zero? Didn't get one, huh? I got a blinking light, because I don't have shit from you. You know what, you got a big fucking mouth, okay? I got my wife checking the messages every  minutes calling the office, saying, has Brad apologized yet? Is there an apology message on the machine? I don't have jack shit. You know what? That's not how you treat people. You got a big fucking mouth, you know. I'm gonna give you a fucking pass. Just give me the case. You're gonna give me a pass? Look, it's a figure of fucking speech. Oh, my gosh. The Emperor of Fucksville came down from Fucksville to give me a pass! From Fucksville, huh? Hey, what are the citizens of Fucksville doing today when their Emperor's gone? Is it mayhem? Are people looting and raping? What are all the little fuckheads doing while you're here? Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag. You back the fuck up. I'll cause the biggest fucking scene that I've ever caused in my life if you come at me again.  You know what? Just fucking keep it down. I got I don't wanna be out of line or anything, but I think you like, like me. Like you Like when you come at me What's the matter with you? What the fuck is And you look at me. I swear I just noticed it. You have like a fucking, like Like a twinkle. You have like a twinkle. Are you trying to kiss me, bro? Jesus fucking Christ.  What's with you? I have a I don't know.

Put your hands in the air! Get down. Get down on your knees! Get down on your knees! Motherfucker! Jordan, do I have a surprise for you!  What's that? Twenty real Lemmons. Retired pharmacist's client of mine, they've been in the safe for  years. Are you fucking kidding me? Lemmons? They're gonna knock us on our fucking heads. When it comes to Quaaludes, the Lemmon  was the Holy Grail.  Can you believe it? Oh, my God. I thought they were like a myth. Three times as powerful as anything available today. Look at these babies. Boy, Donnie really knew how to celebrate. He said he was saving these for a special occasion. Like a birthday, or being clap free, or our money arriving safely in Switzerland. So that night, I cleared my schedule and I rid my body of anything that could fuck with my high. It was celebration time. Okay. Start off with one, see how it goes? My guy says all we'll need is one. Here you go.  Salud!Cheers. Maybe if I pull it again, it'll go down. Steve! Steve! I gotta get out of here! Carl, I think I got it figured out. It must be one pull for up and two pulls for down. Okay. Do you feel anything? No. It's been  minutes. Maybe we've built up a tolerance after all these years, huh? This is bullshit! My metabolism's pumping. I can't feel shit! They're old.

Get out of here. What's going on? Listen to me! Leave the fucking house, Jordan, and then call me from a pay phone. This is not a fucking joke, Jordan. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.  Shit? What'd he say? I don't know what the fuck's going on.  I gotta go!Is everything okay, Jordan? The closest pay phone I could get to was at the Brookville Country Club. It was a real WASP stronghold, just a mile down the road from my house. Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me. What's going on? I'm at a pay phone. What's going on? Listen to me carefully. Please. Your little friend there, Brad, your little buddy, he's in jail. What the fuck's he in jail for?  What'd he do? I don't know what he did. My friends in Long Island told me he got picked up in some fucking shopping mall. He got locked up by Wait, wait. Did you Did you say a shopping mall?  Yeah? He was with Donnie. He was supposed to deliver some money,  then that fucking fat piece of shitListen to me! I gotta go fucking talk to him right now! Listen to me! Don't go! Listen to me.

You didn't try to bribe this fucking FBI agent, did you? No, I didn't try to bribe an FBI agent. You think I'm that fucking stupid? No. What the fuck did you say? I can't understand you.

I'm gonna send Rocco over to pick you up. Jordan! Jordan! After  years in storage, the Lemmons had developed a delayed fuse. It took  minutes for these little fuckers to kick in. But once they did I mean, I had skipped the tingle phase and went straight to the drool phase. Tell me where you are! Don't fucking drive These little bastards were so strong, I discovered a whole new phase. The cerebral palsy phase. Come on, stand up! Okay, walking's out. All right, think, think. What else is there? Yes! I can crawl. I can crawl like Skylar! Fuck! The kid makes it look so goddamn easy! Think, you motherfucker, think! Yes! I got it! I've got it! I can roll! I can roll! Jordan. Oh, Jesus. Where are you? I'm at a country club! What? I'm at a country club! I don't know what the fuck you're saying. Look, you need to get home. Donnie is out of control! He's on the other line with some Swiss guy. I don't know What? Get him off the phone! I can't understand you! Get him off the phone! I don't know what the fuck you're saying, Jordan.

You ate two million? Later. Get off the phone. Get off the fucking phone! Idiot! Get out of the way, asshole! You hate two million? No, you don't hate two million, Donnie.

Family man. Honey! It was a miracle I wasn't killed, or that I didn't kill anybody else. The cops took me in for questioning, but they couldn't charge me. They had no proof I was even behind the wheel. Meanwhile, Brad did three months in jail for contempt because he wouldn't rat Donnie out. The result, I was scot-free. But I had eyes on me like never before. You're a lucky man, Jordan. You're lucky to be alive, let alone not in jail. You know I don't believe in luck, right? But it's time. Please, let me call the SEC and cut a deal before your luck runs out. Wave to Daddy. Hey. Hey, sweetie. What kind of terms would you be talking about if I I don't know. You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations, stock manipulation, high-pressure sales tactics. Ticky-tack shit like that, you know. You pay a couple million dollars in fines, in exchange, the SEC fucks off till the end of time. And Stratton? What happens to Stratton? There's no way I mean You got to walk away. Right? Let Donnie be in charge. Right. Donnie. Now the FBI is another animal completely. They'll still be pursuing you for criminal wrongdoing. However, with you stepping down voluntarily, my guess is that your best friend Agent Denham will be standing around with his dick in his hand. Jordan. What do you have to think about? You beat them. You won! God knows you never have to work again. What're you gonna do? Spend the rest of your life in jail?  Is that what you want? No.  Of course not? Okay. Okay! You got all the money in the world. You need everybody else's money?  Of course not, Pops? Well?  You know, I built it? I know you built it. You built it, so now preserve it. You know, five years ago, when I started Stratton Oakmont with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day would eventually come where I'd have to be moving on. And it's truly with a heavy heart that I'm here to say that That that day is finally here. I wanna I want to thank you all for your your years of loyalty and admiration. But the point is this. Under Donnie's leadership, along with Nicky Koskoff and Robbie Feinberg moving into key management positions, this place really is gonna be better than ever! That I promise you. Okay? Give them a round of applause. Come on. This is Ellis Island here, people. I don't care who you are, where you're from, whether your relatives came over on the fucking Mayflower or on an inner tube from Haiti, this right here is the land of opportunity. Stratton Oakmont is America! All of you know Kimmie Belzer, right? Yes, we do. Fuck you. Come on, Kimmie. What you probably didn't know is, Kimmie was one of the first brokers here, one of Stratton's original 20. Now most of you met Kimmie, the beautiful sophisticated woman that she is today. A woman that wears $3, Armani suits. Who drives a brand-new Mercedes-Benz. A woman who spends her winters in the Bahamas and summers in the Hamptons! That's not the Kimmie that I met. The Kimmie that I met didn't have two nickels to rub together. She was a single mom on the balls of her ass with an eight-year-old son. Okay? She was three months behind on her rent. And when she came to me and asked me for a job, she asked for a $5, advance just so she could pay her son's tuition. And what'd I do, Kimmie? Go on, tell them. You wrote me a check for $25,000. That's right. Thank you. And you know why that is? It's because I believed in you. It's because I believed in you, Kimmie, just like I believe in each and every one of you here today.  I fucking love you, Jordan!I fucking love you. I fucking love you! I love you. I fucking love you too! I fucking love you too! And I love all of you! And I love all of you from the bottom of my heart.  I fucking love you too? I mean that. You are the shit. You are the fucking shit. It's a shame, you know. For years, I've been telling you guys never to take no for an answer, right? You know, to keep pushing, to never hang up the phone until you get what you want. Because you all deserve it. You know, this fucking deal that I'm about to sign barring me from the securities industry, barring me from Stratton, my home. What the fuck is that, you know? I'll tell you what it is. It's It's me taking no for an answer, you know. It's them It's them selling me, not the other way around. It's me being a hypocrite is what it is. So You know what? I'm not leaving. I'm not fucking leaving! You're not getting a fucking promotion! The show goes on! This is my home! They're gonna need a fucking wrecking ball to take me out of here! They're gonna need to send in the National Guard or fucking SWAT team 94'cause I ain't going nowhere! Fuck them! Jordy! Jordy! Jordy! Get back here! Hey! Give me that. What is this? Ramar of the Jungle, for Christ sake? Paddy D, mazel tov, you Irishman. Jordan Belfort just welched on his deal with the SEC. He is back in the ocean. Happy hunting. It was our time to party big. And just as Brad was released from jail too. I apologized, even offered to pay him for his time in the can. But he said no, that he was out. He didn't want any part of us. Sad thing was, two years later he was dead. Massive heart attack. Thirty-five. Same age Mozart died. Not that they have a hell of a lot in common, but Anyway, I don't know why that came to mind. Within days, subpoenas started flying. Notices to produce documents, depositions, you name it. Donnie couldn't drink water fast enough. United States government wants to give me a subpoena? Here's what we do with subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont! Fuck you, USA! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Jordan Belfort. Alden. That's a nice name. Thank you very much for that.  What kind of name is that? That is my name. I do not recall that. I do not recall that. Okay? Mr. Ming, thank you for coming in today. Are you gonna finish the rest of that Danish?  Can I have that Danish? No, no, go ahead. They interrogated everybody. I got a low blood sugar, thyroid thing. It went on for months. It was a total fucking harassment. Tell him to proceed with the questions. But not a single Strattonite cracked. Gladys Carrera? Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry, I have no recommendation of that. No. No idea. I don't recall that transaction. You guys have any milk? Absolutely not. Francis Sortigi you called so many times I just thought you might remember that. Would you remember any of those?  I do not recall any of that? This Abdul I do not No, I don't recall. It was a long phone call. I just wondered if you have any memory of that. Okay. You know we've talked to several of the employees at this firm and nobody can recall anything about this Steve Madden IPO. I think it's odd. Do you recall Cartage Corporation? You do recall it? No, I don't recall that at all. Excuse me. I have to ask. Is that your real hair? Are you gonna say anything about that? Are you gonna comment on my hair? Is that how we're doing Is this personal questions? I'm just wondering why you would wear something like that. Sorry. I don't recall that company. Can I get you anything else, gentlemen? Yes. Sweetheart, I have a rare condition which requires me to drink one of those every  minutes, please. We were specifically advised not to leave the country. So, we took our wives to Italy. We figured we were safer working from overseas giving orders to Rugrat. Nobody could arrest us and nobody could prove I was still running Stratton from a yacht. Hey, Rugrat. Bonjour. You bald-headed eagle, how you doing? Donnie, Donnie, listen! We have a problem, okay. Your friend, Steve Madden, is unloading shares. What are you saying? Who told you that?  What's going on? He's doing it, Donnie! He said that Steve Madden's unloading shares. Who told you that? It's bullshit! Give me that goddamn phone. What's going on? Jordan, look. I'm watching the screen and huge chunks of Steve Madden are being sold, okay. It's not coming from us, so it's gotta be Steve. He's the only person with that many shares. It's Donnie. Call me back, all right. Donnie, your little friend is trying to fuck me, you know that. Your little friend is trying to fuck me right in the ass.  Get him on the phone now!We don't know anything yet. Let's not jump to conclusions. Even though I owned 85% of Steve cocksucking motherfucking Madden Shoes, the shares were in his fucking name. This motherfucker knew I was in trouble with the feds and was trying to take advantage. Talk to me, man. How do you wanna play this? I want you to get all our clients on the phone right now and have them start selling Steve Madden. We're gonna drive that fucking price down! Do you hear me? Shut the fuck up! This is your fucking friend from high school. If that little fucking prick thinks he can fuck with me, we'll turn his company into a penny stock! You hear me?  You got it? Yes. I got it! Let's just not jump to conclusions before we know what's going on. Captain Ted! Hang up your phones! Everybody, hey! Turn the boat around! We're going home! Baby! Baby, what happened? I just Sweetheart, what's going on? Aunt Emma Just wait. I can't What's going on? Why you crying?  She's dead!Who? Who's dead? I just got a call from my cousin Betty. Yeah? Aunt Emma is dead.  Are you fucking kidding me? No. You're serious? Oh, my God! Baby, that's Oh, fuck! Oh, sweetheart, that's just Fucking heart attack! Boom, snap, gone. Shuffled off her mortal coil. And $ million stuck in a Swiss bank account. The last time I talked to her she was fine!  She's not that old? Oh, God! Baby, oh, God! That's so fucking terrible! Oh, fuck! It is terrible. Your aunt was such an elegant, attractive woman. My condolences to you and your family. Yes. We're absolutely devastated. Thank you so much for your condolences. Now where does that leave us in regard to her account exactly? Does it go into probate or what? Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry. Your aunt, before she died, signed a document naming you as her successor. She did? Fantastic! Well, that's good news! Well, not as of yet. What does that mean? Not as of yet? I can't seem to hear you. I must have bad reception. Are you speaking English?  Very Now. Fast. Very fast? Fast? I have to get to Switzerland now? Speak English! Fucking speak English! Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Quiet, okay? Take your suit, take your dick, okay,  and move your ass! Please? Okay. Move my ass! Yes! I gotta say, these Swiss were some sneaky motherfuckers. Within minutes, he had me set up with a forger who could fake Aunt Emma's signature. You American shit! I just had to get there by tomorrow, or lose $ million. We're going to Monaco!  Monaco? Now? Yes, baby. We're going to Monaco, so then we can go to Switzerland, okay?  But her aunt just died? I realize that. But I have business in Switzerland. I need to go to Switzerland right now. Bottom line. Sorry. We gotta get to London. Why? Why? The funeral! Yeah, but, babe. Look, look I loved your aunt more than anyone in the entire world. I really did. But she's dead now, sweetie. She's dead and she's not going anywhere. She'll still be dead by the time we get to London, okay? Captain Ted! Captain Ted, all right, look. We're going to Monaco. Monaco now, okay? Monaco, right. We're going to Monaco so that we can drive to Switzerland so they don't stamp our passports. Take care of business here, we'll drive back to Monaco, take a flight over to London to catch the funeral and be in New York in three fucking business days! That's the fucking plan. I just want you to know that we might run into some chop. Chop? We can fucking handle chop, right? I mean, it's a  foot yacht. No, no, no. We're not going anywhere unless he says it's safe, all right.  Don't worry about the chop? It's safe. You don't know shit about chop. Oh, really? And you do? You're a fucking expert on that. I'll chop your fucking credit card in half. How about that? Chop is fine. Trust me. Chop is fine. Is chop fine, Captain Ted? Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow. Yeah, we're gonna take it slow. It's a little uncomfortable. Tell them it's safe. It's gonna be safe. We'll batten down the hatches and secure the deck. And we're looking at a few Maybe a few broken dishes. Few broken dishes. What's a few broken dishes? Does that sound fucking awesome or what? No. Not really. We're gonna have a fucking good time! Let's go to fucking Monaco now! Let's fucking move! Let's go! Hold on! What the fuck is going on out here? The Jet Skis just went overboard! Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay? Gale warning! Gale warning! The waves are  feet high and building! Turn around, let's go the other fucking way.  We can't!Go! We'll get broad-sided. It'll tip over! I am a master diver. You hear that? I'm a master diver! No one's gonna fucking die! I got you, baby. I got you. Trust me, okay? I love you. I love you, baby. Just hold on tight. Okay. Donnie! Hold on, baby! Donnie!  What? Hold on, baby. Get the fucking ludes. I don't wanna die, Jordan!

We're going down! This is a fucking Mayday! We require immediate assistance! Hold on! Watch out! The nice thing about getting rescued by Italians is that they feed you, make you drink red wine, then you get to dance. Did you see that? That was the plane I sent to come get us. I shit you not, it exploded when a seagull flew into the engine. Three people killed. You want a sign from God? Well, after all this, I finally got the message. Do you dream of becoming financially independent but struggle every month just to pay your bills? Would you like to own a home like this, but can barely afford to pay your rent? My name is Jordan Belfort, and there's no secret to wealth creation. No matter who you are, no matter where you came from, you too can become financially independent in just a matter of months. All you need is a strategy. When I was  years old, I made a decision not just to survive, but to thrive. At first I didn't feel like deals like these were possible. But we have the house and we have a $33, profit. I certainly believe now. Think about it for a second. If you don't have the guts to attend Jordan Belfort's Straight Line Persuasion System seminar, then how do you expect to make any money? If you want to be a millionaire someday, have some guts. Make a decision. Jordan Belfort's setup worked for me because I worked hard for it. And if it doesn't work for you, it's because you're lazy. And you should get a job at McDonald's. There's nobody holding you back from financial freedom. And there's nobody stopping you from making millions. Don't just sit at home, or the life of your dreams will sail right past you. I changed all these people's lives and I can change yours too! So come to my seminar! The life of your dreams is only Good to see you again, Jordan. You're under arrest! You gotta be joking! You're kidding me. Hey, get the fuck away from me! Turn that camera off. I'm fucking shooting a fucking infomercial here, you fucking cocksucker!  Fuck you, you motherfucker!Shut the fucking camera off. You don't got shit on me, you hear me! Go fuck yourself! I'm making an honest living, you fucking piece of shit! Hey, Jordan, let me give you a little legal advice. Shut the fuck up! Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick! I'm making an honest living, you motherfucker! I clean up my act. I did rehab. I'm a TV personality. I'm sober for two years. And this happens! Rugrat goes and gets busted down in Miami. I'm Swiss, I'm not communist. And guess who the fuck with? Saurel.  You gonna beat me? No, sir. Yeah, I know your country. You're gonna beat me. I mean, what are the fucking odds? There had to be 10, Swiss bankers in Geneva, and Rugrat gets the one dumb enough to get himself arrested on U? S. soil. I know. I'm so sorry. Even more fucked was that he got busted for shit that had nothing to do with me. It had nothing to fucking do with me. Something about laundering drug money through offshore boat racing and a guy named Rocky Aoki, you know, the founder of Benihana. Benihana. Beni-fucking-hana! Why? Why, why, God? Why would you be so cruel as to choose a chain of fucking hibachi restaurants to take me down? Long story short. Saurel rats me out. But not before he rats out Brad's wife, Chantalle, who, it turns out, he'd been fucking every time she went to Switzerland!  No, no, no, it's impossible? Oui, oui, oui. All right! One count engaging in conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Two counts securities fraud. One count engaging in conspiracy to commit money laundering. Twenty-one counts money laundering. One count obstruction of justice. Bail is set at $ million. Uncle Donnie's here! Rocky. How you doing? I hate that fucking dog. Yeah, he's getting old and decrepit. Starting to shit in the house again.  Me too? Come here, buddy. Ah, fuck.  It's good to see you, pal? Yeah, you too. Good to see you. Sit down. Oh, man. How you doing, brother? You know. Shitty, pal. But I'm hanging in there. My new piece of jewelry. Check that out. Can't leave the house, you know? Starting to get cabin fever already. Fucking Rugrat. That wig-wearing faggot. I can't believe that fucking guy. I wanna kill him. Swear to God, I want to choke him to death. Irresponsible little prick. I'll tell you one thing. I'm never eating at Benihana again. I don't care whose birthday it is. Where's Naomi? How's she doing? That's her in the house there. You could say hi, but she probably won't wave back. Naomi, sweetheart! What's up her ass?  Is she mad at me? No, you know We probably have to mortgage the house in order to make bail. Probably end up selling the thing in order to pay for all the lawyers. It's been a nightmare, buddy, to tell you the truth. What are you gonna do, right? Anyway, how's Stratton? That's more important. How's morale? They all pissed off 'cause they have to make money legally now? Jordan. I got the founding partners together. I talked to them about everything. And I got you. What do you mean, you got me? The house, money, don't worry about it. I got you. All right. I love you, buddy.  You know I'd do it for you, right? I know.  You know that, right? I know. I could fucking kiss you all over. All right, enough, enough. You want a beer, pal? What are you drinking? I got this non-alcoholic shit. What's that? A non-alcoholic beer. It's got no alcohol.  It's a beer? Yeah, with no alcohol. But if you drink enough, if you drink a lot, they get you fucked up? No, there's no alcohol. That's the fucking point. I'm not a scientist. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. I can get you a beer if you want a fucking beer. I know, but I don't drink. You remember? I don't drink anymore. Oh, you wanna go inside and blow some lines of baking powder? Or baking soda Can't imagine ever not enjoying getting fucked up.  Yeah? I love it. How's being sober?  Fucking sucks? Boring, right? So boring. I wanna kill myself. There's a term, and we don't like to use it unless circumstances dictate, and I think they do dictate in this case, and the term is Grenada. Have you ever heard of Grenada? No. No, I haven't. Grenada's very interesting because it is a small island nation that was invaded by the United States of America in 1983. It's about 90, people. And essentially, it means this case is unloseable. Okay? So, you know, we can come in, we can have our dick hanging out of our pants. Nobody gives a fuck. I'm gonna win. You, sir, are what's known as a Grenada. You're looking at real prison time. Money laundering can get you as much as  years. And our case couldn't be stronger if we caught you shoving cash in your mattress. Is that right? Hey, Jordan. Jordan. Your rotting away in jail till your kids get out of college, that's not our ambition here. There's other people involved in this too. We think they need to see their day in court as well. Why do I sense there's an offer in the air? Look at him. He's got a sense. What are you, Kreskin? Full cooperation. He provides us with a comprehensive list of all the co-conspirators spanning the last seven years, and he also agrees to wear a wire. Wait Did you just say wear a wire? A wire. What does that mean? You want me to rat? Is that it? No, I want you to cooperate.  No. You want me to rat, right? Yes. We want you to rat. That's fucking exactly what we want you to do. To rat. How was Cristy's party? Fine. Good. Babe, I spoke to the lawyers again today. I have some really, really great news. Turns out you're completely off the hook, honey. I know that already. Right. Exactly. You never did anything wrong in the first place, right? It turns out, all the FBI really wants from me is to cooperate. You know? Turns out I have so much information about the stock market and Wall Street, I could save the government years of heartache, not to mention countless dollars. But it gets even better, babe. Because if I do decide to cooperate, I might only be looking at four short years, in which case, you know, we could start fresh, maybe sell the house. And any fines that I'd have to pay wouldn't be due till after I serve my term, so we'd still have plenty of money left over, you know? The only thing that of course bummed me out a little bit is this whole idea of having to give information about my friends. Like you said, there's no friends on Wall Street. Right? Right. Right. Exactly. There's a silver lining to that too, honey. Because they said eventually Eventually everyone's gonna have to give information on this case. So, at the end of the day, it might not even be a factor. You know? Well, that's good news. Right? Yeah, yeah. I'm really happy for you. What do you mean, happy for me, sweetheart? You should be happy for the both of us. Right?  Yeah, right? All right. Come here, baby. Give me a kiss, sweetheart. Jordan Oh, come on, baby. I haven't made love to you in so long. Please.  No. Jordan, stop it? Come on, honey, please. No! Jordan, stop it! I've loved you since the moment I saw you. I fucking hate you, Jordan.  Get off me!Baby Don't do that. You know how much I love you, right? Stop that, sweetie. Please. You wanna fuck me, Jordan? You wanna fuck me? Good. Go ahead. Go ahead and fuck me. I want you to fuck me real hard. I want you to fuck me like it's the last fucking time.  Why are you moving like that? Come on. Please hold still. 47'Cause I want you to come for me, baby. Come on, babe. Come for me, baby. I want you to come for me like it's the last fucking time.  Yeah? Yeah. Come on, baby. Come for me. Come for me, baby. Come on, baby.  Yeah? Yeah.  Yeah, baby, come? You want me to come for you? Yeah.  You want me to come for you? Yeah! You want me to come for you? Oh, God, baby. Yeah! Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Jesus. Oh, baby. That was so fucking great! Oh, God! That was the last time. What do you mean, baby? I mean that was the last time we ever have sex. What are you talking about? I want a divorce. What do you mean, you want a divorce? What's that supposed to mean, you want a divorce? Get off me! I want a divorce. You just made love to me. What the fuck is wrong with you? I don't love you anymore, Jordan! Oh, you don't love me? You don't love me anymore, huh? Well, isn't that just fucking convenient for you! Now that I'm under federal indictment, with an electronic bracelet around my ankle, now you decide you don't fucking love me anymore.  Is that right? No, no. What kind of person are you? Tell me. You married me! What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Jordan, this is how it's gonna go. I'm gonna take custody of the kids. If you agree to the divorce right now, I will allow visitation.  Okay? Don't try to fight it? Oh, my God. It'll save us both a lot of money and I got a feeling you're gonna need it. You're not taking my kids, sweetheart. You hear me? I've already talked to the lawyer. He said even if you don't get convicted, I've got a good chance of getting them. I got news for you. You're not fucking taking my children, you vicious fucking cunt, you! Fuck you, you fucking bitch! You're not fucking taking my goddamn fucking kids! You hear me? Fuck you! You're not fucking taking my fucking kids! Fucking bitch! Fucking whore! Fucking bitch! Piece of shit fucking whore! Look at yourself, Jordan. You're sick! You're a sick man! Fuck you! I told you, you're not taking my fucking kids! You think I would let my kids near you? Look at yourself! You know what my lawyer said? My lawyer said that you're going to prison for  years, Jordan. Twenty fucking years! You're never gonna see the kids again! You don't think I'm not gonna see my No, I'm not fucking letting you near my kids! You don't think I'm gonna see my fucking kids again, huh? Don't you fucking touch them! Don't you fucking touch me! Sweetheart? You're coming on a trip with Daddy, all right? You're coming on a trip with Daddy. Don't you fucking touch her, Jordan. I swear to God, I will fucking kill you! It's all right, baby. You and Daddy are gonna go on a little trip together, okay?  A little trip together? Violet! Violet!  Get the key! Get the key!I got it! Jordan, you open this fucking door  right now!

Wolfie! The first name on the list was Donnie. Jordan, do you know how good it is to have you back in this office? It's not the same when you're gone. It's sad, you understand? It's like That fucking Steve Madden, huh? I can't Swear to God, I can't even think about it. Every time I think about him, my blood boils. I can't even say his name.  I know? It's, like, disgusting.

The sentence of the court shall be  months in federal prison. Please remand the defendant. I'm sorry. That's okay. I'm not ashamed to admit it. When we arrived at the prison, I was absolutely terrified. Belfort, on your feet. But I needn't have been. You see, for a brief fleeting moment, I'd forgotten I was rich. And I lived in a place where everything was for sale. Wouldn't you like to learn how to sell it? So listen. I've met some bad motherfuckers in my life. I'm talking about rock stars, professional athletes, gangsters. I'm telling you, some real bad motherfuckers. But this guy, my good friend, Mr. Jordan Belfort, is the single baddest motherfucker I have ever met.

But there is really only one story out there that everybody in the market is watching and that is the Dynacorps IPO. This truly is a historic day. We knew from the road show the demand for the stock was going to be strong. We expected to see a pop at the open. But nobody thought Dynacorps would soar like this all the way to 47, and it looks like it is still climbing at this hour, so a much better debut than investors could have hoped for. Of course, with this kind of move you wonder whether the stock may have been mispriced whether or not perhaps they left a little money on the table. We know that they actually switched underwriters going into this IPO, so there was a bit of concern about how things would shake up, but clearly Dynacorps\\' IPO is shaping up to be one of the most successful public offerings of the year. So what happened with Dynacorps? Neel, I have taken nine Silicon Valley companies public in the last five years and you want to talk about the one I didn\\'t take to the finish line? I work for the largest investment bank in the world. We both know I found you guys capital when you were just a couple kids with a laptop and a dream. So we can talk about Dynacorps or we can talk about you and how I\\'m gonna grow your company so you can build technology that will transform people\\'s lives? Try the Tasmanian sea trout? Yeah, maybe I should? Okay? Okay. Hi? Hi. I saw the e-mail from Neel. Mm. He does love to play hard to get. Everyone likes to think their company\\'s a unicorn? You read up on the other companies? Yeah, so I was looking at Cachet? I have a hunch they\\'re looking to expand. You\\'ve got the numbers on them? I will bring them right over. Great. Yeah? Everyone\\'s saying there\\'s gonna be some movement around here. So I\\'m wondering if now might be the timeto talk about that promotion? No. Now is not the right time. HR is out there snatching BlackBerries. I get that. But I\\'ve been under-compensated two years in a row Erin, I told you I\\'d make a push for you, and I will. But it is a down year. I do need those numbers ASAP. Naomi? Excuse me. Sam, hi. I You know, I meant to reach out when I heard you were doing this, but I I thought you hated alumni events. WellBut I think this is important? Yeah. I think these girls look at me as what not to do. How to go to law school and still end up broke. Well, I\\'m sure there must be one young idealist in here somewhere. I hope so. Heh. So how are you? How are things? Are you still at the U? S. Attorney\\'s Office locking up drug dealers? I am. Uh, I\\'m actually in your area now. White-collar crime, uh, securities. Wow, that\\'s quite a change. And you\\'re at Remson still? I\\'m a lifer. Golden handcuffs. Yeah. You got a file on us? I imagine we have a file on everyone. You know, I was just thinking the other night about the evening of Goatee Guy? No, no? Yeah, yeah. That was horrifying? The most awful walk of shame? It was awesome. No, it\\'s not awesome. There\\'s nothing awesome about it. Know what? We really should get together. It\\'s been forever. I would love that? Me too? I\\'ll, um  I\\'ll see you on the panel? Yeah. See you up there. I\\'m wondering, for each of you, what\\'s that thing that really makes you want to get up in the morning? Well, for me, I guess, the simplest answer is I like money. I do. I like numbers. I like negotiating. I love a challenge. Turning a no into a yes. But I really do like money. I like knowing that I have it. I grew up in a house where there was never enough. I was raised by a single mom with four kids. I took my first job on Wall Street so I could put my little brothers through college. But I am not going to sit here and tell you that I only do what I do to take care of other people, because it is okay to do it for ourselves. For how it makes us feel. Secure? Yeah. Powerful? Absolutely. I am so glad that it\\'s finally acceptable for women to talk about ambition openly. But don\\'t let money be a dirty word. We can like that too. Did I see you in a dress last night? Shut up. So you go to the thing? You talk to her?  Your friend? I did. And? She give you anything on the hedge fund guy? I haven\\'t seen the woman in eight years. What exactly do you think she\\'ll give me at our appearance at an alumni event? Look, this was your idea to nail Benji through your banker friend, not mine. I said I\\'d make contact. And? I made contact. Naomi, thanks for coming. You know Leslie from HR? She needs a couple more names from your department. Teddy Sidel and Arthur Abbott. You do know who Teddy\\'s uncle is? You asked me to identify the weakest performers. What you do with that information is up to you. Okay. I guess you\\'ve heard the talk. I\\'m getting out. Retiring. Congratulations, Randall. You never want to stay at the party too long. Your turn. Steady now. So they\\'ll be naming a new global head. Look, Naomi, I\\'m gonna be frank with you. This doesn\\'t look like your year. Because of Dynacorps? I did ask around about what happened there. And the perception is that you rubbed some people the wrong way. They\\'re looking for a rainmaker. Hm. You\\'re hesitating. Push it. Go. Go! Go! Go! Go. I mean, at least hit me with some facts. Use my numbers against me. But perception? What the fuck do I do with that? You haven\\'t told me the details about that deal. You didn\\'t discuss it at the board meeting? Apparently I wore an awful dress.  Oh, men don\\'t do this, right? Hmm? You don\\'t You don\\'t lose sleep over this kind of stuff, do you? Oh, yeah, yeah, we do. We just don\\'t We just don\\'t turn in on ourselves. No, it\\'s much more fun  to get really pissed at someone else? Ooh. Yeah. What\\'s the biggest deal you could get right now? Cachet just added their th board member. Right. So they\\'re going public? I found VCs for that kid when he had five employees. Huh.  What time\\'s your car coming? Four-thirty. Oh, Jesus, babe. You need to sleep. Please don\\'t tell me what I need. Okay. I get it. You have to win the bake sale. Bake off. Bring me a brownie. Hm. I am bringing home the fucking bakery.  Yes!Yes. That\\'s right. Oh, where are you going? Heh. I\\'m going to bed. I hope I never have to battle you for anything. Because you\\'d lose. Here\\'s your coffees.  Thank you so much. I appreciate that? Thanks.  Hey, was that Channing Trust? Yeah, dude. My uncle said Remson\\'s tapping the guy with the glasses for new global head.  When I was a kid, if you wanted privacy if you wanted to send a secret message you made invisible ink with vinegar. And when you were ready to go public you revealed your secret message with grape juice. Hm. But there\\'s nothing secret about what brings us all together today. I\\'d like to introduce you to my VP Erin Manning. She\\'ll go through some specifics of our proposal. Cachet certainly has taken privacy to the next level and we are so pleased to have had a chance to foster that growth. If you open your pitch books to page two you\\'ll see in the first model, we\\'re predicting a valuation of a little over a billion, at  to  a share. Well, you\\'re certainly presenting us with some compelling numbers. You guys can tell we\\'ve done our homework. But that\\'s not why you\\'re gonna give me this deal. Okay. I remember what you told me the first day we met. You said, \"We\\'re not a social media company with privacy settings. We\\'re a privacy company that can build a social network. An impenetrable social network.\" I understood that. The need for it. I felt it in my gut. Now, some other people thought you guys were paranoid. Right? Investors wouldn\\'t go for it. Now fast forward. Edward Snowden. The Sony hack. Nude photos of actresses. Your revenue jumps. Your competitors start rolling out. But we were ahead of the curve because we understood that it gets harder every day to trust people in this world. And security is the hottest commodity.  Cheers? Cheers.  Go, us? Well done. Heh, heh.  Cheers? Cheers. No, no, no. Don\\'t stand up. I\\'m with a client. I just wanted to say, uh congratulations.  Great work, all of you? Thank you.  Thank you. Randall, you know Erin? Of course. She did spectacular work on this one. Always good to hear. Again, congratulations. I recommend the New York Strip. Heh, heh.  New York Strip it is? Well How far along are you? It\\'s really early. Six weeks? Wow. Well, congratulations. Thanks. Okay, I\\'ll see you in a minute. Oh, fuck. Mark your calendars. August th will be the IPO for the privacy company Cachet. Seems like every time there\\'s a hacking scandal Cachet\\'s sales increase dramatically. Bloomberg News has learned that Naomi Bishop will be the lead banker on the deal. Some money managers surprised by this after she ruffled some feathers in an earlier IPO. Also in the new  Thank you. Step away from the BlackBerry. Ah! Jeez. Nicely done. You know what\\'s weird about the whole privacy thing? What? Half the world is paranoid and the other half\\'s password is \"password.\" That\\'s true. What\\'s your lamest password? I\\'m so not telling you my passwords. Oh, come on, old school. Like \\'96.  \\'96? IMm-hm.  \"Bankerchick.\"Oh.  \"Bankerchick,\" huh? Mm-hm. That\\'s really kind of hot.  Is it? Mm. Hell, yeah, Bankerchick.  Who the hell is that? I don\\'t know. Oh, shit. It\\'s Erin. VP Erin? Hi, Erin. Hi. Sorry. Thanks. Bye, Erin. Bye. Now where were we?  NAOMI : This is Naomi? Hey, gorgeous. How are things up on the th floor? Mm. You still have the better view, but it\\'s a good day.  Pitch went well? Turn on Bloomberg. Then let\\'s celebrate. Okay, later. Later? What about that empty office up on 18?  Michael? What are you wearing? Heh, heh. Michael, we cannot. Hey, Compliance, are you listening? The only wall we\\'re crossing here is the wall of love. Oh, Mich Never a dull moment here in Compliance. That That\\'s his company phone? Isn\\'t that crossing the wall? Well, technically there\\'s nothing criminal here. So Remson doesn\\'t have a policy prohibiting this kind of romantic relationship between two employees? Some banks do, but nope. What\\'s your gut on this guy? Michael? He has instincts. Some people have instincts. Some people are getting a tip. And? We keep our eye on him. Hello. Hey. Here you go. Thank you. Remind me why I didn\\'t marry you. Diamonds. Remson holiday party, \\' something. Randall introduced us?  The St. Regis? Yes. You asked me who bought these and I saw you puff up your chest, ready to fight off some rival but then I told you I bought them for myself.  Ah? Mm-hm. Yeah, well, men like a girl they can take care of. Someone should remind them about alimony. People seem to like your Cachet thing. Yeah.  Remember my friend Marco? Um Oh, from Stanford, right? The tech blogger guy? Yeah, he writes about encryption and secrecy whisper-funds, all that kind of spy shit. He seemed to think that Cachet was gonna go well. We hope so. Yeah, what about you? Think they\\'re onto something? I do. Have you started due diligence yet?  Michael? Hm? What, you You want to build a Chinese wall in my apartment? Well, I just I think it\\'s simpler and better if we don\\'t talk shop. Okay. Okay. Who\\'s watching us tonight? Hello? Sam? Sophie wants to know who\\'s babysitting them tonight. Uh, Lisa from downstairs. I hate Lisa. You don\\'t hate Lisa. She\\'s got weird hair. Okay, that is not kind.  She\\'s not a real babysitter? You know, they do have a point. You know I have rehearsal every Tuesday. Something came up. It happens. Drinks? With some friend from childhood?  I told you, it\\'s work? Mm-hm. Are you investigating her? Lisa is fine. You crazies love the games on her phone, don\\'t you? Don\\'t you? Don\\'t you? Who am I gonna get? Who am I gonna get? I\\'m gonna get those feet.  Hey, you, heyAnd she\\'s affordable. You go. I\\'ll wait. I\\'m totally gonna get you.  I\\'m gonna be late. Got to go? You cannot You can run, but you cannot hide from me. They are beautiful. Ah I\\'ve got a betta. Which is a fish.  Yes, I actually knew that? Heh. I\\'m gonna have to tell my brother that I saw you. He thinks that every girl he ever dated turned gay. How is he? How is everyone? Everyone still in Michigan? Yeah, they\\'re still in that  mile radius. Do you ever get back there or? Um Talk to them all the time. But with work and  Enjoy? Thank you.  Yeah. Goatee Man is long gone. Yeah, a little bit more my type now, I suppose. So how about you? Are you seeing anyone or? I get what I need. Oh, do tell. I\\'m just a boring old married lady. Well, he\\'s, uh He\\'s smart. Someone from work?  Where else? Mm. I dated someone from work once. But I don\\'t know, it got weird. It was claustrophobic and Well, yeah, I mean, we don\\'t see each other day-to-day, so Smart. So what, a broker? Actually, yeah, yeah. Does it ever get?  Get?I mean there must be certain things you can\\'t talk about? What are you doing? Here I thought we were just two old friends having a drink. We are.  Can I have the check, please? Sure. His name is Michael Connor. C-O-N-N-O-R. But I don\\'t know, maybe you already knew that. No, Naomi, I Okay, yes, I may have come across his name in the office as someone who Someone who? Deals with a lot of hedge funds. Yep. That\\'s what he does. Naomi How was drinks? She\\'s not gonna give us anything. Look. If we don\\'t have a good feeling about this one We don\\'t need warm, fuzzy fucking feelings, Frank. We need evidence. Did your friend in Compliance send anything over? Paperwork on Michael. Now, don\\'t go doing anything rash. You\\'re not in Narcotics anymore. He\\'s an old friend. The man is a top guy Just watch me and don\\'t jump in a lot. Okay.  Okay, and nod? All right.  Michael? Hey.  How are you? Cory.  How are you? Good to see you? Working with us for a while. We figure it\\'s time he played with the big boys. Gentlemen. Uh, could I get a Macallan 18?  No ice? Of course. I\\'ll have the same thing. So will he. Thanks.  Thank you? Thank you. What do you have for us? Nothing. I was just out of school when I met this guy. He didn\\'t even give a shit about the money. Just loves the fucking game of it. You know, he played like a pro. When I left, and I started a hedge fund he sent a hedgehog to my office. An actual hedgehog? Yeah, the box opens, there was a fucking rodent in my lap. Oh, God. Heh, heh. Where is that guy? What is it? Getting older? We\\'re all older. The regulations? Well Where are you going with this? Macallan. Thank you. Thanks. Now, we have a lot of capital to invest. And you\\'re gonna bring us something, yeah? I\\'m thinking privacy. Privacy? You with the green pens. Color of money.  Can you check that the B server was reset properly last night? Yeah, for sure. Did you call Dave over at V-Tech?  Yeah, of course? Good. Thank you. All right.  Good afternoon, everyone. We\\'d like to start off with a preliminary discussion of pricing.  Let\\'s do it. Where are we at? At this point we\\'re looking at a range of  to  a share. At 7. million a share that gives us a valuation of  million. Hang on just a minute. We have to get a billion-dollar valuation. We have looked at the comparables, Ed, and You said  to  in your pitch. You\\'ll leave tens of millions of dollars on the table. We can get at least 35. This is a balancing act. Raising money for your company while still promising our investors a deal for coming on board Look, you begged me for this IPO. Do you want me to call Channing Trust? I don\\'t actually remember begging. Does anybody else? No. So, what you want to avoid here, Ed, is a down Because we know what happened with your last IPO. I don\\'t think that\\'s relevant here. Oh. Ed. Ian. I believe our goal is to find the right number for all of us.  The number\\'s 35.Possibly. But you can think of it like a Like a party. We need to encourage people to show up to the party. It could be the best party in the world.  But if nobody shows upA party?  Um, I don\\'t really thinkNo, no, hang on. I get this. A party. Go on. With a  to  range, we\\'ll get people in the door. But if the party\\'s good enough  People will line up around the block? This is true. I like you. You know how to talk to people. I\\'ll party with you anytime. Okay, if we\\'re gonna sell  percent of the company now we should talk about our options moving forward. Yes, we should. Michael Connor? Uh Yes. I\\'m I\\'m sorry. Have we, um? No. Uh Samantha Ryan. U? S. Attorney\\'s Office. Oh, really? Well, I was just hoping we could have a brief chat. Sure. My idea of a perfect summer\\'s afternoon. Brief chat with a long-legged woman who might even be working for the FBI. How thrilling. I did not say FBI. And I\\'m not interested in you. Oh. How very disappointing. I\\'m interested in one of your clients, Benji Akers. Yeah, not sure how I can help you with that. My relationship with my clients is strictly confidential. Of course, but these hedge fund guys they always seem to have some way to stay out of trouble but they need someone like you from the big bank. Now, you have regulations and Compliance breathing down your throat. So if someone\\'s gonna take the fall it seems to me it\\'s gonna be you. Not Benji Akers. Take the fall for what? Could be anything. Merger last spring where some investors got a memo prematurely, or a couple of rogue trades  that Compliance flags as irregular? Ha-ha-ha. You have nothing on me, do you? How do you know that? Oh, this has been lovely. But why don\\'t you call me when you have just a little bit more leverage? Is that a challenge? If you like. Marin? Hi. I\\'m Naomi Bishop. I I\\'m heading the IPO.  Yeah, I know? Okay. Uh, I wanted to talk to you in the office. They said you were leaving for the day. You guys talk to every single employee? You seem particularly interested in our process. In my experience, that usually means you have something you want to say to us. All right. What happens when Cachet gets hacked? Hacked? It\\'s anonymized and encrypted at every level. Yeah, you haven\\'t met my ex. We were beta testing. It was actually kind of helpful. We plugged all the holes, but He\\'ll keep trying.  There will probably be others? Others? What do you mean? What do you mean what do I mean? That\\'s what we do for a challenge. The naked photos, who knows? All right, it\\'s called a man-in-the-middle attack. So users want to be able to access the network on multiple devices, obviously. But that opens up the possibility of somebody implanting malware on the key server. Uh, does Ed know about this? Yeah, I tried to tell him, and he said that I was paranoid. Funny, when a company built on paranoia thinks that I\\'m the one who\\'s paranoid. He\\'s a total prick. I\\'m the best coder, and he treats me like I don\\'t exist and dismisses everything that I have to say. I cannot work at this company anymore. I need to sell my shares.  Okay? Help me do that? No. No, I don\\'t do that. I don\\'t think you understand. I have other stuff I can do with my time. I\\'m planning on starting a hacker space. We\\'re just waiting on I got to go. This is useless.  They\\'re going public very soon? I heard that\\'s a rumor.  Yeah? Have you always wanted to be CEO?  I would want to be CEO? No, actually.  Really? I don\\'t know. I mean I can always use more high tops.  Well, yeah. Ha, ha? Everyone needs  That\\'s not what I would buy? Tasmanian sea trout? Yummy. Hi, Naomi. Hello, Edward.  Take a seat? Thank you. Ed are you ready to be the rock star of this road show? Because people, they\\'re gonna want to tear this hoodie off of you. Oh, yeah. I just wanted to make sure that we\\'re in good shape  before I take off for New York? Oh. I\\'m in very good shape. Excellent. I just have one question for you. It\\'s probably not a big deal but something did come up during due diligence. A rumor started that your network, as encrypted as it is might be vulnerable still to a certain kind of hacker.  Sounds like you met Marin? Yes, actually. And I was interviewing employees and Unfortunately, our business can attract some colorful characters. Right. But you need to make sure that your employees are as much a firewall as your code. Look. I can promise you we\\'ve never been hacked. Okay. In theory, there\\'s a back door to everything. But we stay one step ahead. That\\'s the game. Good. That\\'s what I wanted to hear. Well, you two enjoy your dinner, and it\\'s on me. I should go.  This was fun. I\\'ll call you tomorrow? Sure. Naomi? Do you need me to look into this? I can totally take care of things here. Well, you seem to be taking care of Ed. I\\'m just trying to preserve the relationship. Okay, good. So maybe you can find a way to get him to sign an indemnity clause, because if there is any vulnerability for our investors here, we cannot be liable. I\\'ll handle it. When Ed hits on you, which he may have already whatever you do with that, that\\'s your business. But you have to handle him professionally and very, very gently. Okay? Yeah. I know how this works. Good. Excellent. Nice dress. What the fuck happened this time?  What do you mean? I got a call from Ed. It appears you\\'ve managed to rub him the wrong way. I I was doing my due diligence. You can\\'t push too hard. Cachet provided you with all the necessary documents.  WellEd feels like you lack confidence in his IPO! No one wants to be told they have an ugly baby! What is the fucking problem? There is no problem. It\\'s a beautiful fucking baby and I have absolute confidence in this IPO. Terrific. Great. So are we done here? Because I\\'ve got a road show to launch.  You pissed off Ed? Wait.  I pissed off Ed? What happened? I told you you have to treat a guy like that very, very gently. What happened was I got him to sign the indemnity clause. Wait.  You did? Yeah because I handled him very, very gently. Well good work. Thank you. Cachet is not a social network with privacy settings. We\\'re a privacy company that can build a social network. You guys want in on this now. I know the experts are impressed by your encryption but what if I\\'m a hacker and I break into your server? Well, that\\'s why we use end-to-end encryption. Unencrypted content is never on the server.  Don\\'t forget about ephemeral storage? This thing\\'s gonna explode.  You want to get in now? Dude, my dad keeps texting me.  He wants a piece of Cachet? Heh. We\\'re here to talk about human connection in the digital age. People crave this connection. But they don\\'t want Big Brother tracking their every move. They don\\'t want the NSA monitoring pictures of their kids. That\\'s where we come in. Hey, do any of the hotels in London have pools? I\\'ll find us a pool, hold on.  Last time in London, I was wasted? Yeah, I remember. Trying to do your accent for that chick. I\\'m gonna be someone\\'s American boy. You know as well as I do social media has overtaken the world. There\\'s Facebook, there\\'s Instagram, there\\'s Snapchat, there\\'s Twitter and if you are anything like me privacy is the most important thing. Knowing that nobody can get that information about you.  That\\'s the word. Security and safety? All right.  Yo, we should rent a car? Are we not getting cars? I\\'m thinking Ferrari, man. Yeah, do that, see what Naomi says. Coming in on your left here, pal. Gonna want to get in on this early. Oh, my God, thank you so much. That\\'s so sweet. This is the genius of Cachet. They allow you to engage in that social media world but it is locked down. It is airtight. Big smiles. We\\'re gonna make a lot of money. Hey, Bankerchick. Welcome home. If you\\'re done with room service how does homemade truffle pasta sound? Hey, how\\'d we do with the wiretap? Okay. Keep me posted. I\\'m gonna get these fuckers. Five minutes! Well, hello there. Thank you, Mike. Naomi. John. So you want to play? Because I didn\\'t spend all those Sundays working on your swing so you just ride around in a golf cart. You want me to play in this? Oh, yeah, you\\'d never pass the dress code. Heh. Well, you can take care of that. You own the place. Yeah, well, yeah, I had to do something. And now I am bored out of my fucking mind. And now she\\'s backpedaling. She won\\'t give me anything concrete. And on paper? Everything looks perfect. Our I? T. guys at Remson tested it. They say this network is as airtight  as anything they\\'ve ever seen? So, what\\'s the problem? There\\'s just this nagging feeling that after Dynacorps John, I just don\\'t want to make the wrong move here. Well, that sounds like fear. And that\\'s not the same thing as instinct. You know why this business is a young person\\'s game? It\\'s the lack of doubt. So you think I should keep it going? I\\'m not gonna tell you what to do, Naomi. But if the numbers check out, then it sounds like what we\\'re talking about is a rumor here. And rumors, they\\'re the wild card. You can\\'t control them. And once you let them inside your head well, you\\'re fucking lost. Yeah. God, it must be nice.  Not to have to give a shit anymore? Oh. Well, I never gave a shit. Come on. Can I ask you a question? What would you have done if I got pregnant when I was working for you? Would you have kept pushing for me?  Of course.\"Of course.\" What else are you gonna say? Woo-hoo.   Is everything okay? Mm-hm. I\\'m ready now. Can you believe it? No. This is Erin. Hello? Hello? I can\\'t get a signal in here.  Hon? It\\'s that woman I told you about. Her company might invest big in Cachet and She might tell you to enjoy your ultrasound. Okay. Olives, not twist. Thank you. It\\'s good to see you again. All right, take care. Thank you. Hi. I\\'m sorry, have we, um? Have we met? I feel like, uh Um I\\'m not sure.  Sam? Cory. Hey. So lovely. I feel like it was a cocktail thing downtown  Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah. Have a seat. You were talking about your work. And you were talking about how it\\'s, um, wait Titans Fund?  Is that?Titanite.  Yeah! Titanite!Yeah. And you were talking about how it\\'s, like, super intense. And how you always have to get a little something extra Wait, you called it something. Um What did you say? Edge? Is that right? Yeah. Exactly, yeah. I remember that vividly.  Yeah? Yeah. Happy birthday. Yeah. Very cute.  I don\\'t know. Looks like it\\'sHa-ha-ha. Looks like it could be a little soft though, huh? How\\'s everything looking with the IPO schedule? Look solid? I\\'m working on it. You need a little Botox? Little Little eye lift? Hey. No, it\\'s I know a guy. I\\'ll bear that in mind. You remember my cousin Evan?  PJ Ellis? Well, not anymore. After  years, yeah. Didn\\'t make the numbers, so they pushed him out. Thirty years, huh? Fuck. Yeah. Now he\\'s knocking on my door. Like I\\'m gonna hire him. Fucking tragedy. Nurse! Ha-ha-ha. That\\'s amazing. I can\\'t even, like, balance my own checkbook. It\\'s very simple when you think about it.  Just math? I know. What\\'s wrong with me? No, I remember last time you were telling me about, um, you Your work and, uh Oh, yes! You did this clinical trial or something.  I don\\'t remember the details? We talked about that? Yes. We were a little loose-lipped  if you know what I mean? Oopsie. But no, yeah. You were telling me how you talked to the scientist  and everything andYeah. I remember it because, um, it was about MS and my mom has that. Oh, yeah, no, I remember, yeah. Sorry, yeah. Yeah, um And the scientist, he was some big deal. I\\'d read about him. Doctor  Dr. SUh, Dr. Sobel.  Yes? Yeah.  Dr. Sobel? Right.  Sobel? He told you. And that\\'s how you got the edge. Shh. Shh.  You have to call me? Yeah, I sure do.  Promise? Yeah, I promise.  Teddy, hey. I\\'m just seeing these last-minute bids. What else we got? Xandos and Redding are upping the orders. This thing is getting hot. Good work. Keep them coming.  Thank you, Gloria? Do you need anything else? No, I\\'m good, thank you. Is everything okay? Of course. You know, I think I\\'m gonna finish up at home. Good night. Go, go, go.  Fuck. Naomi, it\\'s Erin. Call me when you get this. It\\'s important.  Hi? Hey. Did you get in okay? Yeah. We need to talk about that e-mail.  Do you ever relax? Heh.  Have a drink? I\\'d love to. But there are a million things going on tomorrow.  AndThis place does an amazing martini.  Uh, Ed? Mm. We\\'ve got to keep our eye on the ball here. Yeah.

More? Okay. One. Harder, one. One. You know, we\\'re gonna change it up. Greene and Broome.  Hi? Hey. I\\'m sorry, so sorry, to bother you. I\\'m just wondering if Naomi is here. Uh, no. No, she\\'s not. No. Yeah, sorry. Just something came up at work. I couldn\\'t get ahold of her, so I thought maybe She\\'s not at her place? No. I\\'m sorry for showing up here like this. No, no, no. It\\'s Hey, it\\'s fine. Uh, I was just about to have a glass of wine. Want one?  Really? Yeah.  Well, come on, come in? I don\\'t want to interru Please, come on in. Okay. Thanks.

I\\'m not gonna ask you where else you think she might spend her nights. We\\'re all grown-ups here. This is nice. You said you were having trouble at work, huh?  With Cachet? Yeah. It\\'s just that I actually can\\'t get into it. No, no, no, of course. But if you wanted to talk about it talk it through, you know, you could always use hypotheticals, you know? And Naomi did mention that she\\'d hit some kind of snag with due diligence. Naomi said that? Yeah. Well, she didn\\'t go into details, obviously. You know, we like to think that it\\'s, uh It\\'s helpful, you know, talk things through, find a different perspective. You\\'re telling me Naomi brings you across the wall? Not officially, no. Come on, sit down. Those shoes must be killing you. You\\'re quite the gentleman. But, you know, Naomi told me you always have an agenda. Yes, well She would. Heh. You know, Erin, everyone has an agenda. You\\'re trying to make promotion. You know that. I know that. You do good work. You kiss up to Naomi. And then you keep hoping that this year will be the one. And if it\\'s not the one, then eventually you have to start thinking about other avenues. You seem to think I\\'m gonna be giving you some information about my IPO. We both know how How these things happen. You know, Erin, I\\'ve been working at Remson a very long time. It might surprise you, but people there respect my opinion.  Hi? I just got your messages. What kind of problem do we have? Naomi, can you just hang on Hang on a sec.  Erin? Hold on. \"Hold on\"? Don\\'t tell me to hold on. I\\'m your boss. What the hell happened this time? Wait, are you still with Ed? No. I\\'m at my place. Okay, so Erin, I need to know what\\'s going on here. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, so Ed did let go of a few people last week. Yes, that was the recommendation. And? I know, but one of them was Marin. Are you fucking kidding me? She is a liability if she starts making claims about holes in the network. I know. Look, I got her number here. Marin Gold. Okay, hang on. Go.   0192. Got it. Well, Erin, hasn\\'t this been lovely? What are you gonna do? With what? You fired Marin? Now? Look, it wasn\\'t my call. Everything is your call. But we\\'ve got it under control. She got a very nice severance and Legal had her sign all kinds of shit. Ed, I am extremely concerned about this.  I wish you had consulted me beforeHey, Naomi, news flash: I don\\'t work for you.  I\\'mLet me tell you something. These doubts and second-guessing, I\\'m getting tired of it.  We\\'ve got orders pouring in? Yeah, because I\\'ve been doing my job. But it is also my job to be thorough. Oh, yeah?  I thought it was your job to be inspiring? You know, Ed  All right, hungry? Let\\'s go.  Where you been? Sorry, something came up at work.  Hello. Fuck you! This must be Cory. I Googled you! Of course you did. You\\'re a fucking prosecutor? I\\'m eager to hear more about your contact with Dr. Sobel.  You can talk to my lawyer!I look forward to it. We both know your client crossed a line. Heh. Would you look at him? He works  hours a week. He\\'s a dad, raises money for leukemia research.  I meanOh, I\\'m sorry. Does he plant daffodils too? Well, he\\'s got no history. He\\'s never been flagged by you guys or the SEC. Are you saying he doesn\\'t know any better? I have year-old twins who know better. When you, your boss and your friends decide to sabotage a company when you have information that Joe Investor couldn\\'t possibly have, and you use that information to profit while Joe Investor loses  percent of his retirement fund  you know better? Are you gonna charge my client or not? That depends. He\\'s not the one you want. There are bigger fish at Titanite. That\\'s the point. And he\\'s willing to cooperate? I\\'d like to thank you all for your patience as we\\'ve been processing this tremendous surge in orders from institutional investors. Our book is closed, and we have our offering price. Thirty-five. We just raised $ million? Congratulations. We\\'ll see how the market trades tomorrow, but I feel very confident.  Great, great? Good work. Hm? Where did you get that pen? I don\\'t know. Big pain in the ass.  Hey? Hey. Cory and I were taking bets on how much you\\'d spend on my birthday present. To many more. Nice. What are you drinking? Like a porcupine? Hedgehog, but cute, fuzzy. Get it? Hedge fund, money hog.  It\\'s aYeah, I get it. And Benji took it with him?  Yep? So what does the hedgehog mean? I don\\'t know what it means. It\\'s a hedgehog. These guys just fuck with each other. Probably doesn\\'t mean anything. So, am I done? Are you fucking kidding me? We own you.   Hello? Marin, it\\'s Naomi Bishop. Do you understand what\\'s happening here? Cachet can sue you. No, they said they would take care of that. Who? Who did? Are they paying you? Marin, you need to tell me who I\\'m sorry, I have to go. Marin.  Hello? Get me a car to Brooklyn, South Slope.   Hi. I\\'m Naomi. I\\'m a friend of Sam\\'s. Nice shoes. Is she home? Come on. I\\'ll get her. Thank you. Hello there. You must be Sophie and And William, right? I don\\'t talk to strangers. Oh. Right. Yeah. Well, it\\'s really your friends that\\'ll stab you in the back, so  Hey. UhOh. What\\'s up? I I want you to tell me what you know about Michael. You\\'ve been investigating him? I can\\'t really comment on that. Somebody leaked a rumor about my IPO. We go public tomorrow, and somebody I know. The tech blogger who posted the story he\\'s an old friend of Michael\\'s from Stanford. It had to be him, right? Do you think it was? Look, as far as this IPO goes we have no specific link to Michael at this time. Except you. Wait, are you saying I gave him information? I am not saying anything. I should go. Naomi, wait. I can help you.  Okay, did Michael have access? He did not get this from me. Do you understand? That is not who I am. Fuck. Are you tanking my IPO? Should I be? Don\\'t fuck with me, Michael. Don\\'t fuck with me now. Did you leak this thing? Is it true? It doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s fucking true!  You know that. Once the rumors startHey, hey. Start your own rumors. Do you know how to play this game? What the fuck is wrong with you? What did you do? Did you take my phone? Are you wearing a wire? What do you think? Let\\'s take our clothes off and find out. Jesus. It\\'s all just a big game to you, isn\\'t it? What else is there? Hey, listen, whatever happens tomorrow you\\'re gonna be fine. Fuck, I don\\'t want to be fine! I was never supposed to be fine! I was supposed to be a motherfucking rainmaker.  No, that\\'s No, that\\'s for PR to handle. They have a long reach. So Hold No. Wait. Hold on. Tell Ed not to make a public statement, okay? I appreciate his enthusiasm, but just Look, wake the fuck up and call me. So this is a big day for you and your shareholders.  Absolutely? Now, over the last  hours reports have surfaced that show hackers may be attempting to access this secure network. So here\\'s the thing. When people hear the word \"hackers,\" they get scared. We\\'re not scared of hackers. We employ hackers.  You employ hackers? What Heh. I think what Ed means is that there\\'s never been a security breach of our network. I\\'d like to take this moment to personally reassure our investors. This morning, I uploaded three photos to my own profile on the Cachet network. These photos are of a highly personal nature, you know what I mean? Never been a security breach. If anyone thinks they can access my photos  I say go ahead, give it a try? Well, that certainly should be compelling for the investors out there. Fuck. Coffee, miss? Titanite accounts for the last five years. Deals where someone may have known a little something extra.  Hello? Is this Samantha Ryan? Yeah. Who\\'s this? Hi. It\\'s Neera calling from Bane Recruiting. I have a position that will triple your salary. Yeah, I would love to hear more, but I\\'m gonna have to call you back. Call me when you get a chance. That sounds great. Thanks. So? Which bank? What, you never been called by a headhunter before? Don\\'t you know that\\'s why they call this place \"the departure lounge\"? I\\'m the only sucker who\\'s been here more than a decade. So why do you stay? Uh Well, it ain\\'t for the paycheck. Just do me one favor before you talk to those guys, okay? You\\'ve been on a trading floor, right? No? Honey, you got to go there. You got to see what we\\'re up against. You go, you breathe it in. The hunger of it, the pure American desire. Five minutes before the opening bell and all anyone wants to know is where Cachet will open. It is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most highly anticipated IPOs of the year. Hey, we\\'ve got FBA at  percent, Xandos at 10.  What have we got of foreign? Tioros for 15. China for 20.  Rex Brothers is in for  percent? I\\'ve got Cabreau Fund for 10.  Milton Group wants 15.Good.  Gonna have Boon Portfolio in a minute? Okay. And there is the opening bell. Shares of the privacy company Cachet begin trading today. The question now is when they will start trading and at what price. I\\'ve got a bid for K at 32. One mil at 30.  Okay, are we close? Almost there.  Let\\'s get there? We got Redding in for  percent. Hey, hey, hey, wait, no.  Boon is out? What?  What are you talking about? Boon\\'s hitting the exits. Milton Ellis is pulling out too. Fuck. Okay. Okay. Jonathan, we need to anchor this thing right now. Is there a problem? No. No problem.  We\\'re finishing the share allocation? People are pissing themselves.  When are we gonna open? Any minute now. What\\'s the holdup? What\\'s our fucking price? We\\'re in the  to  range. How the fuck did that happen? Erin, meet me in the lobby. Yeah, we need someone up here. What\\'s gonna happen up there? I don\\'t know. Hopefully the rumors will die down Did you leak this? I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. I know you were with Michael. I was not with Michael. I don\\'t give a shit about that, okay? I want to know why you sabotaged this. What the fuck did you do?  I didn\\'t do anything? Yes, you did. You did, because you needed it, right? You don\\'t know what I need.  Hello? You need to look into Erin Manning my VP on this deal.  Naomi? She had contact with Michael.  I will do that? Good. You hearing about this? We got to pull out. Get us out of this thing now! Mikey. What are you wearing? Hold on. I think my Lyft is here. Talk to me. Where are we? We\\'re about to find out. But keep me posted. Hey, listen, when we\\'re done, we should talk. And there it is. We have Cachet opening at $ a share. That is well down from the IPO price. Cachet\\'s investors won\\'t be happy. I got to be honest, I don\\'t know that Are you fucking kidding me? Get the desk. They better be buying. expecting a pop on the first day Start buying. Start buying! Yes, now.  Oh, jeez. Got no ask. Where\\'s the fucking bottom on this one? Yeah, hi. I, um I just have a quick question. I want to know who the fuck thinks they\\'re gonna make money off this train wreck. I want you to wait for it. I want it at 22. Twenty-two? Here.  No. No, get that out of my face? You haven\\'t eaten anything all day. Your concern is truly almost authentic, but I I would like one of those.  Yeah? Go. Hang on. We got bids coming in. Titanite is buying. What the hell is? Come on, talk to me!  Hey, hey, Mikey? Hey, how are you doing? Yeah, no, I\\'m just real proud of you.  We\\'ll make a lot of money? You in town? I\\'m off to the Hamptons. South. The real Hamptons. Naomi? What is this?  That is theYou said you wanted it. How many chocolate chips are in my cookie?  Um, heh? Did anyone teach you basic math? Count the fucking chips. Three. Three. Yes. And your cookies, I saw them, and they were oozing with chocolate and my cookie has three motherfucking chips?  Let\\'s look at the day that just happened. Cachet, priced at a very healthy and confident $ a share stumbled at the open to $. flopped by the end of the day priced at Let me make sure I get this right, $23.74. That is definitely not $ a share. That\\'s about a third of its value erased on the first day. Cachet not having a good open. Okay, we know that Titanite was the only buyer of those shares, right? You know how this story goes. A few days pass, they get this Marin to retract her statement the stock rallies, and they clean up.  Call your friend in Compliance? Not happening. Get her to get us the personnel file for Erin Manning. She\\'s not gonna do that.  Why? Because she\\'ll lose her job. You got to let go of this.  Compliance is asking for you. Got it. Okay, thanks. Okay.  Hi? I know you\\'re familiar with the regulations that keep the investment banking transactions  separate from the sales and trading? Of course. Did you have contact with Michael Connor three days before the Cachet offering? Uh I\\'m sorry. Do I need a lawyer or? Well, essentially, we are your lawyers.  For the moment? Right. I spoke to Michael that night briefly about a colleague.  You didn\\'t discuss the Cachet deal? No. I\\'m sure Michael would tell you the same thing. Michael Connor no longer works at the firm. He moved to Titanite.   That was him? Your new global head? Look at me. Have the respect to look me in the fucking eye and tell me if that man out there is my new boss. The department needs a new face. Don\\'t give me that. You lost control of the story. Cachet will rally, just like Facebook. Naomi, it\\'s like I told you. This just isn\\'t going to be your year. When is my year? Hm? When is it my fucking year? Naomi?  Did you see her? Heh. Nobody wants to say goodbye. So, what happens to the rest of us? Well, apparently Erin is moving up in the world. My uncle called me this morning and asked about you. He\\'s got some huge deal coming up. Wanted to know if you give  percent because he said this thing would be your whole life. So I told him you were a pro. Congratulations. Thank you. I\\'m surprised you called back because you have a reputation for being a bit unorthodox. I get the job done. However I can. This would be a big transition for you.  Yeah? Coming over into the corporate world. The thing is, I have a family and I\\'m looking forward to having a sense of stability and to really be a You know what? No. Um That\\'s not it. Uh The truth is I want to make some money. I could say something more nuanced about my dreams and aspirations, but that\\'s the honest truth. I am so glad that we can sit here as women and talk about ambition. But money doesn\\'t have to be a dirty word. We can like that too. disappointment initially Finally today tech company Cachet is back in the spotlight with another surge in share price this week, as the stock continues to rally following a disappointing IPO. Cachet, whose stock has been steadily climbing after that terrible debut earlier this year has by now made a lot of its investors very wealthy if they were able to hold on tight during that steep drop. saw this with Facebook and Square where a stock rallies and the IPO fades into the distance as investors track the growth of the company over time. What seemed like a disaster at the initial offering could turn out to be just a speed bump on the road to enormous gains.'),\n",

Come on, Eric? Come on, Will? Rogers? I\\'m not going to say, you know? You know me? Robertson? That cunt. I knew it. I knew I shouldn\\'t have fucking gone to her last year. It wasn\\'t anyone. Eric, you know what it was? It was bad luck, and that\\'s all it was. Yup- Yup- All right, well, good luck. Will? Come here. I was just in the middle of a lot of shit right here that I think somebody needs to take a look at. Eric, listen, they\\'re telling us everybody needs to get out of here. Just leave their stuff.

Well, make sure they\\'re all out there. I\\'ve gotta say something. Yeah, no, they\\'re ready. They\\'re ready for you. All right, let\\'s hear it. You\\'re all still here for a reason. 480% of this floor was just sent home, forever. We spent the last hour saying our goodbyes. They were good people and they were good at their jobs, but you were better. Now they\\'re gone, they\\'re not to be thought of again. This is your opportunity.

Hey, be glad you\\'re still alive. I am.  Have a good night, man? You, too. Come on. Come on. Come on. We\\'re sorry. You\\'ve reached a number..  Fuck me. Fuck!that has been disconnected.  Hello? Hey.  I can\\'t hear you? What? Can you go outside? It\\'s too loud. Hold on a second. It\\'s loud. Just give me a second.  All right, what\\'s up? Hey, where are you?  Lugo? Okay. Are you with Will?  Yeah. Will Emerson? Yeah. Yeah. I think he\\'s still here. Why? All right. I need you to get Will, and I need you guys to come back up here.  Where? To the office.  What? I\\'m serious. Wait a sec You want me to get our boss\\' boss out of a club and bring him back to the office at 10: on a Thursday night? Well, our boss got axed, so technically he is our boss,  and yes, that is what I want you to do? Why? Look, man. Just trust me, okay? I need you guys back here now. All right. We\\'ll be there in 10. Fuck. Have I ever told you how much I love your bag? No, really.  Do you have a little dress that matches it? Yeah, I do. Because you could bounce around in it like a fucking girl. Hey! Look who\\'s burning the candle at both ends. Why didn\\'t you come out with us? There\\'s no more cuts planned. You don\\'t have to kiss my arse. I frankly don\\'t even know what it is you guys do. Well, I\\'m really sorry I had to bring you guys back here,  butThat\\'s all right.  What\\'s going on? Look at this.  Eric gave me this file before he left? Eric Dale. And he told me that he couldn\\'t quite figure it out. And the last thing he said to me before the elevator doors closed was, \"Be careful.\"  He said, \"Be careful\"?Yeah. So, obviously, I\\'m a little curious. I start to get into it a little bit, and I realize that the only thing that he\\'s missing  This is not good, Will? All right. Okay. So what is he doing here? No, no. Go to model four. It makes more sense. Okay. All right. What is this? This is basically everything that we have in our books at any given time. But, what Eric was trying to do was to work these numbers for levels of volatility that fall outside of the standard VAR model.  What are those levels? it\\'s fairly complicated. Simplify. The volatility levels are set using historic patterns, basically, and then stretching those patterns out another 10, 15% roughly. All right, so? So, we are starting to test those historic patterns. When?  Today? Tuesday. Monday. Last Friday and Wednesday. Two Fridays ago. All right. I get it. Fuck me. Once this thing gets going in the wrong direction, this is fucking huge. How huge? Well, the losses are greater than the current value of the company. Projected losses. The projected losses, Will.  And this is just our floor? Yes. Where the fuck is Eric Dale? I don\\'t know. I tried to call him. His phone is off. What do you mean? They turned everybody\\'s phone off that they axed today. Fucking ruthless.  Did you try his personal cell? Yeah, I called his cell phone. it\\'s not on.  Call his home? At this hour? Yeah. Do we even know if he\\'s right?  Looks pretty fucking right to me? It does. Mrs. Dale, it\\'s Will Emerson. I\\'m fine, thank you. May I speak with Eric? No, we\\'ve tried that. His phone appears to be off. Listen, could you have him call me the moment he comes in? The moment he walks through the door. Thank you so much. Goodbye. Where the fuck is he?  Doesn\\'t he have, like, three kids? So? Fuck, I don\\'t know, would you go home? I know where he is. I need you two to go and get him. There will be a car waiting for you downstairs.  You need to go? Right now? Yeah, right now. What are you going to do? I\\'m going to call Sam. Fuck me.  Yes? It\\'s Will. It\\'s 11: at night. I know. I\\'m sorry. I wouldn\\'t have called. What\\'s the problem? I think you need to get back here. What? Sam, listen it\\'s 11: at night. I\\'m well aware of the fucking time, Sam. I\\'m telling you, you need to see this. See what? It\\'s E-mail it to me. I don\\'t think that, that would be a good idea. I\\'m on my way. Look at these people. Wandering around with absolutely no idea what\\'s about to happen. Right? Well, I try to not let work get to me like that. I\\'ve noticed that about you. Come on. We\\'re  years old.  I\\'m 28.All right, 28. Whatever, it\\'s the same thing, but I made nearly a quarter of a million dollars last year. Fuck. For what? I push numbers around on a computer screen. A bunch of glorified crack addicts are willing to take that information, and they pretend to understand it, and they bet it against some other jock halfway around the world who, you know, if he wasn\\'t doing this, he\\'d be in an OTB somewhere, putting it all on number seven, you know? At the end of the day, one guy wins, one guy loses. You do know it\\'s a little more complicated than that, right? Yeah. It\\'s Will. He wants to know if we found him. What do I say? Let\\'s say that we haven\\'t found him yet. Okay.  Hey? Hey. So? Eric Dale. Oh, Jesus. Before he leaves the building, escorted by fucking security, by the way  I had nothing to do with that? I know. I\\'m sorry. Go on. Before he leaves the building, he hands this disk to Peter Sullivan.  Who\\'s Peter Sullivan again? Doesn\\'t matter.  He\\'s one of Eric\\'s guys? All right. But before the elevator doors are closing, the lest thing that he says is, \"Be careful.\" \"Be careful\"? Yeah.  \"Be careful\"?Yeah.  Why? Take a look. Oh, Jesus. You Know I can\\'t fucking read these things. Just speak to me in English. All right. Basically, this Kid, Peter Sullivan, he gets all inspired by your pep talk. Nice job, by the way. And he delves straight in after work. And I think he nailed it. Nailed it? Yeah, I think he figured out what Eric was missing. And? It\\'s not good, Sam. These here are the historical volatility index limits which, of course, our entire trading model relies on pretty fucking heavily. Well, we\\'re now so levered up that once it gets outside of these limits, it gets ugly in a hurry. And how close to those limits have we gotten? Sam, we\\'re beyond close. We broke through these limits five or six days in the last two weeks. Now, somehow we\\'ve managed to stay on the right side of it for now. For now. Well, look what happens when we get on the wrong side of it.  Wait a minute. What am I looking at? You\\'re looking at this figure here.  Whoa. Is thatYeah. And that would not be a bad day for us, historically speaking.  Is that figure right? I don\\'t know. I can\\'t be sure. Where\\'s Eric Dale?  We shut his phone off? Of course we did. Yeah. So I called his wife, who says he\\'s not home. Yeah, he\\'s probably crying in some fucking beer somewhere. Yeah, or worse. Where\\'s the kid that did this? I sent him out looking for Eric. You think he knows what he\\'s doing? I don\\'t know. What do I know? Get him back here. Get him back here. What do you think these girls make in a night?  ,500? Two grand? Two grand. Fuck. That\\'s That\\'s pretty great. I mean, all considered. Shit. Will. Yep- No. No, we asked, and nobody\\'s seen him. Okay, yep. All right, so what do you think Rogers makes in a year?  I don\\'t know, I have no idea? Come on. Play along.  What year? I don\\'t know? Last year. Three quarters of a million. Come on.  What? Oh, it\\'s not even close.  More? Much more. A million? Will Emerson made two and a half million last year.  Fuck you? Fuck me. Fuck you. How do you know that?  He told me? He just told you? I asked him, and yeah, he told me. You think that\\'s true? Yeah, probably. That\\'s fucked up.  Why is that fucked up? I don\\'t know, does it seem right to you? Right? I mean, right is Right is Jesus. So what do you think that means Rogers puts away? I have no idea, Seth. This traffic is a fucking nightmare. Sorry. Gentlemen. Will. Mr. Rogers. Come with us, please. Sam, this is Seth Bregman and Peter Sullivan. Sir. Will? Where are we going? We\\'re going to get a second opinion on your work, Peter. So, Sam, what do you have for us? It\\'ll be here in a minute. Finding somebody in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge. Okay, let\\'s go right into the introductions. This is Sarah Robertson, who you know. Chief Risk Management Officer Ramesh Shah from upstairs. And David Horn, one of the firm\\'s in-house counsel. Nice to meet you all. This is my Head of Trading, Will Emerson, and this is Peter Sullivan and Seth Bregman. They work in our Risk Department. Where\\'s Eric Dale? He was let go today. Who do you have left in your Risk Department? As of today that would be Peter and our Junior Analyst, Seth. Really? Will Emerson? Yes, please. Just hand them out. Thank you. Apparently, Eric had been working on this for some time, but he wasn\\'t able to finish it. This morning, as he left the building, he handed the program to Peter here and asked him to take a look at it. Peter did. He put a few things in that Eric seemed to be missing, and this is what came out. Peter, is this your work? Mostly Mr. Dale\\'s. But is this your draft? Yes. Again, expanded on the original work by Mr. Dale. But, yes. What\\'s your background?  My background? Your CV? I\\'ve been with the firm for two and a half years, working with Eric that whole time. But I hold a doctorate in engineering, specialty in propulsion, from MIT with a bachelor\\'s from Penn. What is a specialty in propulsion, exactly? My thesis was a study in the ways that friction ratios affect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads. So, you\\'re a rocket scientist? I was. Yeah. Interesting. How did you end up here? It\\'s all just numbers, really. Just changing what you\\'re adding up. And to speak freely, the money here is considerably more attractive. What time is it? 32:15. Fuck me. Fuck me. And I\\'m guessing by the fact that you two haven\\'t said anything that the math checks out. Look, we\\'d need some time to go over this. But Mr. Sullivan here seems like he knows what he\\'s doing. So, it would appear we have a problem. Thank you for that. What time is it?  2:16.Fuck me. Fuck me. Sam, how long under normal operations would it take your people to clear that from our books? What?  All of it? Yes. I don\\'t know. Weeks.  Weeks? Yeah. Weeks. But you certainly know that our business is selling and buying? It doesn\\'t work for very long without both components. We suddenly stop buying for a day or two, that\\'s not something you can hide under the rug. That gets out. And when it does, this whole thing comes to an end, and right quick.  I understand? Do you? Yes. How many traders do we have left between your floor and Peterson\\'s?  I don\\'t know, what60. Jared, as I look at this more closely, it is these VAR numbers that are setting this thing off. Excuse me. I warned you about this last year. We would not be in this position if we had done what I Please. As I was saying, and I speak completely off the record, it\\'s only a matter of time before someone else starts putting these in and they come up with exactly the same results and look at exactly what we\\'re looking at right now, if they haven\\'t already. Understood. And, Sarah, what value would you allow to be placed on those assets that might remain on the books, if they had to? Why would they still be on the books? Because suddenly nobody wants to fucking buy them. Fuck you, Sam. Will you give me  a fucking break here? Excuse me, Jared Without an active market, it would take weeks or months for me to come up with an accurate value on them. You would have to go block by block. Look, Jared, it\\'s a very simple business, right? We talked about this. Sam. Will, Peter, and  What the fuck is his name? Seth. Thank you. Seth. Could you please give us a few moments? And, Peter? Has anyone else seen this? No, no one aside from us.  And Eric Dale? Yes. And can it really be possible that we don\\'t know where Eric Dale is? I called his wife, he hasn\\'t come home yet, and we turned off his phone today. Perfect. Well, I\\'d like to know where he is. Jesus fucking Christ. Who is that guy? Sam\\'s boss. He looks like he\\'s  years old. He\\'s 40. Yeah, how does that happen? Oh, it happens all the time. Except to me. Kid\\'s a fucking killer. What are they talking about in there? It ain\\'t pretty. What ain\\'t pretty? If people stop buying what we\\'re selling. Jared. You cannot be doing what you\\'re thinking of doing. Well, I don\\'t see any other choice. What does that mean, we don\\'t have a choice? Fuck you, you don\\'t have a choice. Fuck me? Did you even look at the numbers, Sam? Yeah, but what do I know? Correct me if I\\'m wrong, Mr. Shah, but these numbers, they don\\'t add up. One and one no longer makes two. Look, if I may, I would like a little bit more time. Jared, we can\\'t tell you yet. Are you fucking kidding me? We have talked about this. We need a little more time to give you our conclusion. Okay. We meet again in  minutes.  Sam, do you have the file? Yeah. What are you going to do? Are you gonna call him? I already have. Jesus. Wow, that\\'s gorgeous. It\\'s a long way down. Yes, it is. Will, don\\'t do that. Come on. You know the feeling that people experience when they stand on the edge like this isn\\'t a fear of falling. It\\'s the fear that they might jump. That\\'s very deep and depressing. Thank you. Yeah, well, I\\'m a little dark sometimes. All right. Come down, please, Will. Please, come on. Will. Yeah, fuck it. Not today! It looks like they\\'re going to make us dump this shit. What? You watch. How? You\\'ll see. How could they do that? They can\\'t. It\\'s impossible. But they\\'ll figure a way. I\\'ve been at this company for  years, and I\\'ve seen things you wouldn\\'t believe. When all is said and done, they do not lose money. They don\\'t mind if everybody else does, but they don\\'t lose. Will? Did you really make two and a half million last year? Yeah, sure. How did you spend it all? It goes quite quickly. You know, you learn to spend what\\'s in your pocket. Two and a half million goes quickly? All right, let\\'s see. So the taxman takes half up front, so you\\'re left with one and a quarter. My mortgage takes another  grand. I send  home for my parents, you know, keep them going.  So what\\'s that?800. All right, 800. Spent  on a car. About  on restaurants. Probably  on clothes.  I put  away for a rainy day? That\\'s smart. Yeah, as it turns out, \\'cause it looks like the storm\\'s coming. You still got 125. Yeah, well, I did spend $76, on hookers, booze, and dancers. But mainly hookers. 776, I was a little shocked initially, but then I realized that I could claim most of it back as entertainment. it\\'s true.  Holy shit!Goddamn! The cavalry is here! Come on, we should go. How old are you?  43.Jesus. This is bizarre. It\\'s like a dream. I don\\'t know, seems like we actually may have just woken up. Come in. How do we look?  I should go? No. You should stay. So? It\\'s legit. The kid killed it. The formula\\'s worthless.  What does that mean? It\\'s broken. There are eight trillion dollars of paper around the world relying on that equation. Well, we were wrong. No, you mean you were wrong. Now, don\\'t get me started. We discussed this. I\\'m heading for the conference room. No, I want you to hear this. I don\\'t want to hear this. How do you think I\\'ve stuck around this place so long? I called Tuld. Do we have a contingency plan here?  A contingency plan? Yes. No, we went all in on this one. So we\\'ve gotten ourselves quite exposed here, haven\\'t we? To Tuld or the market? To both. He\\'s here?  Tuld\\'s helicopter just landed? I know. Come with us.  Where\\'s Sam? I don\\'t know. You sure you want all of us? Yes. One piece of advice for everyone before we go in there. This could get a little ugly. But whatever you do, just tell the truth. No sugarcoating Do not change a word of it. No one here is smart enough, including the rocket scientist.  Mr. Cohen? Morning. This way, please. He\\'s already in there waiting for you. Excellent. John. Please, sit down. Welcome, everyone. I must apologize for dragging you all here at such an uncommon hour. But from what I\\'ve been told, this matter needs to be dealt with urgently. So urgently, in fact, it probably should have been addressed weeks ago. But that is spilt milk under the bridge. So, why doesn\\'t somebody tell me what they think is going on here? Mr. Tuld, as I mentioned earlier, if you compare the figure at the top of page . Jared, it\\'s a little early for all that. Just speak to me in plain English. Okay. In fact, I\\'d like to speak to the guy who put this together. Mr. Sullivan, is it? Does he speak English? Sir? I\\'d like to speak with the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess. Certainly. That would be Peter Sullivan. Right here. Oh, Mr. Sullivan, you\\'re here. Good morning. Maybe you could tell me what you think is going on here. And please, speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever. It wasn\\'t brains that got me here. I can assure you of that. Well, sir, as you may or may not know, I work here for Mr. Rogers as an associate in the Risk Assessment and Management Office at MBS. Please. Just relax. Stand up. Tell us in a clear voice. What is the nature of the problem? Okay. As you probably know, over the last  to  months the firm has begun packaging new MBS products that combine several different tranches of rating classifications in one tradable security. This has been enormously profitable, as I imagine you noticed. I have. The firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day. Now the problem, which is, I guess, why we are here tonight, is that is takes us, the firm, about a month to layer these products correctly, thereby posing a challenge from a Risk Management standpoint. And, Mr. Sullivan, that challenge is? We have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to. Yes. But the key factor here is these are essentially just mortgages. So that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing or allowed to do in any other circumstance, thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags. Now Thank you, Mr. Sullivan. Sit down. What I\\'m guessing your report here says, and give me some rope here. What I\\'m guessing it says is that considering the, shall we say, bumpy road we\\'ve been on the last week or so, that the figures your brilliant co-workers up the line ahead of you have come up with don\\'t make much sense anymore considering what\\'s taking place today. Actually, not what\\'s taking place today, but what\\'s already taken place over the last two weeks. So, you\\'re saying this has already happened? Sort of. Sort of. And, Mr. Sullivan, what does your model say that, that means for us here. Well, that\\'s where it becomes a projection. But You\\'re speaking with me, Mr. Sullivan. Well, sir, if those assets decrease by just 25% and remain on our books, that loss would be greater than the current market capitalization of this entire company. So, what you\\'re telling me is that the music is about to stop and we\\'re going to be left holding the biggest bag of odorous excrement ever assembled in the history of capitalism. Sir, I\\'m not sure that I would put it that way. But let me clarify. Using your analogy, what this model shows is the music, so to speak, just slowing. If the music were to stop, as you put it, then this model wouldn\\'t be even close to that scenario. It would be considerably worse. Let me tell you something, Mr. Sullivan. Do you care to know why I\\'m in this chair with you all? I mean, why I earn the big bucks? Yes. I\\'m here for one reason and one reason alone. I\\'m here to guess what the music might do a week, a month, a year from now. That\\'s it. Nothing more. And standing here tonight, I\\'m afraid that I don\\'t hear a thing. Just silence. So, now that we Know the music has stopped, what can we do about it? Mr. Cohen? Ms. Robertson? I\\'m afraid I think this is where you\\'re supposed to step back in. Lord knows we\\'ve relied enough on Mr. Sullivan tonight. What do you have for us? What have I told you since the first day you stepped into my office? There are three ways to make a living in this business, be first, be smarter, or cheat. Now, I don\\'t cheat. And although I like to think we have some pretty smart people in this building, it sure is a hell of a lot easier to just be first. Sell it all. Today. Is that even possible, Sam? Yes, but at what cost? I\\'ll have to pay. Really? I think so. Where is this going to come back to us? Everywhere. Sam, I don\\'t think you seem to understand what your boy here has just said. If I made you, how would you do this? You call the traders in for their normal : meeting and you be honest with them. Because they\\'re going to know it\\'s the end either way. You\\'re going to have to throw them a bone, and a pretty big one. And then you\\'ve got to come out of the gates storming. No swaps. No nothing. 440% done by 10:15. By 11:00, all your trades have to be gone because by lunchtime, word\\'s going to be out. And by 2: you\\'re going to be selling at  cents on the dollar, if you\\'re lucky. And then the feds are going to be in here, up your ass, trying to slow you down. Ramesh? They can slow you down. They can\\'t stop you. It\\'s yours to sell. But, John, even if we manage to pull that off, and that\\'s saying something, the real question is, who are we selling this to? Same people we\\'ve been selling it to the last two years, and whoever else will buy it. But, John, if you do this, you will kill the market for years. it\\'s over. And you\\'re selling something that you know has no value. We are selling to willing buyers of the current fair market price. So that we may survive. You will never sell anything to any of those people ever again. I understand.  Do you? Do you? This is it! I\\'m telling you. This is it. Now, it\\'s 4:00. Jared, you\\'ve got till 5: to break this down and draw me up a plan. Is there anybody else who knows what\\'s in here at the moment, block by block? Eric Dale. And where is he? As of today, he\\'s no longer with the firm. We have been trying to locate him.  Carmelo? Yes. Get me Eric Dale here by 6:30. It\\'s done. We meet back here in an hour. Sam, let\\'s talk. This is a hell of a town. I\\'ve always loved this place, since the day I arrived. Everything about it. Sam, are you going to go with me on this? I don\\'t know, John. This one is very ugly. You and I, we\\'re salesmen. We sell. That\\'s what we do. it\\'s not complicated. Exactly. And you know damn well you don\\'t sell anything to anybody unless you think they\\'re gonna come back for more. That\\'s the lesson we learned. And tomorrow, we\\'re done. But this is it, Sam. You keep saying that. What\\'s that supposed to mean? This is the big one. Most of us aren\\'t going to make it out of this one.  Us? The Street. What are you talking about? This isn\\'t the last situation I\\'m gonna have to deal with this week. This is just the start. It\\'s the start \\'cause you\\'re starting it. Maybe. But I don\\'t believe that. Not this time. The numbers, they just don\\'t add up anymore. I agree with you there. I\\'ve been saying that for years. If this kid out there can come up with this, then Look, I just don\\'t think I can walk in there knowing what I know and put the hammer down on these guys. When did you start getting so soft, Sam? Fuck you, soft. You\\'re panicking If you\\'re the first out of the door, that\\'s not called panicking. You\\'re obviously operating with more information than I have. But I think this will destroy this firm. No one will ever trust you again. You\\'re knowingly putting people out of business, full stop. You let me deal with that, Sam. How\\'d it go? This is a fucking shit show.  They\\'re gonna go with it? Probably. Jesus. Remember this day, boys. Remember this day. So, what\\'s the strategy here? That\\'s where I\\'m headed right now. Downstairs to work on it with my guys. No, no. You and I with John. I\\'m not sure that we need one, Sarah. That\\'s not the way I do things. Please. Listen, he knows where we\\'ve stood on this all along. That\\'s exactly my point. And knowing what was discussed by both you and I, I don\\'t see how this could provide you with anything other than a false sense of comfort. I\\'m not looking for a sense of comfort here, Sarah. I don\\'t think there\\'s one to be found. So, again, what\\'s the strategy here? I\\'m just not sure there\\'s much more to do on this. It\\'s very simple. Don\\'t even think about fucking me on this. 3\\'Cause if we\\'re going down, then you damn well know it\\'ll be together. No. I\\'m not sure that I do know that. Hey. Oh, I\\'m sorry. What do you guys think Tuld made last year? Would you shut the fuck up?  million. In bonuses and salary.  Really? Sure, it\\'s public record. That is a lot of fucking money. He was worth a billion. Was? Till today. Really? You\\'ll see. I\\'m going to get some coffee. You guys want anything else?  I\\'m all right? I could use some real air.  Probably a good idea? ls it all right, Will?  Is what all right? If I get out of here for a minute? Of course, it\\'s not a prison. You want me to hold your hand? Why did they put all this fruit on it? Hello, Will Emerson. Hello. Right. No, thank you. I understand. No, we\\'ll be discreet. Thank you.  What? Eric\\'s wife. He\\'s alive, he\\'s home, he doesn\\'t want to speak to us, and he doesn\\'t know that she rang me.  Where\\'s he live? Heights.  Shall I call Tuld\\'s guy? No. It\\'s Eric. The last thing we need is those guys going over there. No, you two go get him and try to bring him here.  But you got to be back by 6: a? m.All right. I hate Brooklyn. May I come in? Of course. Please, sit down. So We\\'re going to do this thing. Okay. It\\'s going to be tight. Is Sam on board? Not yet. Sarah, I need a head to feed to the traders on the floor and the board. Is it me or Cohen? It\\'s you. Of course, you\\'re well aware that I filtered several warnings to you and Cohen about this a year ago. I really don\\'t think that\\'s the best path for you to take at this point. You\\'re going to be well taken care of here. Obviously, it is quite complicated. John, I was told under no uncertain terms It was always a very gray area. Actually, it was made very clear at the time by you, me, and Cohen. I\\'d really appreciate it if you didn\\'t fight me on this. We all fucked this one up pretty good. Yes. We need you to stay here until this is finished and the market\\'s closed. I understand. They\\'ll go over the numbers with you downstairs. Good luck. Oh, fuck. Jared\\'s coming. What\\'s the boy wonder want?  You got a minute? Just off to pick up Eric. Yeah. I know. It will only take a second. All right, what is it? Tuld and I have concerns that Sam may not be willing to step up and do the right thing here. This has never been a problem. No, it hasn\\'t. But sometimes, in acute situations such as this, often what is right can take on multiple interpretations. Sam will step up. Oh, I know he will. But if he doesn\\'t But if he doesn\\'t, we need to know that you will. Thank you. You need to know that I will what? That you\\'ll step up. I have no doubt that Sam will make the right decision. But just to make it clear, he and I have always had the same interpretation of what\\'s right, no matter how acute the situation. Jesus, that\\'s a nice place. Yeah, it is. He just bought it. I hope it was with cash. Fuck me, you\\'re a heartless little shit sometimes. And it wasn\\'t. Don\\'t touch any of the buttons.  What are you doing here? Hey. So, Peter finished the model you were working on. Really? It caused a shit storm. I bet it did. You think he\\'s right? I know he\\'s right. Fuck. All right. So Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting with the senior partners last night. And based on your findings, they\\'ve decided to liquidate our entire position. Today. I\\'m very sorry about that. They\\'re worried about you being out here and they want me to bring you back. Please. I\\'m just saying.  Fuck them. Fuck them? Eric  Don\\'t be rash? Forget it. I signed my paper. I\\'m out.  They\\'ll pay you? They got nothing on me. They\\'ll pay you. I\\'ve been paid enough already. Fuck. Do you know I built a bridge once?  Sorry? A bridge. No, I didn\\'t know that. I was an engineer by trade. It went from Dilles Bottom, Ohio, to Moundsville, West Virginia. It spanned  feet above the Ohio River. 612, people use this thing a day. And it cut out  miles of extra driving each way between Wheeling and New Martinsville. That\\'s a combined 847, miles of driving a day. Or 25,410, miles a month. And 304,920, miles a year saved. Now, I completed that project in 1986. That\\'s  years ago. So over the life of that one bridge, that\\'s 6,708,240, miles that haven\\'t had to be driven at What? Let\\'s say  miles an hour. So that\\'s what? That\\'s 134,164, hours. Or 559, days. So that one little bridge has saved the people of those two communities a combined 81, years of their lives not wasted in a fucking car. 81, years. Jesus. I guess you better get back over there. Yeah. Thanks for coming by. You\\'re welcome. Who the fuck is this? I would imagine it\\'s the firm\\'s people. What? They don\\'t want any loose ends. They fired me. Fuck them. Fuck them. I totally agree. Fuck them. So come back, take the money, you\\'ll be home by 5:00. Otherwise, they\\'re going to fight you on everything. They\\'re going to fight you on your package, your options, everything. Be smart. Well, you\\'re a better man than me.  That\\'s always been true? Yes, it has. House looks good. Thanks. Hey, Eric. Don\\'t beat yourself up too much about this stuff, all right? Some people like driving the long way home. Who the fuck knows, right? There he is. John. How\\'s it looking? Cohen\\'s doing a nice job. It could work. What does that mean? It means, as you very well know, that you\\'re a very important piece of this puzzle. That\\'s very generous. It\\'s not a gift. I need to know you\\'re with me on this. I\\'m with the firm, John. I won\\'t get what I need from your boys on the floor unless they believe you. Unless they believe in you completely. Are you in on this? I\\'ve told you my reservations. You can\\'t have reservations. And I need to know now. Well, John, I am completely with the firm, as I always have been. Excuse me. All right, Will, am I getting fired? I don\\'t know. Yeah. Almost definitely. Yes.  Are you? No. Seth, it\\'s nothing you did. You\\'re just in the wrong firm at the wrong time. Young guys are always the first to get culled. Listen, nothing I\\'m gonna say is going to make you feel any better. It\\'s just going to suck for a while, and then you\\'ll be fine. You all right? Yeah. I\\'m fine. For what it\\'s worth, I\\'m sorry this is happening to you. Don\\'t be. You didn\\'t do it to me. Still, at least you\\'re going to have some nice cash to walk away with. I guess. Shit, this is really going to affect people. Yeah, it\\'s going to affect people like me. No. No. Real people. Jesus, Seth. Listen, if you really want to do this with your life, you have to believe you\\'re necessary. And you are. People want to live like this, in their cars and the big fucking houses they can\\'t even pay for, then you\\'re necessary. The only reason that they all get to continue living like kings is because we\\'ve got our fingers on the scales in their favor. I take my hand off, then the whole world gets really fucking fair really fucking quickly, and nobody actually wants that. They say they do, but they don\\'t. They want what we have to give them, but they also want to play innocent and pretend they have no idea where it came from. That\\'s more hypocrisy than I\\'m willing to swallow. So fuck Fuck normal people. The funny thing is, tomorrow, if all of this goes tits up they\\'re going to crucify us for being too reckless. But if we\\'re wrong and everything gets back on track, then the same people are going to laugh till they piss their pants, 06\\'cause we\\'re gonna look like the biggest pussies God ever let through the door. You think we\\'re going to be wrong? No, they\\'re all fucked. Good morning. Peter. You want one? I don\\'t smoke. Oh, that\\'s good. I don\\'t much either. You tired? Of what? Remember, I don\\'t work as hard as you. That\\'s not true. No, it is, actually. We all getting fired tonight? Probably. Are they going to fire you? They won\\'t exactly call it that. It\\'ll be a mercy killing, really. You don\\'t have to stand out here for me. No, I don\\'t really want to go back in there just yet. I understand that. I think I know your son. Really? Not well, but he always seemed like a nice person. He is a nice person. I guess you could say worse things about a guy. Does he know what\\'s about to happen? What do you mean? Did you talk to him? No, I hadn\\'t even thought They are all coming in now. Yes, they are. Have you ever done anything like this? No, never. Not even close. Yeah. Are you sure it\\'s the only, or the right thing to do? For who? I\\'m not sure. Neither am I. Oh, God. You all right? You\\'re about to fire me. This is all I ever wanted to do. Really? They\\'re almost ready for you, Ms. Robertson. Couple of minutes. You as well? Yes.  Jesus? Yeah.  Sorry? Thank you. I didn\\'t think they were going to be able to get you back here. Well, they told me they were going to drag me through hell on everything over the next two years, my options, my health care. Or I could come back here and make 1176, an hour to sit quietly in this room. Didn\\'t seem like much of a choice. It never is. Obviously, looking back, it was expressed with insufficient urgency, but your point was passed on. I need you to know that. Eric. It\\'s okay. I understand. Believe me. There was nothing else you could have done. I guess. At the time, it didn\\'t seem like there was much of a choice. It never does. You have kids, yeah? So, what\\'s your package going to be like? I don\\'t know. That\\'s what I\\'m waiting for now. It\\'s probably going to be pretty good. It better be. Thank you all for coming in a little early this morning. I know yesterday was pretty bad, and I wish I could say that today\\'s gonna be less so, but that isn\\'t going to be the case. Now, I\\'m supposed to read this statement to you all here. But why don\\'t you just read it on your own time, and I\\'ll just tell you what the fuck is going on here. I\\'ve been here all night meeting with the executive committee, and the decision has been made to unwind a considerable portion of the firm\\'s holdings and several key asset classes. The crux of it is, in the firm\\'s thinking, the party is over as of this morning. There\\'s gonna be considerable turmoil in the markets for the foreseeable future, and they believe it is better that this turmoil begin with us. As a result, the firm has decided to liquidate its majority position of fixed income MBS today. These are your packets. You will see what accounts you\\'re responsible for today. I\\'m sure it hasn\\'t taken you long to understand the implications of this sale on your relationships with your counter parties and, as a result, on your careers. I have expressed this reality to the executive committee, and they understand. As a result, if you achieve a 93% sale of your assets, you will receive a $1. million one-off bonus. If the floor as a whole achieves a 93% sale, you will get an additional $1. million apiece. For those of you who have never been through this before, this is what the beginning of a fire sale looks like. I cannot begin to tell you how important the first hour and a half is gonna be. I want you to hit every bite you can find. Dealers, brokers, clients. Your mother, if she\\'s buying. And, no swaps. It\\'s outgoing only. Today. Obviously, this is not going down the way that any of us would have hoped. But the ground is shifting below our feet, and apparently there\\'s no other way out. Guys, this is obviously a very, very unique situation. If we are successful today, we will have been successful in destroying our own jobs. I cannot promise that any of you, all of you, some of you will be repositioned within the firm. But I can tell you that I am very proud of the work that we have done here together. I\\'ve been at this place  years, and I can tell you from experience that people are going to say some very nasty things about what we do here today and about what you\\'ve dedicated a portion of your lives to. But, have faith that in the bigger picture, our skills have not been wasted. We have accomplished much, and our talents have been used for the greater good. Here\\'s your packets. Get to work.  City this is Eric? Give me Elliot.  City? Hey, it\\'s Will Emerson. William, how are you? I\\'m all right. How\\'s the trouble and strife? Busting my ass, as always. You see, that\\'s what I tried to tell you, John. Why do you think I\\'m single? I know you did. What can I do for you? Listen. I just got the tap on my shoulder, and we\\'ve got some risk over here that we need to move. So today it looks like my loss is your gain. What kind of size are we talking? It should be on your screen. I just sent it. Jesus! Where does this land?   on the dollar.91. All three and we\\'re done at 94.  Ninety-three and a halfDone.  Trading? Hello, gorgeous. Will, what\\'s happening over there? Well, today\\'s moving day. Fuck are you guys so worked up about? You think they tell me anything? All I know is that today, my loss is your gain. Now you\\'re a friendly, so I\\'ve come to you first. I got  mil at  year paying out a point and a half above par.  Where \\'s it from? Where\\'s it from? Do you care? No, not really. Now, where\\'s the trade? I\\'m hearing things  AlexisYou guys are scaring me a little. I\\'m only sharing this with you right now. 85. Done.  Deutsche? It\\'s Will Emerson. Fuck you, you limey bastard. Come on, are you still angry about that? Word is out. I\\'m hanging up now.  Merrill? Lawrence! What the fuck are you guys doing over there?  Just a little spring cleaning? That is not what I\\'m hearing. All right, Lawrence, are you a buyer? I\\'m not sure anymore. Where at? Well, it sounds like I should be asking you where at. What are we talking about here? Three hundred seventy-five mil at  year mixed.  Fuck me? Are you with me on this?  Sixty-three cents? Oh, fuck you. I\\'m hanging up. Sixty-three. Let me call my man here. I\\'ll come back to you in five. It may be  in 5. Well, all right, then. Stay on the line. Sam, pick up the phone.  Sam, get on the line!Yeah.  I got Lawrence at Merrill? Where are we?  Sixty-three cents? Jesus.  On what? mix 30. Get him to  and hit it. Are you fucking kidding me? That\\'s What is that? That\\'s a $ million loss on a single trade. I understand. Hit it. Hey, Lawrence. We\\'re fill or kill at 65. It\\'s filled. Well done. I just want to give you a heads up. They\\'re going to start sending a few people home now. Now? Yes, Sam. No loose ends. Of course. And for what it\\'s worth, you\\'re still good. Yeah, I guess someone upstairs really likes you. Sam. Please, sit. Congratulations are clearly in order. They did the best they could. You did a hell of a job. And I thank you for it. Come on, sit. Excuse me for eating, but it\\'s been a long day.  Can I get you something? No, nothing. Thanks. So, what can I do for you? I want out. I\\'m done. I want out.  It\\'s been a very difficult day for everyone? I need you to release my options, if they\\'re worth anything after today. I want my bonus. I\\'m out. You\\'ll get your bonus, your options, and keep your current base. But I need you to stay with me for the next  months, okay? Oh, come on, Sam. Put a smile on your face. You did some good today. You said that yourself. Do you know, I\\'m starting to feel a little better about this whole thing. You\\'re one of the luckiest guys in the world, Sam. Could have been digging ditches all these years. That\\'s true. And if I had, at least there\\'d be some holes in the ground to show for it. Jesus. I just don\\'t know how we fucked this up quite so much. When did you start feeling so sorry for yourself? It\\'s unbearable. What? So you think we might have put a few people out of business today. That\\'s all for naught. But you\\'ve been doing that every day for almost  years, Sam. And if this is all for naught, then so is everything out there. It\\'s just money. It\\'s made up, pieces of paper with pictures on it so that we don\\'t have to kill each other just to get something to eat. It\\'s not wrong. And it\\'s certainly no different today than it\\'s ever been. 1637, 1797, 1819,1837, 1857,1884, 1901, 1907, 1929, 1937, 1974, 1987, Jesus. Didn\\'t that fucker fuck me up good. 1992, 1997, 2000, and whatever we want to call this. It\\'s all just the same thing, over and over. We can\\'t help ourselves. And you and I can\\'t control it or stop it or even slow it. Or even ever so slightly alter it. We just react. And we make a lot of money if we get it right. And we get left by the side of the road if we get it wrong. And there have always been and there always will be the same percentage of winners and losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat cats and starving dogs in this world. Yeah. There may be more of us today than there\\'s ever been. But the percentages, they stay exactly the same. I\\'ll do it, John, but not because of your little speech. But because I need the money. Hard to believe after all these years, but I need the money. This is the executive dining room.  Do you want coffee or tea? No. You gonna keep the kid? Keep him? He\\'s getting promoted. It\\'s all hands on deck now, Sam. There\\'s going to be a lot of money to be made coming out of this mess, and we\\'re gonna need all the brains we can get around here. Hello. I\\'ve called the police. Mary.  Sam? Yep. What are you doing? Sam, what are you doing? Ella died. I was driving home from the vet and I couldn\\'t think of where else to go.  She belongs here? I know. But, Sam, you don\\'t live here anymore. Are you all right? You don\\'t look so good. Yeah, it\\'s been a rough day all the way around. I know, Sammy called. Is he all right? They got hammered, but they got out alive. Good. Well, I\\'m gonna go back inside and go back to bed. The alarm is on, so don\\'t try and break in. Take care of yourself.'),\n",

       "   'Iceland is a stable democracy with a high standard of living, and, until recently, extremely low unemployment and government debt. We had the complete infrastructure of a modern society. Clean energy, food production. Fisheries with a quota system to manage them. Good healthcare, education, clean air. Not much crime. It\\'s a good place for families to live. We had almost end-of-history status. But in 2000, Iceland\\'s government began a broad policy of deregulation that would have disastrous consequences, first for the environment and then for the economy. They started by allowing multinational corporations like Alcoa to build giant aluminum-smelting plants and exploit Iceland\\'s geothermal and hydroelectric energy sources. Many of the most beautiful areas in the highlands with the most spectacular colors are geothermal. So nothing comes without consequence. At the same time, the government privatized Iceland\\'s three largest banks. The result was one of the purest experiments in financial deregulation ever conducted. We have had enough. How could all of this happen? Finance took over and more or less wrecked the place. In a five-year period, these three tiny banks, which had never operated outside of Iceland, borrowed  billion dollars,  times the size of Iceland\\'s economy. The bankers showered money on themselves, each other, and their friends. There was a massive bubble. Stock prices went up by a factor of nine. House prices more than doubled. He borrowed billions to buy up high-end retail businesses in London. He also bought a pinstriped private jet, a  million-dollar yacht and a Manhattan penthouse. Newspapers always had the headline: This millionaire bought this company in the U? K. Or in Finland or in France or wherever, instead of saying: \"This millionaire took a billion-dollar loan to buy this company, and he took it from your local bank.\" The banks set up money market funds, and the banks advised deposit-holders to withdraw money and put them in the money market funds. The Ponzi scheme needed everything it could. American accounting firms like KPMG audited the Icelandic banks and investment firms and found nothing wrong. And American credit-rating agencies said Iceland was wonderful. In February 2007, the rating agency upgraded the banks to the highest possible rate, triple-A. It went so far as the government here traveling with the bankers as a PR show. When Iceland\\'s banks collapsed at the end of 2008, unemployment tripled in six months. There is nobody unaffected in Iceland. A lot of people lost their savings. Yes, that\\'s the case. Government regulators who should\\'ve been protecting the citizens had done nothing. You have two lawyers from the regulator going down to a bank to talk about some issue. When they approach the bank, they would see  SUVs outside the bank. You enter the bank, and you have the  lawyers sitting in front of you, right, very well prepared, ready to kill any argument you make. And then, if you do really well, they\\'ll offer you a job. One-third of Iceland\\'s financial regulators went to work for the banks. But this is a universal problem, huh? In New York, you have the same problem, right? What do you think of Wall Street incomes these days? Excessive. I\\'ve been told it\\'s extremely difficult for the IMF to criticize the United States. I wouldn\\'t say that. We deeply regret our breaches of U? S. Law. They\\'re amazed at how much cocaine these Wall Streeters can use and get up and go to work the next day. I didn\\'t know what credit default swaps are. I\\'m a little bit old-fashioned. Has Larry Summers ever expressed remorse? I don\\'t hear confessions. The government\\'s just writing checks. That\\'s plan A, that\\'s plan B and that\\'s plan C. Would you support legal controls on executive pay? I would not. Are you comfortable with the level of compensation in financial services? If they\\'ve earned it, yes, I am. Do you think they\\'ve earned it? I think so. And so you\\'ve helped these people blow the world up? You could say that. They were having massive private gains at public loss. When you think you can create something out of nothing it\\'s difficult to resist. I\\'m concerned people want to go back to the old way, the way they were operating prior to the crisis. I was getting a lot of anonymous e-mails from bankers saying: \"You can\\'t quote me, but I\\'m really concerned.\" Why do you think there isn\\'t a more systematic investigation being undertaken? Because then you\\'ll find the culprits. You think Columbia Business. School has any conflict-of-interest problem? I don\\'t see that we do. The regulators didn\\'t do their job. They had the power to do every case that I made. They just didn\\'t want to. Lehman Brothers, one of the most venerable and biggest investment banks, was forced to declare itself bankrupt. Another, Merrill Lynch, was forced to sell itself today. World financial markets are way down, following dramatic developments. In September 2008, the bankruptcy of the U? S. Investment bank Lehman Brothers and the collapse of the world\\'s largest insurance company, AIG, triggered a global crisis. Fears gripped markets overnight. Stocks fell off a cliff. The largest single point drop in history. Share prices continued to tumble in the aftermath of the Lehman collapse. The result was a global recession, which cost the world tens of trillions of dollars, rendered  million people unemployed and doubled the national debt of the United States. With the destruction of equity and housing wealth, the destruction of income, of jobs,  million people globally could end up below the poverty line again. This is just a hugely, hugely expensive crisis. This crisis was not an accident. It was caused by an out-of-control industry. Since the s, the rise of the U? S. Financial sector has led to a series of increasingly severe financial crises. Each crisis has caused more damage, while the industry has made more and more money. After the Great Depression the United States had  years of economic growth without a single financial crisis. The financial industry was tightly regulated. Most regular banks were local businesses prohibited from speculating with depositors\\' savings. Investment banks, which handled stock and bond trading, were small, private partnerships. In the traditional investment banking model, the partners put the money up, and they watch that money very carefully. They wanted to live well, but they didn\\'t want to bet the ranch on anything. Paul Volcker served in the Treasury Department and was chairman of the Federal Reserve from  to 1987. Before going into government, he was a financial economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. When I left Chase to go in the Treasury in 1969, my income was in the neighborhood of $45, a year. Forty-five thousand dollars a year. Morgan Stanley, in 1972, had approximately  total personnel, one office, and capital of  million dollars. Now Morgan Stanley has 50, workers and has capital of several billion and has offices all over the world. In the s, the financial industry exploded. The investment banks went public, giving them huge amounts of stockholder money. People on Wall Street started getting rich. I had a friend who was a bond trader at Merrill Lynch in the s. He had a job as a train conductor at night because he had three kids and couldn\\'t support them on what a trader made. By 1986, he was making millions of dollars and thought it was because he was smart. The highest order of business before the nation is to restore our economic prosperity. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan chose as Treasury secretary the CEO of the investment bank Merrill Lynch, Donald Regan. Wall Street and the president see eye to eye. I\\'ve talked to leaders of Wall Street. They say, \"We\\'re behind the president  percent.\" The Reagan administration, supported by economists and financial lobbyists, started a  year period of financial deregulation. In 1982, the Reagan administration deregulated savings-and-loan companies, allowing them to make risky investments with depositors\\' money. By the end of the decade, hundreds of savings-and-loan companies had failed. This crisis cost taxpayers $  billion and cost many people their life savings. It may be the biggest bank heist in our history. Thousands of executives went to jail for looting their companies. One of the most extreme cases was Charles Keating. Mr. Keating, got a word? In 1985, when federal regulators began investigating him, Keating hired an economist named Alan Greenspan. In this letter to regulators, Greenspan praised Keating\\'s sound business plans and expertise and said he saw no risk in allowing Keating to invest customers\\' money. Keating reportedly paid Greenspan $40,000. Keating went to prison shortly afterwards. As for Alan Greenspan, Reagan appointed him chairman of America\\'s central bank, the Federal Reserve. Greenspan was reappointed by presidents Clinton and George W. Bush. During the Clinton administration, deregulation continued under Greenspan and Treasury secretaries Robert Rubin, the former CEO of the investment bank Goldman Sachs, and Larry Summers, a Harvard economics Professor. The financial sector, Wall Street being powerful, having lobbies, lots of money, step by step, captured the political system. Both on the Democratic and the Republican side. By the late s, the financial sector had consolidated into a few gigantic firms, each of them so large that their failure could threaten the whole system. And the Clinton administration helped them grow even larger. In 1998, Citicorp and Travelers merged to form Citigroup, the largest financial services company in the world. The merger violated the Glass-Steagall Act, a law passed after the Great Depression, preventing banks with consumer deposits from engaging in risky investment-banking activities. It was illegal to acquire Travelers. Greenspan said nothing. The Federal Reserve gave them an exemption for a year, then they got the law passed. In 1999, at the urging of Summers and Rubin, Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, known to some as the Citigroup Relief Act. It overturned Glass-Steagall and cleared the way for future mergers. Why do you have big banks? Because banks like monopoly power, lobbying power. Because banks know that when they\\'re too big, they will be bailed. Markets are inherently unstable. Or at least potentially unstable. An appropriate metaphor is the oil tankers. They are very big, and therefore, you have to put in compartments to prevent the sloshing around of oil from capsizing the boat. The design of the boat has to take that into account. And after the Depression, the regulations actually introduced these very watertight compartments. And deregulation has led to the end of compartmentalization. The next crisis came at the end of the \\'s. The investment banks fueled a massive bubble in Internet stocks, which was followed by a crash in  that caused $ trillion in investment losses. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency created during the Depression to regulate investment banking, had done nothing. In the absence of meaningful federal action, and given the clear failure of self-regulation, it\\'s become necessary for others to step in and adopt the protections needed. Eliot Spitzer\\'s investigation revealed the investment banks promoted Internet companies they knew would fail. Analysts were being paid based on how much business they brought in. What they said publicly was quite different from what they said privately. Infospace, given the highest possible rating, dismissed by an analyst as a \"piece of junk.\" Excite, also highly rated, called \"such a piece of crap.\" The defense that was proffered by many of the investment banks was not \"you\\'re wrong,\" it was, \"Everybody\\'s doing it, everybody knows it\\'s going on.\" Nobody should rely on these analysts anyway.\" In December, 2002,  investment banks settled the case for a total of $ 1. billion and promised to change their ways. Scott Talbott is the chief lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, one of Washington\\'s most powerful groups, which represents nearly all of the world\\'s largest financial companies. Are you comfortable with the fact that several of your member companies have engaged in large-scale criminal activity? L You\\'ll have to be specific. Okay. And first of all, criminal activity shouldn\\'t be accepted, period. Since deregulation began, the world\\'s biggest financial firms have been caught laundering money, defrauding customers and cooking their books again and again and again. Credit Suisse helped funnel money for Iran\\'s nuclear program and for Iran\\'s Aerospace Industries Organization, which builds ballistic missiles. Any information that would identify it as Iranian would be removed. The bank was fined $ million. Citibank helped funnel $  million of drug money out of Mexico. Did you comment that she should, quote: \"Lose any documents connected with the account\"? I said that in a kidding manner. It was at the early stages of this. I did not mean it seriously. Between  and 2003, Fannie Mae overstated it\\'s earnings by more than $  billion. These accounting standards are complex and require determinations over which experts often disagree. CEO Franklin Raines, who used to be President Clinton\\'s budget director, received over $ million in bonuses. When UBS was caught helping wealthy Americans evade taxes, they refused to cooperate with the government. Would you be willing to supply the names? If there\\'s a treaty framework. No treaty framework. You\\'ve agreed you participated in a fraud. Hm. But while the companies face unprecedented fines, the investment firms do not have to admit any wrongdoing. When dealing with this many products, this many customers, mistakes happen. The financial services industry seems to have a level of criminality that is somewhat distinctive. You know, when was the last time that Cisco or Intel or Google or Apple or IBM, you know? I agree about high-tech versus financial services So how come? High-tech is a creative business where the value generation and income derives from actually creating something new. Beginning in the s, deregulation and advances in technology led to an explosion of complex financial products called derivatives. Economists and bankers claimed they made markets safer. But instead, they made them unstable. Since the end of the Cold War, a lot of former physicists, mathematicians, decided to apply their skills, not on, you know, Cold War technology, but on financial markets. And together with investment bankers Creating different weapons. Absolutely. You know, as Warren Buffett said, weapons of mass destruction. Regulators, politicians, business people did not take seriously the threat of innovation on the stability of the financial system. Using derivatives, bankers could gamble on virtually anything. They could bet on the rise or fall of oil prices, the bankruptcy of a company, even the weather. By the late s, derivatives were a  trillion-dollar unregulated market. In 1998, someone tried to regulate them. Brooksley Born graduated first in her class at Stanford Law School and was the first woman to edit a major law review. After running the derivatives practice at Arnold & Porter, Born was appointed by Clinton to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversaw the derivatives market. Brooksley Born asked me if I would come work with her. We decided that this was a serious, potentially destabilizing market. In May of 1998, the CFTC issued a proposal to regulate derivatives. Clinton\\'s Treasury Department had an immediate response. I happened to go into Brooksley\\'s office, and she was just putting down the receiver on her telephone, and the blood had drained from her face. And she looked at me and said, \"That was Larry Summers.\" He had  bankers in his office. He conveyed it in a very bullying fashion, sort of directing her to stop. Banks were now reliant for earnings on these activities. And that led to a Titanic battle to prevent this from being regulated. Shortly after the phone call from Summers, Greenspan, Rubin, and SEC chairman Arthur Levitt issued a joint statement condemning Born and recommending legislation to keep derivatives unregulated. Regulation of derivatives transactions that are privately negotiated by professionals is unnecessary. She was overruled, unfortunately. First by the Clinton administration and then by the Congress. In 2000, Senator Phil Gramm took a major role in getting a bill passed that pretty much exempted derivatives from regulation. They are unifying markets, reducing regulatory burden. I believe we need to do it. It is our very great hope that it will be possible to move this year on legislation that, in a suitable way goes to create legal certainty for OTC derivatives. I wish to associate myself with all the remarks of Secretary Summers. In December of 000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. Written with the help of financial-industry lobbyists, it banned the regulation of derivatives. After that, it was off to the races. Use of derivatives and financial innovation exploded dramatically after 2000. So help me God. So help me God. By the time George W. Bush took office in 2001, the U? S. Financial sector was vastly more profitable, concentrated and powerful than ever before. Dominating this industry were five investment banks, two financial conglomerates, three securities insurance companies and three rating agencies. And linking them all together was the securitization food chain. A new system which connected trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans with investors all over the world. Thirty years ago, if you went to get a loan for a home, the person lending you the money expected you to pay him or her back. You got a loan from a lender who wanted to be paid back. We\\'ve since developed securitization, whereby people who make the loan are no longer at risk if they fail to repay. In the old system, when a homeowner paid their mortgage every month, the money went to their local lender. And since mortgages took decades to repay, lenders were careful. In the new system, lenders sold mortgages to investment banks. The banks combined thousands of mortgages and loans, including car loans, student loans, and credit card debt, to create complex derivatives called collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs. The investment banks then sold the CDOs to investors. Now when homeowners paid their mortgages, the money went to investors all over the world. The investment banks paid rating agencies to evaluate the CDOs, and many of them were given a triple-A rating, which is the highest possible investment grade. This made CDOs popular with retirement funds, which could only purchase highly rated securities. This system was a ticking time bomb. Lenders didn\\'t care anymore about whether a borrower could repay, so they started making riskier loans. The investment banks didn\\'t care either. The more CDOs they sold, the higher their profits. And the rating agencies, which were paid by the investment banks, had no liability if their ratings of CDOs proved wrong. You weren\\'t gonna be on the hook, there weren\\'t regulatory constraints. So it was a green light to just pump out more and more loans. Between  and 2003, the number of mortgage loans made each year nearly quadrupled. Everybody in this securitization food chain, from the very beginning until the end, didn\\'t care about the quality of the mortgage. They were caring about maximizing their volume and getting a fee out of it. In the early s, there was a huge increase in the riskiest loans, called subprime. When thousands of subprime loans were combined to create CDOs, many of them still received triple-A ratings. Now, it would have been possible to create derivative products that don\\'t have these risks, that carry the equivalent of deductibles, where there are limits on the risks that can be taken on, and so forth. They didn\\'t do that, did they? They didn\\'t. In retrospect, they should\\'ve done. So did these guys know they were doing something dangerous? I think they did. All the incentives financial institutions offered to their mortgage brokers were based on selling the most profitable products, which were predatory loans. If they make more money, that\\'s where they\\'ll put you. Suddenly, hundreds of billions of dollars a year were flowing through the securitization chain. Since anyone could get a mortgage, home purchases and housing prices skyrocketed. The result was the biggest financial bubble in history. Real estate is real. They can see their asset. They can live in their asset. They can rent out their asset. You had a huge boom in housing that made no sense at all. The financing appetites of the financial sector drove what everybody else did. Last time we had a housing bubble was in the late \\'s. In that case, the increase in home price had been relatively minor. That housing bubble led to a relatively severe recession. From  until 2006, real home prices effectively doubled. At $ a ticket, they\\'ve come to hear how to buy their very own piece of the American dream. Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch were all in on this. The subprime lending alone increased from  billion a year in funding to over  billion a year in  years. They knew what was happening. Countrywide Financial, the largest subprime lender, issued $ billion worth of loans. It made over $  billion in profits as a result. On Wall Street, annual cash bonuses spiked. Traders and CEOs became enormously wealthy during the bubble. Lehman Brothers was a top underwriter of subprime lending, and their CEO, Richard Fuld, took home $ million. On Wall Street, this housing and credit bubble was leading to hundreds of billions of dollars of profits. You know, by  about  percent of all profits of S&P  firms was coming from financial institutions. It wasn\\'t real profits or income. It was money created by the system and booked as income. Two, three years down the road there\\'s a default, it\\'s all wiped out. I think it was, in fact, in retrospect, a great big national And not just national, global Ponzi scheme. Through the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Federal Reserve board had broad authority to regulate the mortgage industry. But Fed chairman Alan Greenspan refused to use it. Alan Greenspan said, \"No, that\\'s regulation. I don\\'t believe in it.\" For  years, Robert Gnaizda was the head of Greenlining, a powerful consumer advocacy group. He met with Greenspan on a regular basis. We gave him an example of Countrywide and  different complex adjustable-rate mortgages. He said, \"If you had a doctorate in math\" you wouldn\\'t be able to understand them enough \"to know which was good for you and which wasn\\'t.\" So we thought he was gonna take action. But as the conversation continued, it was clear he was stuck with his ideology. We met again with Greenspan in \\'05. Often we met with him twice a year, and never less than once a year. And he wouldn\\'t change his mind. In this world of global communications, the efficient movement of capital is helping to create the greatest prosperity in human history. A hundred and forty-six people were cut from the SEC Enforcement Division? Is that what you also testified to? Yes. Yeah, I think there has been a systematic gutting, or whatever you wanna call it, of the agency and it\\'s capability through cutting back of staff. The SEC Office of Risk Management was reduced to a staff, did you say, of one? Yeah. When that gentleman would go home, he could turn the lights out. During the bubble, investment banks were borrowing heavily to buy more loans and create more CDOs. The ratio between borrowed money and the banks\\' own money was called leverage. The more the banks borrowed, the higher their leverage. In 2004, Henry Paulson, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, helped lobby the SEC to relax limits on leverage, allowing the banks to sharply increase their borrowing. The SEC somehow decided to let investment banks gamble a lot more. That was nuts. I don\\'t know why they did that, but they did. We\\'ve said these are the big guys, and clearly that\\'s true. But that means if anything goes wrong, it\\'s going to be an awfully big mess. You are dealing with the most highly sophisticated financial institutions. These are the firms that do most of the derivative activity. We talked to some as to what their comfort level was. The firms actually thought that the number was appropriate. The commissioners vote to adopt the new rules as recommended.  Yes? Yes. We do indeed. It\\'s unanimous. And we are adjourned. The degree of leverage in the financial system became absolutely frightening. Investment banks leveraging up to the level of  to-1. Which means that a tiny percent decrease in the value of their asset base would leave them insolvent. There was another ticking time bomb in the financial system. AIG, the world\\'s largest insurance company, was selling huge quantities of derivatives called credit default swaps. For investors who owned CDOs, credit default swaps worked like an insurance policy. An investor who purchased a credit default swap paid AIG a quarterly premium. If the CDO went bad, AIG promised to pay the investor for their losses. But unlike regular insurance, speculators could also buy credit default swaps from AIG in order to bet against CDOs they didn\\'t own. In insurance, you can only insure something you own. Let\\'s say you and I own property. I own a house. I can only insure that house once. The derivatives universe essentially enables anybody to actually insure that house. You could insure that, somebody else could. So  people might insure my house. So what happens is, if my house burns down, the number of losses in the system becomes proportionately larger. Since credit default swaps were unregulated, AIG didn\\'t have to put aside any money to cover potential losses. Instead, AIG paid it\\'s employees huge cash bonuses as soon as contracts were signed. But if the CDOs later went bad, AIG would be on the hook. People were essentially being rewarded for taking massive risks. In good times, they generate short-term revenues and profits and, therefore, bonuses. But that\\'s gonna lead to the firm to be bankrupt over time. That\\'s a distorted system of compensation. AIG\\'s Financial Products division in London issued $ billion worth of credit default swaps during the bubble, many of them for CDOs backed by subprime mortgages. The  employees at AIGFP made $3. billion between  and 2007. Joseph Cassano, the head of AIGFP, personally made $ million. It\\'s hard for us, and without being flippant, to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing one dollar in any of those transactions. In 2007, AIG\\'s auditors raised warnings. One of them, Joseph St. Denis, resigned in protest after Cassano repeatedly blocked him from investigating AIGFP\\'s accounting. Let me tell you one person that didn\\'t get a bonus while everybody else was getting bonuses. That was St. Denis. Mr. St. Denis tried to alert the two of you to the fact you were running into big problems. He quit in frustration, and he didn\\'t get a bonus. In 2005, Raghuram Rajan, then the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, delivered a paper at the Jackson Hole symposium, the most elite banking conference in the world. Who was in the audience? It was the central bankers of the world, ranging from Mr. Greenspan himself, Ben Bernanke Larry Summers. Tim Geithner was there. The title of the paper was essentially: \"Is Financial Development Making the World Riskier?\" And the conclusion was, it is. Rajan\\'s paper focused on incentive structures that generated huge cash bonuses based on short-term profits, but which imposed no penalties for later losses. Rajan argued that these incentives encouraged bankers to take risks that might eventually destroy their own firms or even the entire financial system. It\\'s very easy to generate performance by taking on more risk. So what you need to do is compensate for risk-adjusted performance. And that\\'s where all the bodies are buried. Rajan, you know, hit the nail on the head. What he particularly said was: \"You guys have claimed you\\'ve found a way\" to make more profits with less risk. I say you\\'ve found a way to make more profits with more risk. \"There\\'s a big difference.\" Summers was vocal. He basically thought that I was criticizing the change in the financial world and was worried about, you know, regulation, which would reverse this change. Essentially he accused me of being a Luddite. He wanted to make sure that we didn\\'t bring in a whole new set of regulations to constrain the financial sector. You\\'re gonna make an extra $ million a year, or $  million a year, for putting your financial institution at risk. Someone else pays the bill, you don\\'t. Would you make that bet? Most people on Wall Street said, \"Sure, I\\'d make that bet.\" It never was enough. They don\\'t wanna own one home, they wanna own five homes. And they wanna have an expensive penthouse on Park Avenue. And they wanna have their own private jet. You think this is an industry where high? Very high compensation levels are justified? I think I would take caution, or take heed, or take exception to your word \"very high.\" It\\'s relative. You have a  million-dollar home in Florida. You have a summer home in Sun Valley, Idaho. An art collection filled with million-dollar paintings. Richard Fuld never appeared on the trading floor. There were art advisors there all the time. He had a private elevator. He wanted to be disconnected. His elevator, they hired technicians to program it so that his driver would call in in the morning and a security guard would hold it. There\\'s only a three-second window where he actually has to see people. And he hops into this elevator and it goes straight to 31. Lehman owned corporate jets. You know about this? Yes. How many were there? Well, there were six, including the  s. They also had a helicopter. Isn\\'t that kind of a lot of planes to have? We\\'re dealing with type-A personalities. And type-A personalities know everything in the world. Banking became a pissing contest. \"Mine\\'s bigger than yours.\" That kind of stuff. It was all men that ran it, incidentally. Fifty-billion-dollar deals weren\\'t large enough, so we\\'d do  billion deals. These people are risk-takers. They\\'re impulsive. It\\'s part of their behavior. It\\'s part of their personality. And that manifests outside of work as well. It was quite typical for the guys to go out to go to strip bars, to use drugs. I see a lot of cocaine use, use of prostitution. Recently, neuroscientists have done experiments where they\\'ve taken individuals and put them into an MRI machine, and they have them play a game where the prize is money. And they noticed that when the subjects earn money, the part of the brain that gets stimulated is the same part that cocaine stimulates. A lot of people feel that they need to participate in that behavior to make it, to get promoted, get recognized. According to a Bloomberg article, business entertainment represents  percent of revenue for derivatives brokers and often includes strip clubs, prostitution and drugs. A New York broker filed a lawsuit in  against his firm alleging he was required to retain prostitutes to entertain traders. There\\'s just a blatant disregard for the impact that their actions might have on society, on family. They have no problem using a prostitute and going home to their wife. How many customers? About 10, at that point in time. What fraction were from Wall Street? Of the higher-end clients, probably  to  percent. Were all the major Wall Street firms represented? Goldman Sachs? Lehman Brothers. They\\'re all in there. Morgan Stanley was a little less of that. I think Goldman was pretty, pretty big with that. Clients would call and say: \"Can you get me a Lamborghini for the girl?\" These guys were spending corporate money. I had many black cards from, you know, the various financial firms. What\\'s happening is services are being charged to computer repair. Trading research, you know, consulting for market compliance. Just gave them letterhead and said, \"Make your own invoice.\" This behavior extends to the senior management of the firm? Absolutely does. Yeah. I know for a fact that it does. It extends to the very top. A friend of mine in a company that has a big financial presence said: \"It\\'s about time you learned about subprime mortgages.\" So he set up a session with his trading desk and me. And the techie who did all this gets very excited, runs to his computer, pulls up in about three seconds this Goldman Sachs issue of securities. It was a complete disaster. Borrowers had borrowed, on average, 9. percent of the price of the house. They have no money in the house. If anything goes wrong, they walk away from the mortgage. This is not a loan you\\'d really make, right? You\\'ve gotta be crazy. But somehow, you took  of these loans, and by the time the guys were done at Goldman Sachs and the rating agencies, two-thirds of the loans were rated triple-A. They were rated as safe as government securities. It\\'s utterly mad. Goldman Sachs sold at least $3. billion worth of these toxic CDOs in the first half of 2006. The CEO of Goldman Sachs at this time was Henry Paulson, the highest paid CEO on Wall Street. Good morning. I\\'m pleased to announce that I will nominate Henry Paulson to be the Secretary of the Treasury. He has a lifetime of experience. He has knowledge of financial markets. He\\'s earned a reputation for candor and integrity. You might think it would be hard to adjust to a meager government salary. But taking the job as Treasury secretary was the best financial decision of his life. Paulson had to sell his $ million of Goldman stock when he went to work for the government. But because of a law passed by the first President Bush, he didn\\'t have to pay any taxes on it. It saved him $ million. The article came out in October of 2007. Already, a third of the mortgages defaulted. Now most of them are going. One group that had purchased these now worthless securities was the Public Employees\\' Retirement System of Mississippi, which provides monthly benefits to over 80, retirees. They lost millions of dollars and are now suing Goldman Sachs. By late 2006, Goldman had taken things a step further. It didn\\'t just sell toxic CDOs, it started betting against them at the same time it was telling customers that they were high-quality investments. By purchasing credit default swaps from AIG, Goldman could bet against CDOs it didn\\'t own and get paid when the CDOs failed. I asked if anybody called the customers and said: \"We don\\'t really like this kind of mortgage anymore, and we thought you ought to know.\" They didn\\'t say anything, but you could feel the laughter over the phone. Goldman Sachs bought at least $ billion of credit default swaps from AIG. It was so much that Goldman realized that AIG itself might go bankrupt. So they spent $  million insuring themselves against AIG\\'s potential collapse. Then in 2007, Goldman went even further. They started selling CDOs specifically designed so that the more money their customers lost, the more money Goldman Sachs made. Six hundred million dollars of Timberwolf securities is what you sold. Before you sold them, this is what your sales team were telling to each other: \"Boy, that Timberwolf was one shitty deal.\" This was an e-mail to me in late June, after the transaction. No, no. You sold Timberwolf after as well. We did trades after that. Yeah. Okay. The next e-mail Take a look. July 1, \\'07. Tells the sales force, \"The top priority is Timberwolf.\" Your top priority to sell is that shitty deal. If you have an adverse interest to your client, do you have the duty to disclose it? To tell that client of your adverse interest? That\\'s my question. I\\'m trying to understand I think you understand. You don\\'t wanna answer. Do you believe you have a duty to act in your clients\\' best interest? I repeat, we have a duty to serve our clients by showing prices on transactions that they ask us to show prices for. What do you think about selling securities which your own people think are crap? Does that bother you? I think they would.  As a hypothetical? No, this is real.  Well, then I don\\'t knowWe heard it today. We heard it today. \"This is a shitty deal.\" \"This is crap.\" I heard nothing today that makes me think anything went wrong. Is there not a conflict when you sell something to somebody and then are determined to bet against that same security, and you don\\'t disclose that to the person you\\'re selling it to? You see a problem? In the context of market making, that is not a conflict. When you heard your employees in e-mails said, \"What a shitty deal,\" \"What a piece of crap,\" did you feel anything? That\\'s very unfortunate to have on e-mail. Are you embar? And very unfortunate I don\\'t I don\\'t \"On e-mail\"? How about feeling that way? It\\'s very unfortunate for anyone to have said that in any form. Are your competitors engaged in similar activities? Yes, and to a greater extent than us in most cases. Hedge fund manager John Paulson made $  billion betting against the mortgage market. When Paulson ran out of mortgage securities to bet against, he worked with Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank to create more. Morgan Stanley was also selling mortgage securities it was betting against, and it\\'s now being sued by the Government Employees\\' Retirement Fund of the Virgin Islands for fraud. The lawsuit alleges that Morgan Stanley knew that the CDOs were junk. Although they were rated triple-A, Morgan Stanley was betting they would fail. A year later, Morgan Stanley had made hundreds of millions of dollars, while the investors had lost almost all of their money. You would have thought pension funds would have said: \"Those are subprime. Why am I buying them?\" They had these guys at Moody\\'s and Standard & Poor\\'s who said, \"That\\'s a triple-A.\" No securities got issued without the seal of approval of the rating agencies. The three rating agencies, Moody\\'s, S&P and Fitch, made billions of dollars giving high ratings to risky securities. Moody\\'s, the largest rating agency, quadrupled it\\'s profits between  and 2007. Moody\\'s and S&P get compensated based on putting out ratings reports. And the more structured securities they gave a triple-A rating to, the higher their earnings were. Imagine going to The Times saying: \"Write a positive story, I\\'ll pay you $500,000. If you don\\'t, I\\'ll give you nothing.\" Rating agencies could have stopped the party and said: \"Sorry. We\\'re gonna tighten our standards,\" and immediately cut off the funding to risky borrowers. Triple-A-rated instruments mushroomed from just a handful to thousands and thousands. Hundreds of billions of dollars were being rated, you know, and Per year? Per year. Oh, yeah. I\\'ve now testified before both houses of Congress on the credit rating agency issue, and both times they trot out very prominent First Amendment lawyers and argue that, \"When we say something is rated triple-A\", that is merely our \\'opinion.\\' You shouldn\\'t rely on it.\" S&P\\'s ratings express our opinion. Our ratings are our opinions. They\\'re opinions. Opinions. And they are just opinions. I think we are emphasizing the fact that our ratings are opinions. They do not speak to the market value of a security, the volatility of it\\'s price, or it\\'s suitability as an investment. We have many economists saying: \"Oh. This is a bubble, it\\'s going to burst. This is going to be an issue for the economy.\" Some say it could even \\'cause a recession at some point. What is the worst-case scenario if, in fact, we were to see prices come down substantially across the country? I don\\'t buy your premise. It\\'s an unlikely possibility. We\\'ve never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis. Ben Bernanke became chairman of the Federal Reserve in February 2006, the top year for subprime lending. But despite numerous warnings, Bernanke and the Federal Reserve Board did nothing. Robert Gnaizda met with Bernanke and the Federal Reserve Board three times after Bernanke became chairman. Only at the last meeting did he suggest that there was a problem and that the government ought to look into it. When? When was that? What year? It\\'s 2009, March  th, in D? C. This year? This year we met, yes. And so for the two previous years you met him. Even in 2008? Yes. One of the six Federal Reserve Board governors serving under Bernanke was Frederic Mishkin, who was appointed by President Bush in 2006. Did you participate in the meetings Robert Gnaizda and Greenlining had with the Federal Reserve Board? Yes, I did. I was on the committee that was involved with the Consumer Community Affairs Committee. He warned, in an extremely explicit manner, about what was going on. He came to the Federal Reserve Board with loan documentation of the kind of loans that were frequently being made. And he was listened to politely, and nothing was done. So again, I don\\'t know the details in terms of, um In fact, I just don\\'t l Whatever information he provided, I\\'m not sure exactly. To be honest with you, I can\\'t remember this kind of discussion, but certainly there were issues that were coming up. The question is, how pervasive are they? Why didn\\'t you try looking? I think that people did. We had people looking at Excuse me. You can\\'t be serious. You would have found things. That\\'s very easy to always say that you can always find it. As early as 2004, the FBI was already warning about an epidemic of mortgage fraud. They reported inflated appraisals, doctored loan documentation and other fraudulent activity. In 2005, the IMF\\'s chief economist, Raghuram Rajan, warned that dangerous incentives could lead to a crisis. Then came Nouriel Roubini\\'s warnings in 2006, Allan Sloan\\'s articles in Fortune magazine and The Washington Post in 2007, and repeated warnings from the IMF. I said, and on behalf of the institution, the crisis in front of us is a huge crisis. Who did you talk to? The government, Treasury, Fed, everybody. In May of 2007, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman circulated a presentation, \"Who is Holding the Bag?\" Which described how the bubble would unravel. And in early 2008, Charles Morris published his book about the impending crisis. You\\'re not sure. What do you do? You might have some suspicions that underwriting standards are weakened. But then the question is, should you do anything about it? By 2008, home foreclosures were skyrocketing and the securitization food chain imploded. Lenders could no longer sell their loans to the investment banks. And as the loans went bad, dozens of lenders failed. Chuck Prince of Citibank famously said that we have to dance until the music stops. Actually, the music had stopped already when he said that. The market for CDOs collapsed, leaving investment banks holding hundreds of billions of dollars in loans, CDOs, and real estate they couldn\\'t sell. When the crisis started, both the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve were totally behind the curve. They did not understand the extent of it. At what point do you remember thinking for the first time: \"This is dangerous, this is bad\"? I remember very well one I think it was a G  meeting of February, 2008. And I remember discussing the issue with Hank Paulson. And I clearly remember telling Hank: \"We are watching this Tsunami coming,\" and you\\'re just proposing that we ask \"which swimming costume we\\'re going to put on.\" What was his response? What was his feeling? \"Things are under control.\" Yes, we are looking at this situation carefully, \"and, yeah, it\\'s under control.\" We\\'re gonna keep growing. Okay? And, obviously, I\\'ll say it: If you\\'re growing, you\\'re not in recession, right? I mean, we all know that. One of the pillars of Wall Street In March 2008, the investment bank Bear Stearns ran out of cash and was acquired for $ a share by JPMorgan Chase. The deal was backed by $ billion in emergency guarantees from the Federal Reserve. That was when the administration could have come in and put in place various measures to reduce system risk. The information I\\'m receiving is the end is not here, that there are other shoes to fall. Well, I\\'ve seen those investment banks, working with the Fed and the SEC, strengthen their liquidity, strengthen their capital positions. I get reports all the time. Our regulators are very vigilant. On September  th, 2008, Henry Paulson announced the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, giant lenders on the brink of collapse. Nothing about our actions today reflects a changed view of the housing correction or the strength of other U? S. Financial institutions. Two days later, Lehman Brothers announced record losses of $3. billion, and it\\'s stock collapsed. The effects of Lehman and AIG in September still came as a surprise. I mean, this is even after July and Fannie and Freddie. So clearly there was stuff that, as of September, major stuff, that nobody knew about. I think that\\'s I think that\\'s fair. Bear Stearns was rated triple-A like a month before it went bankrupt? More likely A2. A2? Yeah. Okay. A is still not bankrupt. No, that\\'s a high investment grade. Solid investment grade rating. Lehman Brothers, A within days of failing. AIG, double-A within days of being bailed out. Fannie Mae and Freddie Macwere triple-A when they were rescued. Citigroup, Merrill, all of them had investment-grade ratings. How can that be? Well, that\\'s a good question. That\\'s a great question. At no point did the administration ever go to all the major institutions and say: \"This is serious. Tell us what your positions are. You know, no bullshit. Where are you?\" Well, first, that\\'s what the regulators That\\'s their job, right? Their job is to understand the exposure across these institutions. And they have a very refined understanding that I think became more respon More refined as the crisis proceeded. So Forgive me, but that\\'s clearly not true. What do you mean, that\\'s not true? In August of 2008, were you aware of the credit ratings held by Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, AIG, and did you think that they were accurate? Well, certainly by that time, it was clear earlier credit ratings weren\\'t accurate.  They had been downgraded? No, they hadn\\'t. There was downgrading in terms of the industry and concerns of the All those firms were rated at least A until a couple of days before they were rescued. The answer is I don\\'t know enough to answer your question on this issue. Governor Fred Mishkin is resigning, effective August 31. He plans to return to Columbia\\'s Graduate School of Business. Why did you leave the Federal Reserve in August of  in the middle of the worst financial crisis? So that I had to revise a textbook. His departure leaves the board with three of it\\'s seven seats vacant just when the economy needs it most. I\\'m sure your textbook is important and widely read, but in August 2008, some more important things were going on in the world, don\\'t you think? By Friday, September th, Lehman Brothers had run out of cash and the entire investment-banking industry was sinking fast. The stability of the global financial system was in jeopardy. That weekend, Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner president of the New York Federal Reserve, called an emergency meeting with the CEOs of the major banks in an effort to rescue Lehman. But Lehman wasn\\'t alone. Merrill Lynch was also on the brink of failure. And that Sunday, it was acquired by Bank of America. The only bank interested in buying Lehman was the British firm Barclays. But British regulators demanded a financial guarantee from the U? S. Paulson refused. We got in a cab and went to the Federal Reserve Bank. They wanted the bankruptcy case commenced before midnight of September 14. We kept pressing that this would be a terrible event, and at some point I used the word Armageddon, and they consider the consequences of what they were proposing. The effect on the market would be extraordinary. You said this? Yes. They just said they had considered all of the comments we had made, and they were still of the belief that in order to calm the markets and move forward, it was necessary for Lehman to go into bankruptcy. \"Calm the markets\"? Yes. When were you first told that Lehman, in fact, was going to go bankrupt? After the fact. After the fact? Wow. Okay. Um And what was your reaction when you learned of it? \"Holy cow.\" Paulson and Bernanke had not consulted with other governments and didn\\'t know the consequences of foreign bankruptcy laws. Lehman Brothers London continue to empty their desks. Under British law, Lehman\\'s London office had to be closed immediately. All transactions came to a halt, and there are thousands of transactions. The hedge funds who had had assets with Lehman in London discovered overnight, to their complete horror, they couldn\\'t get those assets back. One of the points of the hub failed. And that had huge knock-on effects around the system. The oldest money market fund in the nation wrote off three-quarters of a billion dollars in bad debt issued by now-bankrupt Lehman Brothers. Lehman\\'s failure caused a collapse in the commercial paper market, which many companies depend on to pay for expenses such as payroll. That means they have to lay off employees, they can\\'t buy parts. It stops business in it\\'s tracks. People stood and said, \"Listen, what can we believe in? There\\'s nothing we can trust anymore.\" That same week, AIG owed $  billion to holders of credit default swaps, and it didn\\'t have the money. AIG was another hub. If AIG had stopped, you know, all planes may have to stop flying. On September  th, AIG is taken over by the government. One day later, Paulson and Bernanke ask Congress for $ billion to bail out the banks. We\\'re coming together. They warned that the alternative would be a catastrophic collapse. It was scary. You know, the entire system froze up. Every part of the financial system, every part of the credit system. Nobody could borrow money. It was like a cardiac arrest of the global financial system. I\\'m playing the hand dealt me. A lot of what I\\'m dealing with I\\'m dealing with the consequences of things that were done years ago. Secretary Paulson spoke through the fall. All the potential root causes of this, and there are plenty, he called them. I\\'m not sure You\\'re not being serious about that. I am being serious. What would you have expected? What were you looking for that you didn\\'t see? He was the senior advocate for prohibiting the regulation of credit default swaps and also lifting the leverage limits on the investment banks. So again, what? He mentioned those things? I never heard him mention those things. Could we turn this off for a second? When AIG was bailed out, the owners of it\\'s credit default swaps, the most prominent of which was Goldman Sachs, were paid $ billion the next day. Paulson, Bernanke and Tim Geithner forced AIG to pay  cents on the dollar rather than negotiate lower prices. Eventually, the AIG bailout cost taxpayers over $  billion. A hundred and sixty billion dollars went through AIG. Fourteen billion went to Goldman Sachs. At the same time, Paulson and Geithner forced AIG to surrender it\\'s right to sue Goldman and the other banks for fraud. Isn\\'t there a problem when the person in charge of dealing with this crisis is the former CEO of Goldman Sachs? Someone who had a major role in causing it. It\\'s fair to say that the financial markets today are incredibly complicated. And supply urgently needed money. On October th, 2008, President Bush signs a  billion-dollar bailout bill. But world stock markets continue to fall amid fears that a global recession is now underway. The bailout legislation does nothing to stem the tide of layoffs and foreclosures. Unemployment in the United States and Europe rises to  percent. The recession accelerates and spreads globally. I began to get really scared because I hadn\\'t foreseen the whole world going down at the same rate at the same time. By December of 2008, General Motors and Chrysler are facing bankruptcy. And as U? S. Consumers cut back on spending, Chinese manufacturers see sales plummet. Over  million migrant workers in China lose their jobs. At the end of the day, the poorest, as always, pay the most. Here, you can earn a lot of money. Like 70,  U? S. Dollars per month. As a farmer in the countryside, you cannot earn as much money. The workers, they just wire their salary to their hometown to give to their families. The crisis started in America. We all know it will be coming to China. Some of the factories try to cut off some workers. And some people will get poor because they\\'ll lose their jobs. Life gets harder. We were growing at about  percent. It was a super year. Then we suddenly went to minus-nine this quarter. Exports collapsed, and we\\'re talking like  percent. So we just took a hit, you know. Fell off a cliff. Boomp. Even as the crisis unfolded, we didn\\'t know how wide it was going to spread or how severe it was going to be. We were still hoping that there would be some way for us to have a shelter and be less battered by the storm. But it\\'s not possible. It\\'s a very globalized world. The economies are all linked together. Every time a home goes into foreclosure, it affects everyone who lives around that house. When that house goes on the market, it\\'ll be sold at a lower price. Maybe before it goes on the market, it won\\'t be well-maintained. We estimate another  million homeowners will lose their homes. We went out on a weekend to see what houses were for sale. We saw one we liked. The payment was going to be $3200. Everything was beautiful, the house was very pretty. The payment low. Everything was We won the lottery. But the reality was when the first payment arrived. I felt very bad for my husband because he works too much. And we have three children. The majority I\\'ve seen are people hurt by the economy. They were living day to day, paycheck to paycheck, and that ran out. Unemployment won\\'t pay a mortgage. It won\\'t pay a car bill. I was a log truck driver. They shut down the logging systems, shut down the sawmills. So I moved down here on a construction job. And the construction jobs got shut down too, so Things are so tough. There\\'s a lot of people out there. Soon you\\'re gonna be seeing more camps like this because there\\'s just no jobs right now. When the company did well, we did well. When the company did not do well, sir, we did not do well. The men who destroyed their own companies and plunged the world into crisis walked away from the wreckage with their fortunes intact. The top five executives at Lehman Brothers made over a billion dollars between  and 2007. And when the firm went bankrupt, they got to keep all the money. The system worked. It doesn\\'t make sense to make a failing loan because we lose. The borrower loses, the community loses and we lose. Countrywide\\'s CEO, Angelo Mozilo, made $ million between  and 2008. One hundred forty million came from dumping his Countrywide stock in the  months before the company collapsed. I hold the board accountable when a business fails. They\\'re responsible for hiring and firing the CEO and overseeing big strategic decisions. The problem with boards in America is the way boards are elected. You know, the boards are pretty much, in many cases, picked by the CEO. The board of directors and compensation committees are the two bodies best situated to determine pay for executives. How do you think they\\'ve done over the past  years? Well, I think that if you look at those I would give about a B, because A B? A B, yes. Not an F? Not an F, not an F. Stan O\\'neal, the CEO of Merrill Lynch, received $ million in  and  alone. After driving his firm into the ground, the board of directors allowed him to resign, and he collected $  million in severance. Instead of being fired, Stan O\\'neal is allowed to resign and takes away $  million. That\\'s a decision that that board of directors made. What grade do you give that decision? That\\'s a tougher one. I don\\'t know if I\\'d give it a B as well. O\\'neal\\'s successor, John Thain, was paid $ million in 2007. And in December of 2008, two months after Merrill was bailed out by U? S. Taxpayers, Thain and Merrill\\'s board handed out billions in bonuses. In March of 2008, AIG\\'s Financial Products division lost $  billion. Instead of being fired, Joseph Cassano, head of AIGFP, was kept on as a consultant for a million dollars a month. You wanna make sure key players and key employees within AIGFP, we retain that intellectual knowledge. I attended a very interesting dinner organized by Hank Paulson a little more than one year ago with some officials and a couple of CEOs from the biggest banks in the U? S. And surprisingly enough, all these gentlemen were arguing: \"We were too greedy, so we have part of the responsibility.\" Fine. Then they were turning to the treasurer, Secretary of the Treasury, and saying: \"You should regulate more. We\\'re too greedy, we can\\'t avoid it. The only way to avoid this is to have more regulation.\" I have spoken to many bankers about this question, including very senior ones. And this is the first time that I\\'ve ever heard anybody say they wanted their compensation to be regulated in any way. Yeah, because it was at the moment where they were afraid. And after, when solution to the crisis began to appear, then probably they changed their mind. In the U? S., the banks are now bigger, more powerful and more concentrated than ever before. There are fewer competitors. A lot of smaller banks have been taken over by big ones. J? P. Morgan is even bigger than it was before. J? P. Morgan took over first Bear Stearns and then WaMu. Bank of America took over Countrywide and Merrill Lynch. Wells Fargo took over Wachovia. After the crisis, the financial industry, including the Financial Services Roundtable, worked harder than ever to fight reform. The financial sector employs  lobbyists, more than five for each member of Congress. You think the financial services industry has excessive political influence in the United States? No. I think that every person in the country is represented here in Washington. And you think that all segments of American society have equal and fair access to the system? That you can walk into any hearing room that you would like. Yes, I do. One can walk into any hearing room. One cannot necessarily write the lobbying checks that your industry writes or engage in the level of political contributions your industry engages in. Between  and 2008, the financial industry spent over $ billion on lobbying and campaign contributions. And since the crisis, they\\'re spending even more money. The financial industry also exerts it\\'s influence in a more subtle way, one that most Americans don\\'t know about. It has corrupted the study of economics itself. Deregulation had tremendous financial and intellectual support because people argued it for their own benefit. The economics profession was the main source of that illusion. Since the s, academic economists have been major advocates of deregulation and played powerful roles in shaping U? S. Government policy. Very few of these economic experts warned about the crisis. And even after the crisis, many of them opposed reform. The guys who taught these things tended to get paid a lot of money being consultants. Business school professors don\\'t live on a faculty salary. They do very, very well. Over the last decade, the financial services industries made about $ billion worth of political contributions in the U? S. That\\'s kind of a lot of money. That doesn\\'t bother you? No. Martin Feldstein is a Professor at Harvard and one of the world\\'s most prominent economists. As President Reagan\\'s chief economic advisor, he was a major architect of deregulation. And from  until 2009, he was on the board of directors of both AIG and AIG Financial Products, which paid him millions of dollars. You have any regrets about having been on AIG\\'s board? I have no comments. No, I have no regrets about being on AIG\\'s board. None? That I can say. Absolutely none. Okay. You have any regrets about AIG\\'s decisions? I cannot say anything more about AIG. I\\'ve taught at Northwestern in Chicago, Harvard and Columbia. Glenn Hubbard is the Dean of Columbia Business School and was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush. Do you think the financial services industry has too much political power in the United States? I don\\'t think so. No. You certainly wouldn\\'t get that impression by the drubbing that they regularly get in Washington. Many prominent academics quietly make fortunes helping the financial industry shape public debate and government policy. The Analysis Group, Charles River Associates, Compass Lexecon and the Law and Economics Consulting Group manage a multibillion-dollar industry that provides academic experts for hire. Two bankers who used these services were Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, Bear Stearns hedge fund managers prosecuted for securities fraud. After hiring the Analysis Group, both were acquitted. Glenn Hubbard was paid $ 100, to testify in their defense. Do you think the economics discipline has a conflict-of-interest problem? I\\'m not sure I know what you mean. Do you think a significant fraction of the economics discipline, economists, have financial conflicts of interest that might call into question or color? I see what you\\'re saying. I doubt it. Most academic economists aren\\'t wealthy business people. Hubbard makes $250, a year as a board member of MetLife and was formerly on the board of Capmark, a major commercial mortgage lender during the bubble, which went bankrupt in 2009. He has also advised Nomura Securities, KKR Financial Corporation and many other financial firms. Laura Tyson, who declined to be interviewed for this film, is a Professor at the University of California, Berkeley. She was the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, then director of the National Economic Council under Clinton. After leaving government, she joined the board of Morgan Stanley, which pays her $350, a year. Ruth Simmons, president of Brown University, makes over $300, a year on the board of Goldman Sachs. Larry Summers, who, as Treasury secretary, played a role in the deregulation of derivatives, became president of Harvard in 2001. While at Harvard, he made millions consulting to hedge funds and millions more in speaking fees, much of it from investment banks. According to his federal disclosure report, Summers\\' net worth is between $ 16. million and $39. million. Frederic Mishkin, who returned to Columbia Business School after leaving the Federal Reserve, reported on his disclosure report that his net worth was between $ million and $  million. In 2006, you coauthored a study of Iceland\\'s financial system. \"Iceland is an advanced country\" with excellent institutions, low corruption, rule of law. The economy has adjusted to financial liberalization \"while prudential regulation and supervision is generally quite strong.\" And that was the mistake, that it turns out prudential regulation and supervision was not strong in Iceland during this period What led you to think it was? You\\'re going with the information you had and generally, the view was that Iceland had very good institutions. It was an advanced country Who told you that? What research did you do? You talk to people. You have faith in the central bank, which actually did fall down on the job. That clearly it This Why have faith in a central bank? Well, that faith You try Because you go with the information you have. How much were you paid to write it? I was paid I think the number It\\'s public information. On your CV, the title of this report has been changed from \"Financial Stability in Iceland\" to \"Financial Instability in Iceland.\" Well, I don\\'t know. Whatever it is If there\\'s a typo, there\\'s a typo. What should be publicly available is whenever anybody does research on a topic that they disclose if they have any financial conflict with that research. But if I recall, there is no policy to that effect. I can\\'t imagine anybody not doing that in terms of putting it in a paper. You There would be significant professional sanction for failure to do that. I didn\\'t see any place in the study where you indicated you\\'d been paid by the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce to produce it. No, I don\\'t You know. Okay. Richard Portes, the most famous economist in Britain and a Professor at London Business School, was also commissioned by the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce to write a report which praised the Icelandic financial sector. The banks themselves are highly liquid. They\\'ve made money on the fall of the Icelandic krona. These are strong banks. Their market funding is assured for the coming year.  These are well-run banks? Thank you. Like Mishkin, Portes\\' report didn\\'t disclose his payment from the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce. Does Harvard require disclosures of financial conflict of interest? Not to my knowledge. Do you require people to report the compensation received from outside activities? No. Don\\'t you think that\\'s a problem? I don\\'t see why. Martin Feldstein being on the board of AIG, Laura Tyson at Morgan Stanley, Larry Summers making $  million consulting to financial services firms. Irrelevant? Hm. Yeah. Yeah. Basically irrelevant. You\\'ve written many articles about a wide array of subjects. You never saw fit to investigate the risks of unregulated credit default swaps? I never did. Same question with regard to executive compensation? The regulation of corporate governance? The effect of political contributions? I don\\'t know that I would have anything to add to those discussions. I\\'m looking at your resume now. It looks to me as if the majority of your outside activities are consulting and directorship arrangements with the financial services industry. Would you not agree with that characterization? To my knowledge, I don\\'t think my consulting clients are on my CV. So I wouldn\\'t know. Who are your consulting clients? I don\\'t believe I have to discuss that with you. Okay. In fact, you have a few more minutes and the interview\\'s over. Do you consult for any financial services firms? The answer is I do. And? And But I do not wanna go into details about that. Do they include other financial services firms? Possibly. You don\\'t remember? This isn\\'t a deposition, sir. I was polite enough to give you time. Foolishly, I now see. But you have three more minutes. Give it your best shot. In 2004, at the height of the bubble, Glenn Hubbard coauthored a widely read paper with William C. Dudley, the chief economist of Goldman Sachs. In the paper, Hubbard praised credit derivatives and the securitization chain, stating they had improved allocation of capital and were enhancing financial stability. He cited reduced volatility in the economy and stated that recessions had become less frequent and milder. Credit derivatives were protecting banks against losses and helping to distribute risk. A medical researcher writes an article, saying: \"To treat this disease, you should prescribe this drug.\" Turns out doctor makes  percent of personal income from manufacture of this drug. Does not bother you? I think it\\'s certainly important to disclose the, um The, um Well, I think that\\'s also a little different from cases that we\\'re talking about here because, um So, what do you think this says about the economics discipline? Well, I mean, it has no relevance to anything, really. And, indeed, I think it\\'s a part of the It\\'s an important part of the problem. The rising power of the U? S. Financial sector was part of a wider change in America. Since the s, the United States has become a more unequal society, and it\\'s economic dominance has declined. Companies like General Motors, Chrysler and U? S. Steel, formerly the core of the U? S. Economy, were poorly managed and falling behind their foreign competitors. And as countries like China opened their economies, American companies sent jobs overseas to save money. For many, many years, the  million people in the developed world were sheltered from all of this additional labor that existed on the planet. Suddenly the Bamboo Curtain and the Iron Curtain are lifted and you have 2. billion additional people. American factory workers were laid off by the tens of thousands. Our manufacturing base was destroyed, literally, over a few years. As manufacturing declined, other industries rose. The United States leads the world in information technology, where high-paying jobs are easy to find. But those jobs require an education. And for average Americans, college is increasingly out of reach. While universities like Harvard have billions of dollars in endowments, funding for public universities is shrinking and tuition is rising. Tuition for California\\'s public universities rose from $ in the s to over $ 10, in 2010. The most important determinant of whether Americans go to college is whether they can find the money to pay for it. Meanwhile, American tax policy shifted to favor the wealthy. When I first came to office, I thought taxes were too high, and they were. The most dramatic change was a series of tax cuts designed by Glenn Hubbard, who was serving as President Bush\\'s chief economic advisor. The Bush administration sharply reduced taxes on investment gains, stock dividends, and eliminated the estate tax. We had a comprehensive plan that when acted has left nearly $ 1. trillion in the hands of American workers, families, investors and small-business owners. Most benefits of these cuts went to the wealthiest  percent of Americans. And by the way, it was the cornerstone in many ways, of our economic recovery policy. Inequality of wealth in the United States is now higher than in any other developed country. American families responded to these changes in two ways: By working longer hours and by going into debt. As the middle class falls further and further behind, there is a political urge to respond by making it easier to get credit. You don\\'t have to have a lousy home. The low-income home buyer can have just as nice a house as anybody else. American families borrowed to finance their homes, their cars, their healthcare, and their children\\'s educations. People in the bottom  percent lost ground between  and 2007. It all went to the top  percent. For the first time in history, average Americans have less education and are less prosperous than their parents. The era of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street and in Washington has led us to a financial crisis as serious as any that we\\'ve faced since the Great Depression. When the financial crisis struck before the  election, Barack Obama pointed to Wall Street greed and regulatory failures as examples of the need for change in America. A lack of oversight in Washington and on Wall Street is exactly what got us into this mess. After taking office, Obama spoke of the need to reform the industry. We want a risk regulator, increased capital requirements. We need a consumer financial protection agency. We need to change Wall Street\\'s culture. But when finally enacted in mid-2010, the administration\\'s financial reforms were weak. And in some critical areas, including the rating agencies, lobbying and compensation, nothing significant was even proposed. Addressing Obama and, quote, \"regulatory reform,\" my response, if it was one word, would be \"ha.\" There\\'s very little reform. How come? It\\'s a Wall Street government. Obama chose Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary. Geithner was president of the New York Federal Reserve during the crisis, and a key player in the decision to pay Goldman Sachs  cents on the dollar for it\\'s bets against mortgages. When Tim Geithner was testifying to be confirmed as Treasury secretary he said, \"I have never been a regulator.\" That said to me he did not understand his job as President of the New York Fed. The new President of the New York Fed is William C. Dudley, the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs whose paper with Glenn Hubbard praised derivatives. Geithner\\'s chief of staff is Mark Patterson, a former lobbyist for Goldman. And one of the senior advisors is Lewis Sachs, who oversaw Tricadia, a company heavily involved in betting against the mortgage securities it was selling. To head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Obama picked Gary Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs executive who had helped ban the regulation of derivatives. To run the Securities and Exchange Commission, Obama picked Mary Schapiro, the former CEO of FINRA, the investment banking industry\\'s self-regulation body. Obama\\'s chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, made $320, serving on the board of Freddie Mac. Both Martin Feldstein and Laura Tyson are members of Obama\\'s Economic Recovery Advisory Board. And Obama\\'s chief economic advisor is Larry Summers. The most senior economic advisors are the ones who were there, who built the structure. When it was clear that Summers and Geithner were going to play major roles as advisors, I knew this was going to be status quo. The Obama administration resisted regulation of bank compensation even as foreign leaders took action. The financial industry is a service industry. It should serve others before it serves itself. In September of 2009, Christine Lagarde and the finance ministers of Sweden, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain and Germany called for the G nations, including the United States, to impose strict regulations on bank compensation. And in July of 2010, the European Parliament enacted those very regulations. The Obama administration had no response. Their view is it\\'s a temporary blip and things will go back to normal. That is why I am reappointing him as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Thank you, Ben. In 2009, Barack Obama reappointed Ben Bernanke. Thank you, Mr. President. As of mid-2010, not a single senior financial executive had been criminally prosecuted, or even arrested. No special prosecutor had been appointed. Not a single firm had been prosecuted criminally for securities fraud or accounting fraud. The Obama administration has made no attempt to recover any compensation given to financial executives during the bubble. I certainly would think of criminal action against some of Countrywide\\'s top leaders, like Mozilo. I\\'d certainly look at Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. For criminal prosecutions? Yes. In regard to Yes. They\\'d be very hard to win, but I think they could do it if they got enough underlings to tell the truth. In an industry in which drug use, prostitution and billing of prostitutes as a business expense occur on an industrial scale, it wouldn\\'t be hard to make people talk if you really wanted to. They gave me a plea bargain and I took it. They were not interested in my records. They weren\\'t interested in anything. Not interested in your records? That\\'s correct. Correct. There\\'s a sensibility that you don\\'t use people\\'s personal vices in the context of Wall Street cases, necessarily, to get them to flip. Maybe after the cataclysms that we\\'ve been through, people will reevaluate. I\\'m not the one to pass judgment on that right now. You come to us today telling us, \"We\\'re sorry, we didn\\'t mean it.\" We won\\'t do it again. Trust us.\" Well, I have some people in my constituency that actually robbed some of your banks. And they say the same thing. They\\'re sorry. They didn\\'t mean it. They won\\'t do it again. In 2009, as unemployment hit it\\'s highest level in  years, Morgan Stanley paid it\\'s employees over $  billion, and Goldman Sachs paid out over $  billion. In 2010, bonuses were even higher. Why should a financial engineer be paid four times to  times more than a real engineer? A real engineer build Bridges. A financial engineer build dreams. And, you know, when those dreams turn out to be nightmares, other people pay for it. For decades, the American financial system was stable and safe. But then something changed. The financial industry turned it\\'s back on society, corrupted our political system and plunged the world economy into crisis. At enormous cost, we\\'ve avoided disaster and are recovering. But the men and institutions that caused the crisis are still in power, and that needs to change. They will tell us that we need them, and that what they do is too complicated for us to understand. They will tell us it won\\'t happen again. They will spend billions fighting reform. It won\\'t be easy. But some things are worth fighting for.'),\n",

You wanna tell us why? Well, I gave it a year, Dad, and it\\'s just not for me. I see. So that means you\\'ve been lying to us for six months. Six months, Seth. \"School\\'s fine, Dad. My grades are good, Dad.\" Let\\'s just leave that for a second. So you dropped out. That means you haven\\'t been getting your student loan checks, right? Is that right? How are you making the rent every month, Seth? I\\'m running a business, and I\\'m just earning a living. Earning a living? This what you call earning a living?  Marty, are those drugs? Yes.  Yes, those are drugs? No, Mom. This is an honest living. And you can ask any one of my customers. What do you mean, \"customers\"? Where\\'s the customers? They\\'re children of people in this community. How do you think I got these? Anyway, it\\'s illegal. You\\'re running a backdoor card game! How do you think this reflects on me? I\\'m a judge, for Christ\\'s sake! Are you listening to me? I\\'m gonna be honest with you. You\\'re runnin\\'a good business. I think you\\'re a smart kid, pullin\\' in some real cash. But I gotta tell you, man, this is risky fuckin\\' business. I mean, you really honestly plan on dealing cards to college kids when you\\'re fuckin\\' 35? You don\\'t think you\\'ll get pinched in the next couple years? Maybe it\\'s time to start thinkin\\' about down-the-line time. So, you want me to come work for you? What? I guess it\\'ll be like retribution for me taking all your money here? First of all, I am not done with you here, all right? And, no, you\\'re only gonna work for me a short time. You pass the Series Seven. You learn the ropes. You\\'re on your own. Yeah, ask Adam, man. He\\'ll tell you.  It\\'s good? It\\'s good?  Yeah? I\\'m gonna be blunt. We\\'re talkin\\' about millions of dollars. I was making good money with the casino but these guys were macking it hard. That\\'s the level I wanted to be operating on. So I drove out to Long Island, way out. The office was a good hour away from Wall Street. Somebody forgot to tell the guys who worked there, though. They looked and acted like they took the Six train to Fulton Street every morning. But it wasn\\'t Wall Street. It was exit  on the Long Island Expressway a good hour from the New York Stock Exchange. No, no, no, no. You don\\'t wanna act now. This stock is going to turn. I\\'m invested very heavily myself. We just stay put. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever had the opportunity to purchase I? P.O. Before but we have this company that\\'s going to market in about a week or so. We\\'re gonna have to move on this now. This is gonna happen next week. We don\\'t wanna marry this stock. We\\'re in; we\\'re out. What do you mean, you don\\'t buy stock over the phone? How do you do it? Smoke signals? Telepathy? World leaders solve problems over the phone. I\\'m not a Charles Schwab. I don\\'t need your business; I value it. I\\'m successful to the point where I don\\'t need to chase your business. Hey, kid, get the fuck outta here! Over here.  Have they started interviewing yet? No.  Know how long it\\'s gonna be? You\\'ll all be going in together. But I thought this was, like, an interview? It is. It\\'s a group interview. You\\'ll see. No, man. You\\'re a male. Group interview, my ass. It was like a Hitler Youth rally, in retrospect. The guy who pitched us, Jim Young, was the head recruiter there.  Okay, guys. Let\\'s go? Between him and Michael, honestly they could sell bubble gum in the lockjaw ward at Bellevue. I\\'m sorry, man. This is my seat.  Oh, shit. I\\'m so sorry? It\\'s okay. Don\\'t worry about it.  Fuckin\\' dumb-ass? Get the fuck outta here.  What? Don\\'t talk to me. Don\\'t look at me. Just get your ass out of that Italian leather chair and get the fuck out. Right now. Come on. Let\\'s go, schlepp rock. Out. Sit down. We expect everyone here to treat their coworkers with a certain level of respect. Before we start, I have one question. Has anyone passed a Series Seven exam?  I have a Series Seven license? Good for you. You can get out too. What? Why? We don\\'t hire brokers here. We train new ones. That\\'s it, Skippy. Pack your shit. Let\\'s go. Okay. Here\\'s the deal. I\\'m not here to waste your time. I hope you\\'re not here to waste mine. So I\\'m gonna keep this short. If you become an employee of this firm you will make your first million within three years. Okay? I repeat that: You will make a million dollars within three years of your first day of employment at J? T. Marlin. There is no question whether or not you\\'ll become a millionaire here. The only question is how many times over. You think I\\'m joking? I am not joking. I am a millionaire. It\\'s a weird thing to hear, right? I\\'ll tell ya. It\\'s a weird thing to say. I am a fucking millionaire. And guess how old I am. Twenty-seven. You know what that makes me here? A fuckin\\' senior citizen. This firm is entirely comprised of people your age, not mine. Lucky for me, I\\'m very fucking good at my job, or I\\'d be out of one. You guys are the new blood. You\\'re gonna go home with the kessef. You are the future big swinging dicks of this firm. Now, you all look money hungry, and that\\'s good. Anybody tells you money is the root of all evil doesn\\'t fuckin\\' have any. They say money can\\'t buy happiness? Look at the fuckin\\' smile on my face. Ear to ear, baby. You want details? Fine. I drive a Ferrari  Cabriolet. What\\'s up? I have a ridiculous house in the South Fork. I have every toy you could imagine, and best of all, kids I am liquid. So, now you know what\\'s possible. Let me tell you what\\'s required. You are required to work your fucking ass off at this firm. We want winners here, not pikers. A piker walks at the bell. A piker asks how much vacation you get in the first year. Vacation? People come and work at this firm for one reason: To become filthy rich. We\\'re not here to make friends. We\\'re not savin\\' the manatees, guys. You want vacation time? Go teach third grade, public school. Okay. The first three months at the firm are as a trainee. You make $ a week. After you\\'re done training, you take the Series Seven. Pass that, you become junior broker and you open accounts for your team leader. You open  accounts, you start workin\\' for yourself. Sky\\'s the limit. Word about being a trainee. Friends, parents, other brokers, they\\'re gonna give you shit. It\\'s true. $ a week? Not a lot of money. Pay them no mind. You need to learn this business, and this is the time to do it. Once you pass the test, none of that\\'s gonna matter. Your friends are shit. Tell them you made  grand last month, they\\'re won\\'t fucking believe you. Fuck them! Fuck \\'em! Parents don\\'t like the life you lead? \"Fuck you, Mom and Dad.\" See how it feels when you\\'re makin\\' their fuckin\\' Lexus payments. Now, go home and think about it. Think about whether it\\'s really for you. If you decide it isn\\'t It\\'s nothing to be embarrassed about. It\\'s not for everyone. Thanks. But if you really want this you call me on Monday and we\\'ll talk. Just don\\'t waste my fuckin\\' time. Okay. That\\'s it.  Hi? Hi. So, what\\'s up?  How you doin\\'?I\\'m fine, Seth. What\\'s on your mind? I feel bad about the way things went at the house last week. I just don\\'t feel like we get anywhere when we talk at home. Well, I don\\'t know that there\\'s anything to talk about.  Can I get you anything to drink? No. I\\'m fine, thanks. You dropped out of school, Seth. You\\'re running an illegal casino out of your apartment. You\\'re putting my career at risk. What is there to talk about, Seth? Well, I don\\'t know why we can\\'t just discuss this. I mean Maybe you\\'re just not seeing my side. Your side? What side? You\\'re doing wrong. I\\'m not your best friend. That\\'s your mother\\'s racket. I\\'m your father. I tell you when you screw up. What did you think I was gonna do? Pat you on the back for the casino idea? Tell you what a great entrepreneur you are? So what do you want me to do, Seth? I mean, my God, if I\\'d called my father to meet me for a cup of coffee to talk about my screwups, he probably would\\'ve laughed. We didn\\'t have nice little chats about why I was a bad boy. I got smacked. And I didn\\'t do it again. Much simpler. Look. I\\'m just trying to restore what\\'s left of our relationship. \"Relationship\"? What the fuck are you talking about, relationship? What? Are we dating? I\\'m not your girlfriend Seth; I\\'m your father. Clean up your life, make an honest living and then you and I can talk like normal people, all right?  Hey, Seth? Hi. How you doin\\'?  Abby? Oh, yeah. I know. I forgot. It\\'s okay. I never told you. Besides, the other day you looked a little frazzled so I didn\\'t think you\\'d remember anyway.  Today\\'s my first day? No shit? Yeah.  See ya? See ya. No, that\\'s not how it works. If I was asking you to own 5, or 10, shares of some pink-sheet, bullshit company with negative earnings I\\'d tell you to hang up the phone call your local broker and short the stock. I wouldn\\'t expect your business. But, Don, I am bringing you Seth. Seth. Come over here. It\\'s not your table. .F? D.A. Landmark approval. It\\'s, like, the cancer pill. No. It\\'s a cancer pill. No, Don, it\\'s not Propecia P. It is the cancer pill. Oh, Donald, please take a chance. You look pretty. Thank you. So you wanna tell me where the fuck you were last night?  Not particularly? Okay. This is for you. I don\\'t know how to better explain this to you, but it\\'s over. Okay. I disagree.  Hang on a second? Here you go.  What\\'s up? Is he in? I don\\'t know. Hey. These are the D&B cards. These are our leads.  Morning? Every card is an opportunity, right? These are good leads. People on these cards buy stock. Your job is to call them and get them interested in the firm. You\\'re not actually selling stock yet, but you\\'re selling the dream. So get \\'em wet. Tell \\'em that in a month from now a senior broker\\'s gonna call them back with an idea. So who are these people? Average client\\'s  years old, from the Midwest 150, annual income, million net, has a local broker but loves a hotshot New Yorker who sounds good on the phone. So the card won\\'t tell you that. It only has name, address and occupation. So you gotta feel \\'em out, see? \"Peter Davis, Vice President, Parks Telecommunications.\" The guy\\'s probably a fuckin\\' whale. So feel \\'im out, see what he\\'s got. Truth is, it doesn\\'t matter these days. With the Dow where it is now, everybody wants a piece of the market. I can close anyone anytime anywhere. Just give me a phone number.  Greg, I have John Duncklee on three? Not now. I\\'ll call him back. Now, once you qualify the guy, you send him a press packet. It\\'ll be easy, and it\\'ll get you comfortable on the phone, which is key. This entire business revolves around the phone. Play the numbers. This is a contact sport. The more people you contact, the better you\\'ll do.  A good broker makes  calls a day? What\\'s the phone bill like? This month was approaching 400,000. Listen to me. Even though you\\'re not selling stock yet I want you to remember the code we have here, okay?  Did you see Glengarry Glen Ross? Yeah.  Do you remember \"ABC\"?Yeah. \"Always be closing.\" That\\'s right. \"Always be closing.\" \"Telling\\'s not selling.\" That\\'s the attitude you wanna have. There\\'s two rules as a trainee. Number one: We don\\'t pitch the bitch here. What? We don\\'t sell stock to women. I don\\'t care who it is; we don\\'t do it. Nancy Sinatra calls, you tell her you\\'re sorry. They\\'re a constant pain in the ass and you\\'re never gonna hear the end of it. They\\'ll call you every fucking day wanting to know why the stock dropped. And God forbid the stock should go up. You\\'re gonna hear from them every  minutes. It\\'s just not worth it. Don\\'t pitch the bitch. Number two: Don\\'t write wood, all right? A lot of trainees are so anxious to get off the phone that they just steamroll the guy into getting the press packet so they can hang up. Then I call back, and I\\'m, like \"Hi. You spoke to a junior associate of mine last month.\" And he\\'s like, \"Not interested. Bye.\" That\\'s a shitty lead, okay? That\\'s fucking wood. The info we send is bullshit, all right? The most important part is telling them you have that one great idea and that a senior broker\\'s gonna call them back in a month. This way they don\\'t think we just fire off a million recos a day. We don\\'t want clients thinkin\\' you\\'re pitching something you read in the Journal, right?  Yeah. Right? Okay, so no wood.  I\\'m serious. No wood? All right. Take it easy. Hey, don\\'t even start that fuckin\\' shit with me, okay? I\\'m tryin\\' to tell you what\\'s expected of you and what your job is. I\\'m tryin\\' to make the job easier, okay? Don\\'t give me any fuckin\\' lip. Okay. Okay, so, fine. What happens if the guy wants to buy stock right then? Now you\\'re talkin\\'. You wanna go into every call expecting just that. If somebody wants a recommendation, put the guy on hold stand up and yell \"reco\" at the top of your lungs. First senior broker who gets on the horn gets the sale.  Sound good? Yeah. Okay. That suit\\'s dog shit. Get a new suit. No, Ma. I told you. No, I\\'m not a broker yet. I\\'m a trainee. I still have to pass my Series Seven test. Please. You\\'re a stockbroker. You wear a suit to work every day, don\\'t you?  Yeah? So, what are we arguing about?  Thanks, Ma? You\\'re doing great, Seth. You\\'re working your way up from the bottom. Never easy. What did Dad say about it? He\\'s very happy. Shocked, but very happy.  He\\'s waiting for you to call him? Why doesn\\'t he call me?  One miracle at a time, okay, sweetie? All right.  Mom? I\\'m in bed.  How you doin\\'?Hi, baby. How was work? I know you\\'re not at home with a bag of cash, waiting for me to call you. But I\\'m not some  year old selling the cure for Al DS. I am  years old. I have  years of market experience. I know this business. So pick up your skirt, grab your balls and let\\'s make some money. Here you go, Greg. I hope this is better than the last batch of shit you gave me.  Produced more wood than Ron Jeremy? What? I don\\'t want you to yell \"reco\" anymore. Know what you should yell? \"Timber!\" Yeah. Mr. Fuckin\\' Wood. I hear you fuckin\\' makin\\' your calls. It\\'s bullshit, all right? If you want them off the phone so bad, why don\\'t you just hang up? You should get them excited. You know, excited? They should beg for a broker on the first call. Shit. Yeah. Howard Young, please. Seth Davis over at J? T. Marlin.  No, he\\'s not expecting my call? No. Tsk.  Okay. Yeah. I\\'ll call you? Good-bye. Good-bye. Hang up the phone. Thank you. That\\'s nice for you to do that for me. First of all, there\\'s gonna be a lot of these regardless of how good you are but you happen to suck big, fat-ass rhinoceros dick. Well, thank you. That\\'s confidence-inspiring. I got this friend who runs this other firm, right? He hands out this book to new trainees. It\\'s called a rebuttal book. It looks like a little Filofax. It\\'s got these index tabs, but instead of having letters like \"A\" to \"B,\" \"G\" to \"H,\" it has different things like \"My wife won\\'t let me\" or \"I\\'m not in the market now\" or \"Send me a prospectus.\" It has a rebuttal for any excuse. Anyway, that\\'s stuff you\\'ll have to learn later. The most important thing you gotta know right now is that you can be whoever you wanna be on the phone. You know what I\\'m sayin\\'? Who cares? Do what you gotta do. Change your last name. Say you\\'re the fuckin\\' vice president. You know? Who cares? Just get the cocksucker on the line. Yeah, but how can I do shit like that? Isn\\'t there a compliance officer here? No. No, man. Everybody does that shit. Are you kidding? I mean, even on Wall Street. You talking about John there? That guy works for us. The guy\\'s a fuckin\\' chimp. Look at him. The only compliance work he\\'s doin\\' is makin\\' sure my lunch is still hot when it gets here. He\\'s only here because the S? E.C. Requires it. Easiest job in the world. Look. I think he\\'s actually masturbating right now.  Stay the fuck away from her? Yeah. Holy shit, you slut. You made the call. No, no. Don\\'t you dare. Get your filthy one-race paws off my money. What\\'d you bet me? A month\\'s commission?  Yeah, and yours too, kid? How do you get away with this? 7\\'Cause I\\'m a Jew, and I have the mind of a champion. See this? Here, kid. Go get a tan and some Rogaine.  Watch out for this? Fuckin\\' A. The only bookie in New York that delivers FedEx. When are you gonna take the test, Seth? Well, you know, after the training program\\'s over. They want you to get a good idea of how things work there before you take the Series Seven, but it\\'s a great system.  I\\'m really learning a lot? Are you gonna be rich, Seth?  Oh, God willing? I hope so. How come I\\'ve never heard of this firm? I don\\'t know. It\\'s a smaller firm, I guess. There\\'s a million others like it you probably never heard of. The reason I ask is \\'cause I would\\'ve thought that you would\\'ve joined a firm like Goldman Sachs or something of that stature.  Marty, what are you starting for? What? No, no. Ma, it\\'s okay. The reason is, Dad that the larger houses don\\'t really like to hire kids straight out of college you know, unless you went to an Ivy League school or you wanna do cash-flow analysis for the next  years. They usually like you to work outside their firm for a few years to get a good sense of the marketplace. But most all brokers usually start out in little firms like J? T. Marlin. That\\'s great. See? He answered the question. That was easy. So all you have to do is close the casino, right? Marty, we talked about this.  What are you giving me looks for? Didn\\'t we talk about this?  What? I justIt was a celebration. You know what? I gotta go meet somebody. I love you, Ma. See ya. See ya later. Nice job, Marty. Originally, I got in for the cash. But getting my dad\\'s respect That\\'s what kept me there. So he took some parting shots from time to time. Whatever. I didn\\'t care. Not really. Anyway, the point is, I had to adapt to this new world. I didn\\'t really know these guys. What I did know is that they had all the money in the world and not a clue what to do with it. Seth, what\\'s up, man?  Wait outside? Hey, man. Thought you weren\\'t gonna make it, man. Sit down. Grab a slice. Have a beer. What\\'s up? You think he fucked Hannah or Sheen fucked her?  Both of \\'em? Did he just move in?  He\\'s been here eight months? Life all comes down to a few moments. \"This is one of \\'em.\" Sheen was kind of a pimp. Shut up, man. Listen. Gecko\\'s coming on. \"What the hell\\'s goin\\' on?\" I\\'m lookin\\' at 200, shares moved. I wanna know if we\\'re part of it. We\\'d better be, or I\\'m gonna come down and eat your lunch. Back in two, Alex. Look. I loved it at forty. Fifty? It\\'s an insult. Their analysts? They don\\'t know a preferred stock from livestock. They wait till it goes down, and like gumdrops and sperm counts This is the kid. Calls me  days in a row. Wants to be a player. Oughta be a picture of you in the dictionary under \"persistent,\" kid. Yeah? Now, listen, Jerry, I\\'m looking for negative control. No more than 30,  percent. Just enough to block anybody else\\'s merger plans and find out from the inside if the books are cooked. Looks this good on paper, we\\'re in the kill zone, pal. Lock and load. Lunch? You gotta be kidding. Lunch is for wimps. Okay, Fidel, I\\'ll talk at you. Very good. How do you do, Mr. Gekko? Bud Fox. So you say, \"Nice to meet you.\" Hope you\\'re intelligent. Where\\'d you get these?  I got a connection at the airport? Nice job, Mr. Clean. Hey. Get the fuck off me.  I\\'m really busy, Seth? No. Look, I understand, Doctor. I\\'m really busy here myself. We\\'re gonna come back to you in one month with one idea only. If you like what we have to say, great. We\\'ll do business. If not I mean, worst-case scenario, you\\'ll hear yourself a new business idea  That X ray is useless? We\\'ll part as friends, right? What? Are you working with a million dollars in the market now? Who is this? You\\'re a doctor. Have you heard of a drug called Phenodryl? It\\'s being manufactured by M? S.C. Pharmaceuticals. No. Well, listen, okay? It\\'s in the third stage of F? D.A. Approval. Word is it\\'s gonna be approved within the next three months and it could be tomorrow for all I know. But, you know, I\\'m getting ahead of myself and you\\'re real busy over there so why don\\'t I just send you out the information Wait, wait, wait. Forget the info. Let\\'s talk about this now. What was the name of that drug again? Could you hold on for one second? I\\'m gonna get a senior broker who\\'s a little more familiar with that particular stock. All right? Hold on a second. One second. Reco!  Got it? Sorry. His name\\'s Dr. Jacobs, and I\\'d say that he\\'s definitely  Whoa. I don\\'t wanna hear it, kid? Okay. Hi, Dr. Jacobs? This is Chris Marlin at J? T. Marlin.  Marlin? Right. He\\'s my father. My associate tells me you\\'re interested in one of our stocks. Your wife\\'s on three. I will call her back. Yes. M? S.C. Sounds like it might be interesting. Might be? \"Might be\" doesn\\'t sell stock at the rate M? S.C.\\'s going for it, Dr. Jacobs.  We\\'re talking very high volume? I still have to run it by my people. That\\'s great, Doc, if you wanna miss yet another opportunity here and watch your colleagues get rich doing clinical trials.  Don\\'t buy a share and hang up? Hold on a second.  I just want to talk about it more? Honestly, I don\\'t have the time. This stock is blowing up right now. The whole firm\\'s going nuts. Hold on. Let me open up the door to my office. Oh, my God! See that, Doc? That\\'s my trading floor. I have calls to make to a million other doctors who are already in the know. I can\\'t walk you through this right now. I\\'m sorry. Okay, okay. Let\\'s do this. Since you\\'re a new account, I can\\'t go higher than 2, shares. I\\'m sorry. 92,000? Are you nuts? That is way beyond what I was thinking. 2,000? Jesus! Listen. I\\'m curious. Why can\\'t you sell me any more than that? Well, we like to establish a relationship with our clients on something small before we get to the more serious trades. Let me show you several percentage points on this small trade and then we\\'ll talk about doing future business. That sounds good. Give me the 2, shares.  Done? You sure you can\\'t do better on this?  I\\'m sorry, Dr. Jacobs. I can\\'t? All right.  We\\'ll start with this trade, then? Great. I promise we\\'ll swing for the fences on the next one. Do you want that confirmation sent to your office or your mansion? Very funny, Mr. Marlin. Let me put my secretary on, and she\\'ll take down your info. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Done and done. Yeah, baby!  So, why\\'d you put a max on his buy? What? Why\\'d you put a max on his buy? You didn\\'t tell him how it works? He\\'s a trainee. He doesn\\'t need to know initial sell limits. Make sure he shows you the ropes, kid. He\\'s too busy callin\\' his bookie. Fuckin\\' Hebrews. Always lookin\\' out for themselves and never the trainees.  Hey, hey? Why don\\'t you go back to Little Italy? Go make me a latke, dreidel boy. Abrams, look me up on the board. The reason I capped him is in case he\\'s a piker. See, we\\'re gonna front the money for this sale and if he doesn\\'t send the check, I\\'m the one holding the bag, follow me? Right. Last commission month, the kid on Jim\\'s team wrote a million-dollar ticket. Stock was down 31/ points by settlement. Fuckin\\' kid took a 1/ million-dollar hit.  Shit? You know how much that hurts? Besides, the first sell just whets the appetite. If he\\'s a whale which it looks like he is then I\\'ll get him on a day when there\\'s a real rip. What\\'s a rip? A commission. That\\'s why we work here. We make huge rips. No, I don\\'t I still don\\'t know how it works. Okay. A two-dollar rip, which is unheard of anywhere on Wall Street means that we\\'re walkin\\' away with two dollars for every share we sell. Real money. That\\'s opportunity. Jesus, Greg, you show him where the bathroom is yet? Yeah, Seth, I showed you where Chris\\'s desk is, right?  Richie, do something with thisHow does Michael afford that?  Couldn\\'t tell you? Okay. If he\\'s doin\\' it, he\\'s makin\\' money on it. Point is: Service your client right, and he\\'ll be back for more. Show him a three-percent return and he\\'ll trust you to watch his kids for the weekend.  Abby? Hey, Seth.  Hi? You wanna go get yourself a drink? Yeah. You want anything? Oh. Okay. I thought this was supposed to be a big broker hangout. Merrill Lynch. Salomon Brothers. Mad, big-dick Steve. What is this place? This looks like the fucking Christmas party at Mutual of Omaha. Yo, check this out. Joe. Oh, my God. Would you look at these monkeys? So, who do you live with? You mean, is the little black girl here takin\\' care of her grandma 5\\'cause her mama\\'s a crackhead? Yeah, exactly. I thought it was smack, though. Right. Boy, you gotta get ahold of that edge. It\\'s kinda sharp. I know. It\\'s just that I get so much shit at J. T that sometimes I have to get in that mode just to fend them off of me, you know? Yeah, I was gonna ask you why are you there because it doesn\\'t seem like the ideal working environment for a black woman. No, it isn\\'t. It\\'s just that how many secretaries do you know that make  grand a year?  One? Exactly.  \"No, no, no. I gotta call the boss.\"Look at this guy. Check it. No way. Vito Corleone. You don\\'t come all my life and then you show up at my daughter\\'s confirmation. \"Are you standin\\' up or sittin\\' down?\" By that time l  How you doin\\'?What\\'s up?  You guys lookin\\' for a broker? Who the fuck are you?  Easy? I\\'m not doin\\' anything. I thought maybe you were lookin\\' for somebody to invest with.  No. Yeah, we\\'re fine. We are brokers? You are?  Yeah? You guys with Jacoby & Jacoby?  J? T. Marlin? Never heard of it. Hold on a second. Who are you? What do you sell? Car insurance? We\\'re with this little firm downtown. Maybe you\\'ve heard of us? J.P. Morgan?  And I\\'m a black Negro? Right. I know J? T. It\\'s a fuckin\\' chop shop. They named it so it sounds like ours. He knows that firm. It\\'s a fuckin\\' chop shop. They named the firm to sound like his. What is he, fucking Yogi Biz?  Shut the fuck up? We\\'re not buying it. And what the fuck is with the suits? You look like you\\'re on Gotti\\'s crew.  You look great. Seriously? Do you know who you\\'re talkin\\' to?  Who are we talkin\\' to? You don\\'t know? Here\\'s Vito and John Jr. I don\\'t wanna get involved in this. We\\'re not bothering you. We\\'re not. Patrick, call out the police. Come on! It\\'s my dad that\\'s the mess but that\\'s not really interesting conversation. What about you? Single mother. No money. And now I take care of her.  What\\'s wrong? She\\'s got chronic pneumonia. You know, she smoked for, like,  years, and now she\\'s really sick. And it\\'s She\\'s just really happy that I have this job so I can support both of us.  But it\\'s scary sometimes, you know? Yeah. What about your father? I don\\'t wanna talk about my father either. Ready? Tell me a story. - What do you wanna hear? I don\\'t know. Tell me Tell me a story about your dad. Well, I have so many great ones. Go on. Tell me. All right. Well, I\\'m ten years old and I just got this new bike. It\\'s a silver Mongoose, you know, like BMX. And I\\'m skidding out in this puddle like Starsky and Hutch.  Right? And my foot slips and the pedal spins around hard enough to break my leg.  Oh, my God? But I don\\'t fall off the bike.  I keep going down this hill? And I get really scared, you know? So I jumped off the bike and I landed behind this parked car. And I was laying there for a good half hour. And finally I hear my father\\'s voice up the street, and he\\'s calling my name. And I was so happy that he was coming to get me. And he comes around the car, and he sees me lying there. I mean, there was there was blood everywhere. Anyway, I look up at him and for the first time in my life, I see how much my father loved me.  \\'Cause he was completely frozen? Wow. You know, it hurt him to see me in that much pain. So he leans down over me and he slaps me across the face. What? Why? I don\\'t know. Maybe he was mad at me for making him feel that helpless or it was the only thing he could think of. I don\\'t really care anymore. What I think of now is the look on his face when he saw me lying there. And that\\'s what I remember. That\\'s what I miss. There\\'s your story. Sorry. All right. I wanna talk to you guys about appearance. Okay? Because most of you dress like shit. I don\\'t know what your financial situation is and I don\\'t want to, but you gotta get yourself at least one decent suit because we have a minimum level of aesthetic professionalism here that we have to maintain. In three months, you can outfit your whole closet but for now get something to hold you over. There\\'s an important phrase we use here. I think it\\'s time you all learned it. \"Act as if.\" Do you understand what that means? Act as if you are the president of this firm. Act as if you got a nine-inch cock. Act as if. And to do that properly, you need to at least look the part. So go get dressed. Secondly, it\\'s time to get your Series Seven books. Don\\'t get nervous. If you study, you\\'ll pass. Then you begin trading as an S? E.C. -licensed broker. Then you\\'re a fucking millionaire, and it\\'s just that simple. I need  bucks from each of you for the books which will be returned if and when you pass the exam. And I need that tomorrow. That is all. What are you? Last night\\'s erection? Yeah, well, you know What\\'s goin\\' on? We\\'re movin\\' to the big house, kids. Isaac here just closed a guy for 30, shares of Farrow Tech. We\\'re on the big board. We\\'re in there now?  Who\\'s out? Todd and company. Come on. Let\\'s go. If you couldn\\'t pull $3, together, your name wouldn\\'t be on my desk. You\\'re embarrassing me. I\\'m pitching you from under my desk. I\\'m embarrassed now. Bob. Bob, be rude. Hang up the phone. You won\\'t. You wanna know why? Because you see value. I am your kids\\' college fund, for chrissakes. I\\'m gonna pass. The only people making money passing are N? F.L. Quarterbacks.  And I don\\'t see a number on your back? Take me off your list. Fine, fine. I\\'m gonna take you off my list of successful people. Hello? Hi, Mr. \"Dahvis,\" this is Ron from the Daily News.  How you doin\\'?It\\'s Davis, and I\\'m not interested. Sorry to bother you. Have a nice day? Wait a minute. Wait. That\\'s your pitch? You consider that a sales call? You know, I get a call from you guys every Saturday and it\\'s always the same half-assed attempt. If you guys wanna close me, you should sell me.  All right? All right. Start again. Okay. Hi, this is Ron from the Daily News.  How you doin\\' this morning? Shitty. What do you want? It\\'s not what I want, sir. It\\'s what you want. Ron, now we\\'re talkin\\'. All right. What are you selling me? I\\'m offering a Daily News subscription at a substantially reduced price. We\\'re trying to reach out to people that never had home delivery before. So everybody who already has a subscription is getting fucked?  Yeah. I guess so? All right. I can handle that. So, why should I buy your paper? I mean, you know Why shouldn\\'t I get the Times or the Voice, you know? The Village Voice is free, sir, so if you want it, you should pick it up. But the Daily News offers you something no other paper can a taste of New York. We have the best features, more photos than any other daily in New York and we have the most reliable delivery in the city. Now what do you think? You know what I think, Ron? I think that was a sales call. Good job, buddy. So you gonna buy a subscription? No. I already get the Times. I know what you\\'re sayin\\'! Booked. Booked. I got a hundred against. Booked. Someone cover Greg. Cover Greg. I hope you guys aren\\'t fightin\\' over it. Here. Good money against Greg\\'s roll.  Put it there? Two hundred?  What is that? Nothing. Damn. Who you gotta ass-fuck to get a ten around here?  There\\'s a leprechaun in stall four? Whatever. Hey, Seth, I\\'m gonna get some reserves. You wanna come with me?  Yeah? You guys want a shot? Roll a seven, baby. Let\\'s go. Quit starin\\' and just apologize. Hey, he doesn\\'t have to say shit, all right? Why don\\'t you go back to your Heineken and shut the fuck up, okay? Was I talkin\\' to you? No, you weren\\'t. You were talkin\\' to him. If you\\'re talkin\\' to him, you\\'re talkin\\' to me and my whole fuckin\\' crew, okay? Get the fuck outta here. What? What? Get the fuck outta here before I put you in a mayonnaise jar, okay? Get the fuck outta here, fuckin\\' cocksucker. He\\'s gonna cry like a little baby! You little baby! Hey, Richie! Hey, Richie! Oh, Mommy! Come on. You gotta realize these aren\\'t the kids you and I grew up with, you know? Remember in Hebrew school, when a shoving match was a big deal? Worst-case scenario, somebody got their yarmulke knocked off. It\\'s true, man. These guys are no joke. They get all tanked up, throw a quick fist. Some of them actually enjoy it. I mean, like, Richie. What the fuck is that, man? Probably thought I was being tough back there with that guy. I was shitting my pants.  I saw that? Oh, great. Thanks. These fuckin\\' Guineas, man. Half of them do coke. They all drink. Zero capital. No fuckin\\' stability. They make all this fucking money and they\\'re always living three steps ahead. You know, there\\'s guys who work at the firm that make a million a year and they can\\'t even get a fucking car loan \\'cause their credit\\'s so bad. It\\'s like everybody is just waiting for the th of the month. They may have a Porsche, but they don\\'t have ten bucks to put in the gas tank.  No shit? It\\'s nigger rich. What is this guy doin\\'? Yo!  All right. Thanks, man? Don\\'t forget what I said about Abby. I think she\\'s trouble, you know? I don\\'t even know what you\\'re talking about. I don\\'t know. I\\'ve just worked there a long time. Just looking out for my friends. I think she\\'s a whore. Just telling you. Well, it\\'s a good thing you stopped dating her, then, right?  I\\'ll see you later? All right. See you. Of all the people at J? T. Marlin, you picked this kid, Davis. Why? 6\\'Cause he\\'s perfect. He\\'s new, so his loyalties don\\'t run too deep. He also seems to be the smartest of this last group of trainees. The rest of them are fuckin\\' idiots compared to this kid. He used to run a full-time casino out of his house in Queens. Now he just picks up the checks. He\\'ll turn state\\'s, no question. How are you gonna get to him? We started surveillance. We\\'ll get to him. Hey, Jeff! Hey, Jeff, get up here! What\\'s goin\\' on? One week I can understand, but it\\'s approaching five weeks now and the profits are down 40% since the last week I was here full-time. I\\'m not you. I\\'m not gonna fuckin\\' kill myself for half the profit. You get to come in here and just pick up your fuckin\\' money, and it sucks. What? Hey! Hey, you know what? This is my business. You used to make ten dollars an hour. Now you\\'re making 1, a week, and you\\'re still not happy?  What the fuck is going on? Nothin\\'. You can check the tapes. For what? I didn\\'t say anything. Are you skimming? No! No, I\\'m not skimming, all right? I can\\'t handle a  hour gig all by myself. This isn\\'t fuckin\\' Denny\\'s. You know? I\\'m tryin\\' to finish school here, man. All right. All right, so Look, why don\\'t you do this? Why don\\'t you take on another partner and you can split your share with him, which I\\'ll up to 65% and then you can go to school during the day and work at night. I\\'m already doin\\' that.  You are? Yeah. I took Dave on last month. And you still can\\'t fuckin\\' handle it?  It\\'s a lot of work? Fuck! Fuck. All right, that\\'s it. It\\'s over. I\\'m shutting it down. And get those kids out of my fuckin\\'house. By delaying, you simply restrict my ability to do my job. Am I? I\\'m not trying to Look, I didn\\'t get to where I am today by losing my clients\\' money. Put your confidence in myself and J? T. Marlin and I\\'m telling you, we\\'ll never have to ask for it again. Put your confidence in myself and J? T. Marlin and I\\'m telling you, you will never have to ask for it again. Okay, let\\'s do this. Great. I\\'m gonna pass you on to my secretary. You call me when the stock doubles, all right? Sheryl, make it so, baby! All right. So I got into it. Do you know how good it feels to close someone? To sell someone? It\\'s amazing.  What\\'s goin\\' on? Seth just closed a guy for ten large.  Amazing? Do you see what You\\'re one of us now. You popped your cherry!  Hey, Seth, come here a second? Yeah. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.  I just closed a huge account for you? Come here. What are you doing? Get away from me. What the fuck are you doing?  What is this? Huh? What? Who told you you could close your own accounts?  What? You violated an S? E.C. Regulation. You\\'re a fucking trainee. You know, I just figured I\\'d take the initiative and, you know, make you some money. Greg, I was standing right next to him the whole time. I would\\'ve stepped right in if the kid would have gotten in trouble. You got a cannoli you can stick in your mouth? No, you got a menorah you can shove in your ass? Fuck him. Come on. I don\\'t even give a fuck about the money, okay? Do you know what would happen if every trainee started handling their own recos?  The shop would be closed in a week? Is this about something else? What would that be? Great. Don\\'t you have to go answer the phones or something? You know what? Fuck it. We\\'ll deal with this later. Don\\'t tell me that\\'s why I\\'m not hitting it anymore. Oh, honey, you were never hitting it and he\\'s not the reason, Greg. You are. Jesus Christ, they\\'re all the same.  What\\'s the same? Oh, my God. You scared me. I\\'m sorry. How long have you been standing there? I just walked up. I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t mean to scare you. No, no, that\\'s all right. Interesting reading? This? No, this is just the prospectus from the last I? P.O. The firm put out. I know what it is. I was just asking if you thought it was interesting. You know, you might be the first person to read a J? T. Prospectus. Really? Yeah. So, what are you looking for? I\\'m just looking for some chocolate love. You know what? Would you like me to practice my pitch?  \\'Cause I know it turns you on? Oh, God. You know, I saw John Feiner shredding a bunch of documents the other day. You don\\'t think that\\'s weird? You say you like the hard sell and the money.  Yeah? Yeah. And then you question it the minute you see something a bit off. No, I\\'m serious. Either you need to admit to yourself that it\\'s not charity work and enjoy it, or get out. But you cannot keep going back and forth like this. It\\'s ridiculous. Can you buy a bigger bed when you get some money, please? How big is your bed? Bigger than this one. You have a huge bed?  Hello? Hi, Harry. Seth Davis at J. T. Marlin.  How are you doing this morning? Fine, thanks. You got a call from an associate last month. I wanted to know if you enjoyed the information we sent you. What information? If you get as much mail as I do, you probably brushed it aside. But more importantly, we made a commitment to get back to you. Listen, I\\'m presenting you with an investment opportunity that I think you\\'ll find interesting. I\\'m not in the market for that. Tell me, Harry, are you married or are you happy? Actually, I\\'ve been married for ten years. Oh, yeah? That\\'s great. Yeah, six years for me. So, listen. Are you playing the market at all? I don\\'t know about playing. I do own some blue chips. They were actually wedding gifts from friends. Listen, we have an explosive situation going on right now. A pharmaceutical company, Farrow Tech has a drug called Parattin in the third stage of F? D.A. Approval.  What\\'s it do? That\\'s a good question. That\\'s a very good question, and this is the best part. It helps premature babies develop properly.  That sounds like a good drug? It is. It is. So, those blue chips you own, what have they done since you got married?  Not that much, really? We deal in stocks that really move. Oh, yeah. They really move. I\\'d love to show you what I mean, and I can do so on a small investment. I really can\\'t buy anything right now. My wife and I are getting ready to buy a house this month and we\\'re trying to save every last penny. Look, I don\\'t care how much stock you pick up. I just want you to test me out. I want you to judge me on the percentages I show you. I show you  or 40%, no matter how big or small your position is you\\'re gonna get excited about my next idea, right?  Yeah? You\\'d hand out my business cards. Right? Do this: Pick up a hundred shares. It\\'s the absolute firm minimum. If I show you three or four points on the trade, it\\'s not gonna make you rich. On the same token, if the stock doesn\\'t go anywhere you\\'re not in front of your store with a cup in your hand.  No, that\\'s true? Look, the truth of the matter is I could sell you more than  shares and feel completely comfortable about the trade. But I\\'m asking you to start small just to prove what I can do for you. All right. Let\\'s try it. Great. Should I send the confirmation to your business or your home? I need to talk to my wife. No, you don\\'t need to do that. I\\'ll call you right back.  I\\'m goin\\' to lunch in five minutes? I need to talk to her first.  Harry, you\\'re at work, aren\\'t you? Yeah. What do you do for a living? I\\'m a purchasing manager at a gourmet foods company.  Does yourjob involve decisions? Of course. When you\\'re making decisions, do you call your wife and ask her what to do? Of course not. But that\\'s a little different. How is that different? It\\'s your money. You earned it. All you\\'re doing is investing it. I\\'m not selling crack here. She\\'s only gonna be happy when she sees that you made a wise investment for the family. Just think of the flip side. When your wife does the shopping does she call you to find out if she can use a coupon for Cap\\'n Crunch?  Now, come on. That\\'s not being fair? No, I know. Look, Harry. I\\'m just trying to make a point here. Look, we\\'re not talking about a lot of money here. Just think what she\\'ll say when you bring home a big fat check because you had the foresight to see a good thing coming.  All right. Let\\'s try it? Good man, Harry. You made a great decision, all right? Hold on a second. Do it. Hello?  Yo? Hey, what\\'s up? You passed the Series Seven. Decide where we\\'re celebrating tonight. I was thinking that we should go to the city tonight 04\\'cause we\\'re always drinking at those shitty local bars. I think we should go to a decent bar with some decent poo-poo. If I have to look at one more housewife smoking a Newport I think I\\'m gonna puke. Let me round up the guys. We\\'ll come pick you up.  All right? You got it. Okay, bye. This guy probably got more rooms in there than he\\'s ever even been in. Look at it. It\\'s fuckin\\' huge. Hey, Chris, why do you still live with your mother? What do you mean? Do you ever wonder how we make the rips that we do? How is it that we make rips that pay out more than any other major firm? You\\'re kidding me, right? That\\'s the wrong That\\'s the wrong question to be asking.  Why? The only thing to worry about is how you\\'re gonna get laid tonight. No, I\\'m serious. Don\\'t you know that S? E.C. Regulations state that the maximum rip allowed is five percent of the sale and we\\'re making, like, four times that? You just passed your Series Seven; now you\\'re an inspector or something?  Aren\\'t you happy with things? Yeah, of course. No, I\\'m just curious. You\\'re not curious? Not at all. I like being a millionaire. And you will too, believe me.  What\\'s up? You need help?  With what? Getting into the fuckin\\' child\\'s seat. Come on. Shotgun. Why did the feminist cross the road? To suck my fuckin\\' cock.  That\\'s funny? Damn straight.  Order me another one? Who U? A.T.\\'d this beer for me?  I did. What\\'s up? I hate it. Send the shit back.  What\\'s a U? A. T? Unauthorized trade. Seth, anything killing you yet? All right, yeah. You know what I fuckin\\' hate? Is getting past the secretaries. It doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re a broker. It\\'s still a sales call, and they fuckin\\' know that.  One day I\\'m gonna open a firm? Hold on a second. You\\'re opening things now? Kid just passed his test; now he knows everything. What\\'s wrong with you? You haven\\'t even popped your cherry yet. Hey, whatever. Let\\'s toast the slut. Here you go. Bring it up for the kid. Highest Series Seven score this month. Big swinging dick, enjoy it while it lasts. Do you guys think you could just try and keep it down some? You guys are at a ten. We could use you at a two.  You got to be kidding me? I\\'m sorry about that. Why don\\'t you just concentrate on your food instead of us, all right? What are you guys eating? A tube steak smothered in underwear? Hey, great outfits. You guys coming from a city council meeting or are you trying to get lucky with the bridge-and-tunnel crowd? You tell \\'em, girl. You know what they should do with you guys? They should throw all of you on a fucking island somewhere.  Oh, yeah. Hey, guess what? What? You\\'re on it. He got a point. Way to go, girl. Here you go. You take it. Hey, Harry, who\\'s J? T. Marlin? I forgot to tell you. I bought a little bit of stock. What\\'d you buy? It\\'s this pharmaceutical company. It\\'s poised for a big jump. They make a new drug that helps premature babies survive the first three months. That\\'s great. Yeah, that\\'s great.  So how much did you buy? Nothing crazy. Just  shares.  At what price? Eight dollars. It\\'s okay. Relax. Okay. So, how\\'d you even know who to call?  Actually, he called me? Who did? Seth Davis, the broker. He\\'s a really great guy. He\\'s a family man, actually. How did he get your name?  I have no idea? Doesn\\'t that worry you? It\\'s just It\\'s okay. Relax, all right?  Okay? It\\'s a small investment. And I\\'m just testing this guy out. If he doesn\\'t show us any gains, I won\\'t do business with him again. Okay. I don\\'t know why the hell I walked in there. Things were going well for me. I had passed the Series Seven and was closing my  accounts for Greg. I didn\\'t wanna go in. I really didn\\'t. But part of me had to know what Michael was doing in there the week before. And why would they be walking into the building next door? The place was empty. I should\\'ve just let it go.  Do we have parking? Again? Why? I want the garage. Do we have the same security guy or what?  Are these hooked up? Yeah. All that stuff. If the heat comes and we have to jump, how long will it take to move the firm?  Under two hours, literally? Everything.  They\\'ll can make calls that afternoon? Okay. All right. I gotta get back to that phone call, but My first thought was that we were moving to nicer offices. Nice thought. I came to realize it was a quick out for Michael if things got out of hand. Miss Halprin. Special Agent Drew, F? B.I. This is Agent Etkin. We\\'d like to talk to you about your relationship with Seth Davis and about your mother\\'s health. Didn\\'t take me long to close the  accounts. I was closing five a day, sometimes six. Just killing it. Greg certainly didn\\'t make it easy, though. But I was focused. I was about to start making the serious dough. I was about to be on my own. All right. At the house. Sheryl. Yes! My first whale. My first account. My book, baby. Seth, I hate to bust in on your little victory speech but that\\'s your th account. I\\'m out of the junior broker program. I don\\'t work for you no more. That\\'s true. You\\'re out, but that account\\'s mine. What? Fuck that. No, I keep the th.  No, you don\\'t? What? Wait a minute. Is this about Abby? Are you that fucking bitter? I made a lot of money for you in the past three months. More than any other trainee. You\\'re not listening to me, all right? I couldn\\'t do it if I wanted to. What Rules are rules, man. Oh, man! Don\\'t be a dick. You know you can bend the rules. I gave each one of my guys their th. Come on. Do me a favor. Shut your fucking mouth. Okay? I\\'m not talking to you. You know what? Fuck you. Fuck you! You\\'re on my team. You understand that? I am not on yours. Don\\'t you ever forget that, bitch. How\\'s everybody doing? I wanted to congratulate you all on a huge month. For any of you not yet convinced these were the top dogs of the month: Jim Young, $280,000; Chris Varick, $205,000; and Greg Weinstein, $190,000. This month\\'s gonna be bigger. It\\'s actually gonna be the biggest month we ever had. I got a new issue I wanna talk to you about. Okay? It\\'s called Med Patent. They just designed the world\\'s first retractable syringe. That means that nurses and doctors will never again have to worry about infection from dirty needles. This is not going to be an alternative in the medical world. This is gonna be the standard. We all know that we\\'re here to make money. But if we can do something good like this, it\\'s all the better. So I want you to go out and buy yourselves a new car. Go buy yourself a house. Go into debt. You are gonna make a million dollars inside of six months. Now onto matters of recreation. We\\'re gonna take a class trip tonight. So call your moms and tell them not to wait up! We\\'re players now, boys! Let\\'s celebrate! Salute! What\\'s wrong? Nothin\\'. Seth, I know you. Just work. It\\'s your father, isn\\'t it? No, no, everything\\'s great with my dad. He\\'s taking me out to lunch next week on his request.  Do you know how happy that makes me? I do. You know I mean, it\\'s all based on this job this very legitimate, respectable job that he can tell his friends about during the Yom Kippur appeal. But I\\'ll take it. I mean Oh, fuck. I\\'m so fuckin\\' close. You know? And I\\'m fucking it up. I mean, l How are you fucking it up? I went to the Med Patent office this morning, and there isn\\'t one. It\\'s cardboard. There\\'s nothing. There\\'s no employees. There\\'s no research and development. Nothing. I found out how Michael\\'s making his money. We\\'re selling stock for companies that don\\'t exist.  Do you know what bridge financing is? No. Basically, it\\'s a way to raise capital for a company that\\'s trying to go public. They get money from outside investors. They\\'re the bridge. And it\\'s perfectly legal as long as there\\'s no connection between the investors and the firm. But Michael\\'s fronting his friends as the investors on every I? P.O. We do. So that\\'s why all the names on the contracts are the same. Right. Then he has us push it all on the open market. We\\'re basically selling Michael\\'s shares. That\\'s where the two-dollar rips come in. He can pay us that much, and it\\'s worth it for him because he depends on us to literally create the market for him. There\\'s no other firm selling this shit. It\\'s all artificial demand. As soon as we sell off his position there\\'s no need to maintain the inflated price anymore.  We stop pushing it, and thenAnd then it crashes. Right. But, I mean, how does that really affect me? I\\'m just selling stock. There\\'s nothing wrong with that. So I know now how Michael makes his own money. And I know that I\\'m not working at Goldman Sachs but we already know that. So how does this really change anything? I don\\'t know, Seth. You tell me. What? J? T. Marlin. How may I direct your call? I think I\\'ll just talk to you. Why are you calling me here? Time\\'s running out, Abby. I need to know what he\\'s doing. You know what? I\\'m getting a little bit tired of this. I don\\'t even know why I talked to you. You have nothing on me. I\\'m gonna hang up this phone now. You\\'re putting all the deals through. Your signature\\'s on every sell ticket. So go ahead, hang up. We\\'ll send a car over for you this afternoon. Goddamn it, you fuckin\\' guys! I\\'m gonna keep this short, okay? You passed your Sevens over a month ago. Seth\\'s the only one that\\'s opened  accounts for his team leader. When I was a junior broker, I did it in  days. Okay? You\\'re not sending out press packets anymore. None of this \" Debbie the Time-Life operator\" bullshit. So get on the phones! It\\'s time to get to work! Get off your ass! Move around! Motion creates emotion! I remember one time I had this guy call me up, wanted to pitch me. Right? Wanted to sell me stock, so I let him. I got every fuckin\\' rebuttal out of this guy. Kept him on the phone for an hour and half. Towards the end, I asked him questions like, \"What\\'s the firm minimum?\" That\\'s a buying question. Right there, that guy\\'s gotta take me down. It\\'s not like \"What\\'s your  number?\" That\\'s a fuck-off question. I was giving him a run, and he blew it. To a question like, \"What is the firm minimum?\" The answer is zero. You don\\'t like the idea; don\\'t pick up a single share. But this putz is telling me, you know, \"Uh,  shares.\" Wrong answer! No! You have to be closing all the time! And be aggressive. Learn how to push. Talk to \\'em. Ask \\'em questions. Ask \\'em rhetorical questions. It doesn\\'t matter. Anything. Just get a \"yes\" out of \\'em. \"If you\\'re drowning and I throw a life jacket, would you grab it?\" \" Yes!\" \"Good. Pick up  shares. I won\\'t let you down.\" Ask \\'em how they\\'d like to see 0, 40% returns. What are they gonna say? \"No\"? \"Fuck you\"? \"I don\\'t wanna see those returns\"? Stop laughing. It\\'s not funny. If you can\\'t learn to close, you better start thinking about another career. And I am deadly serious about that. Dead fuckin\\' serious! And have your rebuttals ready. A guy says, \"Call me tomorrow\"? Bullshit! Somebody tells you they got money problems buying  shares is lying. You know what I say to that? I say, \" Look, man. Tell me you don\\'t like my firm. Tell me you don\\'t like my idea. Tell me you don\\'t like my necktie. But don\\'t tell me you can\\'t put together 2, bucks.\" And there is no such thing as a no-sale call. A sale is made on every call you make. Either you sell the client some stock, or he sells you on a reason he can\\'t. Either way, a sale is made. The only question is, \"Who\\'s gonna close?\" You or him? And be relentless. That\\'s it. I\\'m done. When I say this man was a loser, I was saying to myself \"What are you doing getting involved with a divorcé?\" It didn\\'t work the first time, it won\\'t work the second. That\\'s your phone.  I should let you go. I\\'ll scoot? Yes?  Hi, Harry. How you doing? Seth, did you get my calls? Yeah, I\\'m sorry. It\\'s just been crazy around here. What\\'s happening with Farrow Tech? It\\'s down five points. I think we should  I wanna sell it? You wanna sell now? The stock\\'s down. You don\\'t make money buying high and selling low. So what\\'s going on? Tell me why we shouldn\\'t get out now. All right. Here\\'s the deal. I told you things would happen in  days. It\\'s only been  so far. The situation here is explosive, and I wanted to get you involved. I\\'ve been busy gathering information. The stock\\'s down for tech reasons. It just came off the restricted list, but it\\'s still the same company. As a matter of fact, Farrow\\'s been doing nothing but signing more contracts.  It\\'s looking like our next big one? Guys, listen up. Harry, I\\'m sorry. Can you hold on a second? Hey! Shut the fuck up! I just got word from Michael. The rip on Farrow Tech is now three dollars. Harry, listen to this. Jesus Christ. What\\'s going on over there? See what I\\'m saying? People know! The whole place is going nuts. It\\'s already up a point, and it just came off the restricted list. I\\'m advising all my clients to get in on this, and heavy. You get the same stock we picked up at eight, only now it\\'s at four.  When it was at 8, I said it\\'d go to 20.Yes, you did. It\\'s still going there, probably higher. This doesn\\'t change anything except you\\'re making more money than you did before. I liked it at eight. I love it at four. It\\'s an average down for you.  A what? It\\'s called dollar-cost averaging. If you own  shares at  dollars, and you pick up another  at . that\\'s  shares at 7. a share. If I get you involved at 10, I take you out at . how many points did I make you?  Five? Exactly. But at seven and a half if I take you out at 15, that\\'s 71/ points.  That\\'s better, isn\\'t it? Yeah, but l Let me close the door to my office. One second. I also have a bullet on it. A few days ago, Dan Dorfman on CNBC put a heavy buy recommendation on Farrow Tech. Listen to me. I just called a broker friend at another firm and had him pick me up 50, shares under my sister-in-law\\'s name. I\\'m gonna put all my kids through college with this stock. I have 1, more calls to make. I have to call every one of my clients and give \\'em the same opportunity. You remember when we first spoke? I told you that this firm only has six or seven great ideas a year? Well, this is one of those ideas. I remember you saying something about wanting to buy a house, right? Yeah. How\\'d you like to pay for it tomorrow in cash?  Are you serious? Serious as cancer. Okay, all I have is the 50, from our savings account. Seth, you got a call on line three. Look, that\\'s my secretary. I have to go. What\\'s it gonna be, Harry? This kid is really good. God, he\\'s gonna go down hard. You think I wanna live in this apartment the rest of my life? Sometimes I wonder. I\\'m the one that got the raise. Try and remember that.  I\\'m the one that goes out every dayYou can\\'t keep using that. I\\'ve told you a million times that I will get a job. But you forbid it, then you use it against me. We\\'ll buy the house! With what? That was our savings, remember? The stock\\'s gonna go up! Seth promised! No, get out of it. Sell it all tomorrow morning. I spoke to Howard Goldberg over at Prudential. You lied again, you unbelievable piece of shit. You lied to all of us. He told me about J? T. Marlin. It\\'s a chop shop, Seth. You\\'ve been selling their shit all this time. How many people have you fucked over? Tell me. How many? All that bullshit about them wanting you to know how the business works. The great training program, remember? All the profits you made for your customers? Did you do anything for them? Did you make them any money at all? Oh, God. I\\'m done with you, Seth. This is it. I\\'ve had it. I don\\'t wanna see you again. I don\\'t want you to come to the house. I don\\'t want you to call. This is worse than the casino. You\\'ve been stealing. Look at me. You\\'re destroying people\\'s lives. I\\'m telling you, he\\'s about to make a move. No! I can\\'t afford to leave him out there any longer. This girlfriend of his may have already tipped him off.  He could run at any time? She hasn\\'t, sir. How could you possibly know that? And if you\\'re right and she\\'s so loyal to you then why hasn\\'t she given us any information yet? I want Davis brought in by the end of the week. Period. There\\'ll be a lot of heat coming down \\'cause of what Farrow Tech did. So be smart on the phone. Calm people down. The stocks dropped 86% from yesterday\\'s close. I don\\'t want people dumping their shares, understand? Isaac, I got a Mr. Klastow. He\\'s super hot. Fuck! I gotta deal with this guy now? You wanna transfer your account out? Go ahead. You\\'re gonna transfer to some broker who doesn\\'t owe you shit. I\\'m sorry we couldn\\'t foresee this when we first came to you with the stock. I lost you $60,000. There is no one who wants to make that money back for you more than I. When\\'s the last time you closed something? You couldn\\'t close a fuckin\\' window, you moron! What the fuck is this? What is this? You think I\\'m gonna sign a sell ticket for you? What\\'d I just say? Get him back on the phone and explain the situation to him. Get on the phone! No one is gonna unload today, you hear me? No one. You\\'re a mutt. Seth, I\\'ve got a Harry Reynard on the phone. Yeah, put him through.  Hi, Harry. I was gonna call you? I want my money back.  Look, Harry,I know you\\'re pissed. We had a setback, but don\\'t worry. It\\'s become a gold stock. I plan to bring you eight or nine points over the course of this year. People are talking about it like it\\'s the next Microsoft. Listen, I\\'m in a heap of trouble here. I need that money back. It was supposed to be a down payment for a house for my family and now we\\'re gonna lose the house.  It\\'s gonna rebound? Seth, I need the money back! I\\'m sorry, Harry. I can\\'t do that. Please, Seth, I need the money back! I have to go. Hello? Hello? If he calls back, I\\'m not here. J? T. Marlin.  Seth Davis? May I ask who\\'s calling?  It\\'s Harry Reynard? He just stepped out for a meeting. Oh, God! Damn it! I wish my dad could\\'ve stepped into the casino just once. He would\\'ve had to be impressed. Four employees, an organized payroll, huge client list. It\\'s funny looking back. The illegal business I was running was the most legitimate thing I had going. I looked my customers in the eye and provided a service they wanted. Now, I don\\'t even look at my customers and I push them something they never asked for. What are you doing here, Seth? I thought I told you I didn\\'t want to see you again. I need to talk to you. What is it? I want out of the firm. Great. Leave. I don\\'t care what you do anymore. I\\'ll tell you this, your coming here is unacceptable to me.  Do you want to cost me my judgeship? No. I can\\'t have any connection to you. I wanna get out of the firm like you told me to.  I just need your help? What do you need my help for? You\\'re getting out. Fine. Whatever. I don\\'t care if you stay there or not. Just get out of here! I wanted to There was this investment that I wanted to tell you about. Oh, Seth. Please. You\\'ve gotta be kidding me. No I mean, you can make a lot of money.  Seth, you listen to meWe could make a couple big trades that J? T. Marlin wants you to invest in and then when the next I? P.O. Comes out No, stop. Are you asking me to go in on a stock scam with you? What, are you out of your fucking mind? Are you nuts? Listen. I think it\\'s time for you to Do you remember this day? Yes, of course. I bought you that bike. Do you remember what happened about a month after that? All right. What is it? What do you want from me? Do you remember when I broke when I broke my leg? Yes, Seth, I remember you broke your leg. What is it? You were hysterical! I had to get you to stop! My fucking leg was broken. I\\'m sorry I\\'m sorry I couldn\\'t get the job that you wanted me to have. But I mean Who gives a shit? 49\\'Cause I\\'m good at what I do, Dad. I\\'m good at what I do! And the casino The casino was a fucking business and I ran it pretty fuckin\\' well, Dad!  And to think that I closed it for you!Wait, wait. Wait. When did you close it? And then I got this job \\'cause I thought it was what you wanted me to be doing! Seth, wait a second. When did you close it? And I tried I tried to make the changes that you wanted me to! And I\\'m leaving J? T. Now! I\\'m just asking you for this one thing. Just this one thing, please! Help your son! I can\\'t, Seth. I can\\'t. I\\'m sorry. What are you gonna do now? I\\'m still gonna do it. I have a friend that\\'ll go in with me. If I do it right, I can take J? T. For at least  grand.  My father can go to hell? Seth, my mom.  I\\'m sorry? I don\\'t think you should do it.  I think you should just quit? I told you I\\'ve invested too much time in this. I have no more money coming in anymore because Jeff tanked my fucking gold mine. I need this. I could hook you up with my friend that works over at Smith Barney.  I know you can get a job there? Doing what? Ticket running? You think coming from J? T. Marlin, they\\'ll let me trade? No fuckin\\' way. Why are you so against this? What do you care if I pull this off? This is gonna be great for both of us. Seth, I just have a bad feeling about all this.  I gotta go? Seth, I need to talk to you. I\\'ve just got to figure something out. I need to tell you something. Please don\\'t walk out. Abby, can you come in here for a second? Yeah, Mom, one sec Seth. Fuck. Mommy, what\\'s going on? Okay. Get that. Let\\'s go.  Mom, where are we going? Let\\'s just go. Yeah, I know. You went too far this time. Well, then, when you\\'d figured it out, you should\\'ve said something. No, he certainly hasn\\'t helped any. But he loves you, Seth. Do you know that? It\\'s important that you know that. Line three.  Seth Davis here? Hi, Seth. How are you?  Dad? Yep. Listen, can I change your mind about doing this I? P.O. Scheme? No, I\\'m sorry. I\\'ve already gone in with somebody. Well, then, I\\'m gonna help you out with this. You\\'re gonna do it with me? No, Seth. You know I can\\'t do that but at least I can make sure you don\\'t get caught. I know somebody over at Ellis Proud and they can talk to you about it. So, why don\\'t you come over to the house tomorrow night? Thank you, Dad. I\\'m so glad you called. Me too. Okay, kiddo. Tomorrow night. Okay. So, do you wanna talk to me, or I mean I don\\'t know what to tell you. Let\\'s think about this whole thing. If you pull this I? P.O. Deal off and I\\'m associated with you, what do you think will happen to me?  But they can\\'t prove anything? Who says they have to? I\\'m gonna lose my job unless I put some distance between us right now. Who cares about that? I\\'m gonna take care of you. Look, you are the one real thing in my life right now. Get out of the car, please. You are under arrest for violation of  S? E.C. And N? A.S? D. Regulations. What the hell is going on out here? Seth, I\\'m gonna get you out of this.  Just don\\'t call my father? Get back in the car, Abby. Why is he here right now? He didn\\'t do anything. Seth, what the hell is going on?  You\\'ve been talking to them about me? Of course not!  What is he doing here right now? Seth, are you sure? Of course I\\'m sure. I didn\\'t say anything. All right. That\\'s it. I am out of here in three seconds unless you can charge me with something. Can I change your mind about doing the I? P.O. Scheme? Well, then I\\'m gonna help you out. I know somebody over at Ellis Proud. At least I can make sure you don\\'t get caught. Oh, my God. So, what do you want from me? I want you to testify.  Well, what are you offering? Full immunity.  And what happens with my father? He won\\'t do any time. Seth, I haven\\'t done anything illegal. So, what\\'s the deal, then? The deal is I lose my judgeship just going along for the ride.  I have nothing to do with that? What\\'s that supposed to mean? Are you gonna release the tape to the press? Makes your case more glamorous with the involvement of a federal judge.  No. No, no. No deal? Why? No, you take my father out the back, and you bring him home. He has nothing to do with this case. I swear to God, if he ends up in one newspaper, I do not testify. And I mean that. For me, it\\'d be worth going to jail for.  You serious? What do you think? Before we get ahead of ourselves, just what are you offering? I\\'m gonna hand you this case on a silver fucking platter. I know everything you don\\'t. I know how it all works. I know how Michael makes his money. I know how he hides it. I know who he goes in with. I even know where he moves if you guys get too close. I know everything! So tell me what happens now. You go back to work tomorrow like nothing happened, for one day. I need your client book and your whole \"C\" drive backed up onto floppy.  And we have to hold you overnight? Just a minute, please. Please, I want a couple of moments alone with my son.  I\\'m sorryDavid, let\\'s give them a moment. I am so sorry. I am so fuckin\\' sorry. Seth, just let me speak. When I came up to you behind that car it was the hardest thing I ever had to bear because all I wanted to do was make your pain disappear. I don\\'t even know how to describe the feeling. I just want you to know one thing. Not a day of my life has gone by that I don\\'t think about that moment that I don\\'t dream about being back there just to have one more chance. I am more sorry than you will ever know. You know that E! \\'s got that bathing suit thing going. French Riviera. It\\'s on tonight. The guy was an idiot. He acted like he was from Staten Island. No Hi, you\\'ve reached the Reynards. Please leave a message. Thanks. Have a nice day. Hey, Harry. It\\'s Seth Davis.  Are you there? Isaac, your mother on line three. You know, about the way things went, I just I found a way to get your money back. I just need you to call me back, all right? George, get me a coffee. Thanks. So call me. What?  Hi? What\\'s up?  I want to talk to you about a client? Yeah.  His name is Harry Reynard? I don\\'t know him. I think you should, because we\\'re about to lose him. He dropped $50, on Farrow Tech this week alone. And you want to do what? I want to keep him here. I think that we should give him a chunk of the Med Patent I? P.O. We don\\'t hand out I? P.O. To somebody who had a bad day on the market. Look, Michael, this guy is a fucking whale and he\\'s gonna do an obscene amount of business with this firm.  You\\'re somehow sure of this? Yeah, the guy completely trusts me. He doesn\\'t even need the money. He owns the biggest foods company in Wisconsin. He just wants to know we\\'re gonna do right by him. How many trades has he made? Two. But he made a second trade a week after I opened him. Look, the guy\\'s pretty fuckin\\' sour on Farrow Tech and he\\'s gonna walk. I just think we need to make him a little money on this next I? P. O and let him take it for a ride. What did Greg say? He\\'s busy closing somebody. I didn\\'t want to bother him. Well, go get him. Hey, Greg. Michael wants to see you. I don\\'t know what he told you, but I\\'ve had it with this shit. This is a business, all right? He should be making calls not in here bitching about personal petty shit between me and him. Seth was talking about giving Med Patent I? P.O. To Harry Reynard. What Are you fucking kidding me? First of all, I don\\'t even know this guy Reynard. No way. He\\'s totally unreliable. What are you doing? Guy dropped  large on Farrow Tech this week. That\\'s great. But I have lots of clients who deserve I? P.O. More than this guy. Clients who\\'ve been with me six months taken losses and continue to trade.  And he\\'s one of \\'em, asshole? You see what I\\'m dealing with here?  What do you mean, \"he\\'s one of them\"?He\\'s one of Greg\\'s clients. What? I opened him when I was closing my  accounts for you. I\\'m just his contact here. He\\'s your client. I\\'m not gonna make a dime off this trade. No wonder the guy\\'s pissed off. His own broker doesn\\'t even know he\\'s a fuckin\\' client here. Fine. Give him 10, shares. He just can\\'t sell it before we say so.  Great. Okay? No joke, Seth. He cannot sell it before we sell it.  At least six months, you understand? Absolutely. Absolutely. Greg, I\\'m sure you don\\'t have a problem with this. Can you get the fuck out of my office? Fine. What the fuck are you doing? Stand up! You cannot sit down for the rest of the fuckin\\' day! You cannot sit down ever again! Okay? Seth, line two.  Hello? It\\'s time, Seth. Get going. I\\'m going to lunch, boys. What\\'s this about? You okay? I need you to sign a sell ticket for a client of mine. Fuck Greg! Let\\'s fuckin\\' deal with  Let\\'s talk to Michael? No, wait. Wait, wait. Chris, I got arrested last night. What? The F? B.I. Arrested me. The F? B. I? Why the fuck would the F? B.I. Arrest you? Because of my involvement in this firm. Your involvement in the firm? What the fuck does that mean? Come on, Chris. You know what that means. No, I don\\'t know what that means. What does that mean?  What the fuck did you tell \\'em? No. No. No, they knew everything, man. They had photographs. They had They had tape-recorded conversations. They brought my father in, you know. I mean  Chris, there was nothing I could do? What did you do? Chris, the F? B.I. Are gonna raid the place in  minutes. What the fuck are you talking about? Fuck, Seth! Come on, man. I asked you for months about shit going down here and you told me to shut the fuck up. You said get ready to be a millionaire! That\\'s right. Shut the fuck up. That\\'s all you had to do. Didn\\'t you learn anything? I learned how to fuck people out of their money. Harry Reynard just lost his life savings. And he wasn\\'t a whale. He was just some poor schmuck, and I took him. I did everything that J? T. Marlin taught me to do and I made up his mind for him. What do you want me to tell you? That\\'s what we do here. What? We lie? We\\'re liars? Seth, this Who are they coming for? They\\'re coming for everybody, everything. You know how hard I worked to get where I am? No, Chris, you need to forget about that. It doesn\\'t mean shit. Right now at this moment is what you should be thinking about. What are you gonna do in the next  minutes? They\\'re gonna come in here, and make sure that we never trade another share of stock for the rest of our lives.  But we can do something? What\\'s that? Harry, my client. I need a senior broker to sign a sell ticket so he can take his shares and dump \\'em on the open market and make his money back. Come on, Chris. Come on. What\\'s the difference? Do one thing right here. Just sign it, please. Thank you, Chris. I\\'m so sorry. I\\'m plagued by \"what ifs\" these days. What if Greg hadn\\'t come over that night? What if I hadn\\'t forgotten my bag or seen Michael walk into the building that day? What if I had skipped over Harry\\'s card? What are the chances? What are the odds? That\\'s what I think about. Hey, I ran a casino. It\\'s the next step I gotta figure out, \\'cause I\\'m no lottery winner. I tried slinging crack rock, and I never had a jump shot. I gotta find a job.'),\n",

Let\\'s talk business. Good idea. What business are we talking about? Good coffee. Well, let\\'s put it this way. Back in new york, i got a computer. Her name is carmen. Every morning, right after i brush my teeth, I punch out, \"carmen, computer on the wall, Who\\'s the fairest of them all?\" Now, most mornings she spits out, \"Garfield, you\\'re the fairest.\" But three weeks ago, she said, \"Garfield, garfield, scratch your balls. \"New england\"Pardon me \"New england wire and cable is the fairest of them all.\" New england wire and cable? I said, \"what\\'s it worth?\" So she showed me the numbers. You got equipment here that cost $ million. Even at salvage, It\\'s worth 30,  million. Can i use that blackboard over there? Yeah, go ahead. Thank you. Come with me. Carmen will educate us. Going to erase this stuff here. Here. Let\\'sLet\\'s put down  million. How many acres you got? 5110. 10. Carmen and i figure even as farmland, Grazing land, it\\'s worth  million. Is that fair? Yeah. Let\\'s lay the  under the 30. That makes  million. All right. And you bought some other companies, Didn\\'t you, bill? You have a plumbing, an electrical, And some kind of adhesive company. Boring, but all making a decent profit. Carmen says they\\'re worth another  mil. Let\\'s put the  under the 40. And you have working capital of  million,  f it in cash. Let\\'s put down  million, add them up, And see what you got.  million. The only bad news is That this wire and cable division Isn\\'t making a profit. And all the other divisions Have to support you. Now, as a stockholder, That doesn\\'t make me very happy. Are you finished, mr. Garfield? No, i\\'m not, bill. Let\\'s say carmen was suffering From premenstrual syndrome. No offense. A little nuts. Let\\'s say she was too optimistic. Let\\'s knock off  million. Here we go. Let\\'s make it  million. A nice round number. I like nice round numbers. Any debt? No. Any lawsuits? Any environmental bullshit? You throwing garbage in the water? Of course not. Not you. What about pension liabilities? Carmen says you\\'re fully funded. You people are dreams. I think this meeting is over. No, no, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Here comes the fun part. How many shares outstanding you got?  million. Divide  million into  million, What do you get? 025. Good. That means each share is worth $25. But that was all foreplay. Let\\'s go for the real thing. The stock was  When i woke up weeks ago. That\\'s a  for a $ Item. What a sale. Something worth $25, i can buy it for 10. The company\\'s not for sale, mr. Garfield. I don\\'t want your company, jorgy. I just want what every other stockholder wants I want to make money. You are making money. You bought the stock at 10. It\\'s now 14. The stock is  because i\\'m buying it. I\\'m doing my part, now you do yours. Get rid of this wire and cable division. It\\'s a financial cancer. Would you excuse us, please? I want to talk to mr.

We\\'re just doing business. Business? With you? I got a company to run. Yeah, well, that\\'s my point. I don\\'t like the way my company\\'s being run! And you better get your elevator fixed! There\\'s a goddamn fire raging here, And this whole industry\\'s up in flames! And you call the fire department, And who shows up? Nobody. Because they\\'re all in japan and singapore And malaysia and taiwan and every other shit hole Where they\\'re crazy about pollution. And while that inferno is raging, You\\'re out in front mowing the lawn, tidying up, Playing with your putz on my money! You\\'d think i was asking him for a loan. Good day, mr. Garfield. I\\'m not a long-Term player. honks] They give us trouble today? They\\'re not going to send us Back to the bronx, arthur. Don\\'t scare me, there, mr. G. Richardson, i want to buy up New england wire and cable. Buy everything you can. File a goddamned D. I want to finish this one quick. Richardson: we\\'re on it. Well, it\\'s official. Our friend garfield\\'s intent Is to take over the company. He\\'s filed his  D With the s? E.C. He now owns 2% of us. What do you want to do? I own 20%. Jorgy, we\\'ve got to protect ourselves. We need legal advice. We have lawyers. They\\'re not equipped to handle this. We need the best. We want to call kate. Let me. What makes you think she\\'ll come? I\\'ll tell her we need her. We\\'re family. Flamboyant ls and ms. Loves to write million, doesn\\'t he? We\\'ve never seen a man like that. He\\'s like something out of a comic book. So they say. Hello, kate. Jorgy. Thanks for coming. Doesn\\'t she look splendid? I have to be back in the city by 5:00. Would you mind if we get right down to it? You\\'re in charge, kate. Now, given that someone\\'s interested In moving in on you, You\\'ve no choice but to protect yourself. You have some options. For openers, i recommend changing Your state of incorporation From rhode island to delaware. Why delaware? That\\'s a good idea. Strong anti-Takeover legislation there. That way we\\'re not playing dead. Who the hell is playing dead? You have to protect yourself. By running away to delaware? It\\'s only on paper. This company was founded in rhode island. It will remain in rhode island. I\\'m talking about delaware, Not nairobi. Come on. I own 20% of this company. The board owns another 5, The employees another 5%. That\\'s 30%. Now how can this man get control? What do you want, For me to negotiate a deal or not? But there\\'s no deal to be made. He\\'s knocking at your door. If you don\\'t answer it, It\\'s the same as inviting him in. Listen to her, jorgy. There\\'s no deal to be made with predators. You kill it or it kills you. Well, what do you suggest? Make it worth his while to leave. How? How? What do you mean? Pay him off. Buy him out at a profit. It\\'s greenmail, jorgy, But it\\'s done all the time. It\\'s terrorism, and i won\\'t do it! Any other options? You\\'re going to lose your company. Like hell i am. You, as they say in the street, Are in play. Garfield put you there, And now i\\'m here as your lawyer. Isn\\'t that a hell of an irony? Me trying to save your company. Well, i can do it. buzzes] Yeah? A miss sullivan From hudson, bradley, and flint is here. And granger wants to discuss trundel canning, And your suits are ready for a fitting. Can they come up at 5:00? Tell \\'em 5: is ok. But tell \\'em not to send The blind son of a bitch With the pins. And tell granger if he wants to see me He\\'d better make sense this time Or he can get on the unemployment line. Shall i use those exact words, sir? Send in hudson, bradley, and flint. Whew. Wow. Whew! You know what kills me? I\\'ve done maybe 7,  deals like this before, And you know who i negotiate with? Skinny little joggers with contact lenses All stinking from the same aftershave. I\\'m kate sullivan. I know your name. Want a cigarette? No, thank you. Don\\'t let me stop you. Why would you stop me? What are you, a fucking lawyer? Depends on who i\\'m with. Welcome to my life. So, what\\'s it going to be? Sue, settle, defend? I came to talk. Boof! Oh, that\\'s trouble. Lawyers want to talk Nothing but trouble. How about a doughnut? No, thanks. Why, are you a health food freak? No. Just not hungry. You have to be hungry to eat a doughnut? You don\\'t? What, are you shitting me? All my life i never heard such a thing. Have to be hungry. Why? It don\\'t taste better that way. How would you know? What do you want? I need a month. Get lost. I just got involved. I need time To get everybody\\'s act together. My act is together. If you give me some time, I think we can work something out. Settle? Work something out. I only settle when i\\'m in trouble. Or when it makes sense. It only makes sense when i\\'m in trouble. Well, if you prefer, we\\'ll go to court. Get an injunction, have a fight. All kinds of allegations. Costs them, costs you, and for what? I live in court. You got to do better than that. I won\\'t love you anymore. Two weeks. Standstill agreement. Both sides. No more buying. Two weeks. Thank you. Whoa, whoa! Where are you going? We haven\\'t talked about what i want to talk about. What\\'s that? You and me sweatin\\' between satin sheets. Garfield, Put your hand between your legs. Do it! Good. Look directly down at that little guy, And you say, \"you must behave yourself When you\\'re in the presence of a lady.\" Garfield, you don\\'t say exactly that right now I\\'m resigning from this case. You must behave yourself You must behave yourself When you\\'re in the presence When you\\'re in the presence Of a lady. See? Not so hard. See you in two weeks. Wow! Did you see that, carmen? I love it, love it, love it. Goodbye, miss sullivan. Goodbye. Call erickson, tell him to arrange some money Through the royal bank. Don\\'t pay him more than we did on fleetwood. Then call hathaway, tell him I want to make a tender offer For new england wire and cable. Don\\'t put it under our name. Label it \"opm holdings.\" But what if she finds out we broke the agreement? Richardson, were you born yesterday? What do you think she\\'s doing as we speak? That kewpie doll\\'s up to no good. Do it. I got us an extra two weeks. Now we have to move fast. Get the board to buy up as many shares as they can. Use your own working capital. Andrew: no, no, that\\'s not what those dollars are for. That\\'s our safety net. Then borrow the money. No borrowing. Andrew, listen to her. She\\'s making sense. For every share you acquire, It\\'s one less for garfield. The more we buy, the less for him. The more it costs, the less profit he makes. So get the stock up. Oh, and mom, make sure to buy it through An out-Of-State broker. I don\\'t want to borrow money. We\\'ve been debt-Free since the depression. But see, that\\'s the trouble. It\\'s your gorgeous balance sheet That makes you so attractive. Oh, and mom, get letters out to the shareholders. Tell them how great business is, And how wonderful the future looks. I\\'ll do it. Great. I\\'ll call you tomorrow. Good night. Mmm. Mmm good morning, honey. How you doing this morning, huh? Oh Ooh You got it up again. Another point and a half. Pfeiffer. Good morning, mr. Garfield. Woody. Good morning. Harriet. Miss sullivan is gonna call tomorrow morning. You tell her i\\'m not taking calls. Then when she comes over here And tries to storm into the office, You try to keep her out. But then you can let her push past. Don\\'t worry, she\\'s desperate but harmless. Find out where she lives and call the florist. Florist? Florist. You have a good evening, miss sullivan. Hello, michael. Oh, miss sullivan. Uh Here. Somebody brought these by for you. Oh, thank you. Good night. Good night. Good morning. Good morning. Oh! You ruthless son of a bitch! Excuse me? Jeez, what\\'s her problem? Uhh! All right, all right. Sorry to get in your way. May i help you? I\\'m afraid mr. Garfield isn\\'t in. I don\\'t care! It\\'s all right, harriet. No, it\\'s not all right, you hypocrite! You lied! Oh. But babypoo We had an agreement. We had a standstill! No more buying! You know nothing about opm holdings? Opm? Not much to know. You broke the agreement! You embarrassed me with my firm And with my clients! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don\\'t come on so holier-Than-Thou with me. What am i supposed to do, sit her and twiddle my thumbs While you drive up the price of the stock? I did no such thing. You\\'re full of shit. All that buying coming from some little firm In rhode island? You\\'d think you\\'d use an out-Of-State firm. I know nothing about that. Give me a break. Who am dealing with here, mother teresa? You want to play the game, Learn to play it right. Oh, is that what you call it, a game? You\\'re damn right. The best game in the world. I\\'ll teach you. It\\'s easy. You make as much as you can For as long as you can. And then what? \"And then what?\" Whoever has the most when he dies, wins. Look. It\\'s the american way. I\\'m doing my job. I\\'m a capitalist. I\\'m simply following the law Of free enterprise. What law is that? Survival of the fittest. Well, maybe some people don\\'t see it that way. Maybe they don\\'t see it as survival of the fittest. Maybe they see it as survival of the fattest! Oh, katie, why are you so hard on me? 7\\'Cause you\\'re not nice. Since when do you have to be nice to be right? You\\'re not right.

If the charges were dropped, it\\'s a technicality. He was required to disclose. Gerber\\'s in prison, richard. Judge pollard ain\\'t going to give you A restraining order based on a technicality.

What are your plans For new england wire and cable? Make the stockholders richer. Will you liquidate new england wire and cable? And if so, what about the workers? My obligation is to the stockholders. The board of directors make that decision. Will they lose their jobs? Come on, answer the question. Come on, mr. Garfield! How do you feel about The outcome of today\\'s proxy vote? I feel confident That the shareholders will vote their consciences. I have every confidence in this company\\'s future. Could i have your attention, please? Welcome to New england wire and cable\\'s annual stockholders\\' meeting. I\\'m william j. Coles, your president And i\\'m sure I\\'m sure that everyone here realizes The most important item on the agenda is The election of the board of directors. Now, there are staff members Passing out the ballots. Right now, i am very proud To introduce to you a man Who could accurately be characterized As a legend in the wire and cable industry. The chairman of the board Of new england wire and cable, Mr. Andrew jorgenson. Give \\'em hell, andy! It\\'s good to see so many Familiar faces, so many old friends. Some of you i haven\\'t seen in years. Thank you for coming. Bill coles, our able president, In the annual report has told you of our year, Of what we accomplished, Of the need for further improvements, Our business goals for next year And the years beyond. I\\'d like to talk to you about something else. I want to share with you some of my thoughts Concerning the vote that you\\'re going to make In the company that you own. This proud company, Which has survived the death of its founder, Numerous recessions, One major depression, And two world wars, Is in imminent danger of self-Destructing On this day, in the town of its birth. There is the instrument of our destruction. I want you to look at him in all of his glory Larry the liquidator. The entrepreneur of post-Industrial america Playing god with other people\\'s money. The robber barons of old At least left something tangible in their wake A coal mine, a railroad, banks. This man leaves nothing. He creates nothing. He builds nothing. He runs nothing. And in his wake lies nothing But a blizzard of paper To cover the pain. Oh, if he said, \"I know how to run your business better than you,\" That would be something worth talking about. But he\\'s not saying that. He\\'s saying, \"i\\'m going to kill you \"Because at this particular moment in time, You\\'re worth more dead than alive.\" Well Maybe that\\'s true, But it is also true That one day this industry will turn, One day when the yen is weaker, The dollar is stronger, Or when we finally begin to rebuild our roads, Our bridges, The infrastructure of our country, Demand will skyrocket. And when those things happen, We will still be here, Stronger because of our ordeal, Stronger because we have survived. And the price of our stock Will make his offer pale by comparison. God save us If we vote to take his paltry few dollars and run. God save this country If that is truly the wave of the future. We will then have become a nation That makes nothing but hamburgers, Creates nothing but lawyers, And sells nothing but tax shelters. And if we are at that point In this country Where we kill something Because at the moment It\\'s worth more dead than alive, Well, Take a look around. Look at your neighbor. Look at your neighbor. You won\\'t kill him, will you? No. It\\'s called murder, And it\\'s illegal. Well, this, too, is murder, On a mass scale. Only on wall street, They call it maximizing shareholder value. And they call it legal. And they substitute dollar bills Where a conscience should be. Damn it! A business is worth more Than the price of its stock. It\\'s the place where we earn our living, Where we meet our friends, Dream our dreams. It is, in every sense, The very fabric that binds our society together. So let us now, at this meeting, Say to every garfield in the land, Here we build things, We don\\'t destroy them. Here we care about more Than the price of our stock. Herewe care about people. Thank you. And now i\\'d like to introduce Mr. Lawrence garfield. Excuse mePlease. Let\\'s show a little courtesy, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Garfield is the president And the chairman of the board of Garfield investments. Mr. Garfield. No! No! Get out of here! Amen. And amen. And amen. You have to forgive me. I\\'m not familiar with the local custom. Where i come from, You always say amen after you hear a prayer. Because that\\'s what you just heard. A prayer. Where i come from That particular prayer is called The prayer for the dead. You just heard the prayer for the dead, My fellow stockholders, And you didn\\'t say amen. This company is dead. I didn\\'t kill it. Don\\'t blame me. It was dead when i got here. It\\'s too late for prayers. For even if the prayers were answered And a miracle occurred And the yen did this And the dollar did that And the infrastructure did the other thing, We\\'d still be dead. You know why? Fiber optics. New technologies. Obsolescence. We\\'re dead, all right. We\\'re just not broke. And do you know The surest way to go broke? Keep getting an increasing share Of a shrinking market. Down the tubes. Slow but sure. You know, At one time, there must have been Dozens of companies making buggy whips. And i\\'ll bet the last company around Was the one that made The best goddamn buggy whip you ever saw. Now, how would you have liked To have been a stockholder in that company? You invested in a business, And this business is dead. Let\\'s have the intelligence, Let\\'s have the decency To sign the death certificate, Collect the insurance, And invest in something with a future. \"Ahh, but we can\\'t,\" Goes the prayer. We can\\'t because we have a responsibility, A responsibility to our employees, To our community. What will happen to them? I got two words for that. Who cares? Care about them? Why?

       "   'HI removed, cleaned and corrected by Tronar My name is Diana Henriques. As an investigating reporter for the \"New York Times,\" I had been covering the Bernie Madoff scandal from the day it began. After months of requests and correspondence, I was finally able to sit down and interview Bernie Madoff on August th, 2010. Until today, his only visitor, apart from lawyers has been his wife. He has not answered any independent questions about his crime except when standing in a courtroom responding to a judge. On those occasions, he seemed stiff, almost rehearsed. But in our conversation, he seemed relaxed, unfailingly candid, earnest, and trustworthy. That is his talent and his curse. That is what enabled him to pull off the biggest Ponzi scheme on record. $ billion. Bernard L. Madoff inmate number 61727054. In overseas trading today, the Nikkei was down over 8% with Australia\\'s benchmark not far behind. The crisis shows no sign of ending as DOW futures are down this morning on Wall Street and Main Street continues to find itselfin the crosshairs of the largest meltdownShit. Since the Great Depression. Investors and banks are holding onto their cash until more certainty can be flushed into financial markets. Let\\'s go now to Bob Summers with a story on yet another city going under from the mortgage crisis. I\\'m in Fresno, California, where if you look around Just let me lead it off. It\\'s completely fucking crazy. We can\\'t back down on this one, Andy. We\\'re not gonna back down. We\\'re gonna hold firm. What, no good mornings, no hellos? Dad? What\\'s going on? You\\'re giving out  mil in bonuses? I am? In December? We\\'ve had a very strong year. The year\\'s not over. We don\\'t know where we\\'re gonna land. I wanna reward people. I want them to feel good about the work they\\'ve done here. There\\'s a reason that the bonuses go out in February, especially in this climate. You\\'re not hearing me. It\\'s important that people can take care of their families. Isn\\'t it better to play it safe? Hang on to any windfall just in case? I\\'m paying out the bonuses now. But that\\'s crazy. It doesn\\'t make any sense? Peter? Bernie, come on. This isn\\'t a fucking debate. I\\'m paying out the bonuses now. I\\'m taking care of everybody. Dad, are you all right? What\\'s going on with you? I\\'m okay. Okay, are you sure? Bernie, just tell them. Tell us what? What is it, Dad? What\\'s going on? What is it, Dad? I have to talk to you. You can. You know you can. I know. Fucking fish bowl here. Fucking fish bowl. Huh? Everybody can see everything in here. How come we never got fucking blinds? - Hello? Hello, Ruth? Hi? The boys and I are heading home. Why? I have to talk to you all. Oh, okay. - Yeah, we\\'ll be home soon? All right. Is it your health? No. Let\\'s go in the study downstairs. There\\'s no way to to say it. None of it is real. It\\'s all one big fucking lie? What is? The advisory. It\\'s a fraud. There are no investments. What are you talking about? Of course there are investments? I made them up? They\\'re on every statement.  I ma I made them up? I\\'ve seen the trades. They\\'re fake. It\\'s all fake. Basically, just a big Ponzi scheme. What\\'s a Ponzi scheme? I took money from some people. I gave it to others and I never .there\\'s nothing left. There\\'s supposed to be  billion. There\\'s absolutely nothing. It\\'s all gone. I spoke to Peter .I told him I\\'m gonna turn myself in next week. How could you do this?  I just couldn\\'t stop - Bullshit. It got bigger and bigger and it just wouldn\\'t stop. Bullshit.  I didn\\'t mean for it to get like this? No, no, no, no. You can\\'t do this. I\\'m your son. Dad. Dad, how could you do this? I\\'m gonna set you guys up. Yeah. It\\'s it\\'s all gonna be okay. There\\'s still a few hundred million left. I\\'m gonna I\\'m gonna make sure .that you guys are all taken care of, .the rest of the family, some loyal employees. It\\'s all gonna be good. I just need a week. Set us up with what? With stolen money? He\\'s a criminal. He\\'s gonna spend his life in jail. Dad, how could you do this? You\\'re not my father. I explained to them that it wasn\\'t malicious, .that when I started this problem .or this crime .that is was something that I thought I would be able to work my way out of. But that became impossible. The harder I tried, the deeper I dug myself into a hole. But it comes down to one thing. I refused to accept the fact, .could not accept the fact .that for once in my life I had failed. I couldn\\'t I couldn\\'t admit that failure. And what was that failure? Shortly thereafter, I .I think I went back to the office. Andy was there. I saw Andy. Did you two speak? He did mention that .that he, uh .he and Mark were consulting with a lawyer. Well, as it turned out, he went to see Martin London .much honored lawyer, retired. He\\'s Mark\\'s father-in-law? Yes. He\\'d invested a substantial amount of money with you, right? Well, more than some, less than others. Jesus fucking Christ.  million?  billion, with a \"B.\" Jesus fucking Christ. All right, I\\'m in Hartford. I\\'ll be there at 3: PM. You have to understand the money management business .was operating from a small office.  Yeah, the office is on a separate floor? The th floor.  It\\'s always seemed successful? A ton of clients, I think.  Hedge funds? I know he\\'d even turn people away sometimes.  But all the tradesYeah, the trades go through European counterparties. That\\'s why he has the London office. And then upstairs on the th floor is market making.  Which is where we work? These are not my immediate concerns. But if he plans to spend the week .distributing his ill-gotten gains .amongst his relatives, .employees, his friends, .then this is not over. This is a crime in progress. So what are you saying? We have to turn him in? You don\\'t turn him in. You\\'re an accomplice. Yeah? Okay, it\\'s all fine. Yep. Who is it? The FBI is here. I know why you\\'re here. Well, we\\'re here to find out .if there\\'s an innocent explanation. There is no innocent explanation. Is there someplace we can talk, privately? In there. He said he\\'d been operating a Ponzi scheme .since the s. He was so matter-of-fact about it. He wasn\\'t nervous, he wasn\\'t afraid. He was just very casual. Well, sir, he claims to have acted alone. Yes, sir. I\\'ll bring him in. Hi, it\\'s Ruth. Are the boys there? They\\'re not there. He won\\'t be coming in today. Sir, you\\'re gonna have to remove your belt, .your shoelaces, your tie, .and any jewelry. This? Yep. Credit card, cash, .anything in your pockets, sir. Turn around, please, sir. Hands behind your back. Palms together. Put that stuff away. And call Ike Sorkin. What happened on the night of December 9, 2008? My brother told me .that his investment advisory business .was a Ponzi scheme. And what was your reaction to hearing that Mr. Madoff .was operating a Ponzi scheme? Well, I was in total shock. In your first interview with the government, .you stated that you idolized your brother. Is that correct? Yes, and that\\'s correct. Why did you idolize your brother? Well, because he was brilliant. Everywhere you go, people talked about Bernie. He was a true pioneer. Everyone in the industry, .including the highest-ranking officials at the SEC, .believed that my brother was .one of the most honorable and successful traders .of our time. Nobody believed that more than I did. I revered him. I trusted him implicitly.  Sorkin? Ike, it\\'s Bernie. Uh, I\\'m down at FBI headquarters .handcuffed to a wall. Bernie, don\\'t say another word. We arrested him this morning. Was he okay? I put the cuffs on him myself. He went quietly as though he expected us. To be honest, .he looked relieved. You did the right thing, son. Turn to the right. Yeah, the FBI just processed him .and they transferred him over to Pearl Street. Yeah, we\\'re heading in right now. So you were making money off of the trades. There were no trades.  What do you mean there were no trades? I made them up.  Weren\\'t there statements? Every month, they were fake. Purchase dates, they were fake; Shares, they were fake; Options, they were fake; Returns, they were fake. So when was the last trade you executed?  years ago. Who else knew? I acted alone. When did he tell you he started this Ponzi scheme? He didn\\'t. And the entire time he was running it, you had no idea?  No, I didn\\'t. - And what was your role at the firm? I ran the firm\\'s NASDAQ desk in the late \\'s, .added the rest of the market-making desk in 2001, .and moved to the proprietary trading desk in . You\\'re not answering my question. What exactly is your role at the firm? I\\'m only in the office a few days a week. I\\'ve been building a separate business called Madoff Energy Sir, what is your exact title at BLM? Director of Proprietary Trading .and Codirector of Trading. And where did the money for these loans come from? The loans that allowed you to buy your loft in SOHO, .your house in Greenwich, your house in Nantucket. I assume from the money he made through investments. On the private advisory side?  Yes? On the th floor?  Yes? And you never asked what went on the th floor? Of course I did.  You did? Yes.  ButBut what? He would always say, \"You run your business and I\\'ll run my business.\" And you never thought .to follow up on those questions?  You don\\'t understandYou\\'re right, I don\\'t. I don\\'t understand .how you could work in the same office as your father .for  years and suspect nothing. Nothing? Who are some of your father\\'s clients? I\\'m not privy to all of them, .but, um, Jeffry Picower was a big one. Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz of the Mets. HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, .some family friends, Marty. But he wouldn\\'t talk about who or what he did for them. Our money was with him as well. So you were never suspicious of your father? Never? Do you not understand who he was? I think we\\'re all beginning to understand .exactly who your father is, Mr. Madoff. He wasn\\'t just my father. You know, he was fucking idolized. We\\'re talking about a man .who created the modern market as we know it. He created NASDAQ. He\\'s Chairman of NASDAQ. He\\'s Chairman of the National Securities Clearing Corporation, Chairman of the International Securities Clearing Corporation, Chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, .which was FINRA before FINRA fucking existed. Chairman of the SIA Trading Committee.  Okay, we understand your point, sirNo, I don\\'t think you do. Chairman of the National Business Conduct Committee.  Sir, we understand? Member of the SIA Federal Regulation Committee.  Sir, that\\'s enough? Chairman of the NASD Small Order Execution Committee. I mean, you\\'re asking me how I didn\\'t know. Well, I\\'m asking you. You\\'re the FBI, you\\'re the SEC. You investigated him before, .so I\\'m I\\'m asking you .how the fuck did you not know?! Sir, we are not the focus here. You are. You\\'re saying that you never stepped foot .on the th floor? No. And why not? Sleigh bells ring Are you listening In the lane Snow is glistening What happened on the morning of December th, 2008? Uh, I was in my office .and, uh, I got a telephone call. Who was on the phone? It was, uh, Bernie Madoff. What did Bernie Madoff say to you? Yeah? Frank, my brother, is in the office  What? with the FBI. What the fuck? How old were you when you first started working .for Bernie Madoff? I was  years old. In what capacity had you known him? Oh, well, he was my boss. What type of work had you done for him over the years? Uh, really anything he asked me to. Everything from, you know, running errands .to running his investment advisory department. Did you know why the FBI was at Peter Madoff\\'s office? Yes, I did. And what did that mean to you? Uh, it meant that I was going to jail. Why did you think you were going to jail? Because I was well aware of the nature of the operation. And what was the nature of the operation? It was a fraud .simply put. I always thought that Bernie .would be able to make it good, you know? He had money here, he had money there, he moved stuff around. There was always a lot of moving parts. Maybe I was lying to myself. I don\\'t know, but I I thought he I thought he could cover it. What the hell is this? Bernie\\'s been arrested for securities fraud. The SEC\\'s getting a court order .to seize control and shut us down. Without an investigation? What could they possibly know? Whatever Bernie told them. Sir, who was that gentleman? He\\'s uh, he works here.  Where? Uh, on the th floor. There\\'s a th floor? Annette, Bernie\\'s been arrested for securities fraud. The SEC and the FBI are upstairs right now. What? The hell does that mean? We need your keycard, ma\\'am. Come on, come on, come on. Please, please. Come on, come on, come on. Open it. FBI! Everyone stop what what you\\'re doing! FBI! I said stop what you\\'re doing right now. Move away from the computer! Sir, FBI. Do not touch that computer. I said move away from the computer! Hey, Dan, walk this group out. The advisory was a completely separate business, .a completely separate entity. Never the two should meet, ever, .and they didn\\'t. And I made it that way on purpose, obviously. What about your brother? Peter\\'s in trouble. Yes? Because he trusted you. He did what you told him to.  He did? And you told him to do things that exposed him .to this criminal liability he\\'s facing right now. How did you justify that, Bernie? How did you sleep with that? I guess the way I could sleep with it .is that I knew that Peter didn\\'t know anything .even though I had him do things .which he didn\\'t realize .could\\'ve implicated him in this .in this, um .crime. Bernie was always needling people. He would find your weak spot and he would poke at it. I mean, that was Bernie and he could be a real bastard. But not like this. I mean, not stealing people\\'s money. I mean, at first, I started thinking, \"My God, you know, did one of the grandchildren get kidnapped?\" \"Was the  million ransom money?\" What  million? The  million that Ruth came in .and withdrew from her Cohmad account .and transferred into her Wachovia account. I mean, I what do I know? I mean, I\\'m always watching crime stories, you know? I fall asleep every night to \"SVU.\" And you\\'re saying on December th, Ruth Madoff withdrew $ million from her Cohmad account .and transferred it to a personal account? Yes, but that is not unusual. I mean, think of it like having an ATM .in your, you know your living room. Except, you know, when things are going on, .you wonder. Mommy\\'s here! Don\\'t forget your ball. We\\'re gonna go to Connecticut for a few days. You know it might snow? No mention of his arrest yet.  It\\'s my mom? Don\\'t answer. You know what Flumenbaum said .no contact. Don\\'t screw around, Mark.  Hi, Mom? Hi, Mark. Honey, I\\'m, um I\\'m with your father .and in order to release him on bond .they need four signatures. It\\'s a $ million bond.  What? Ugh, I know. Can you believe? Anyway, can you get down here? Uh, I\\'ll text you the address. Mom, .do you understand what he\\'s done? No, honey, Mark, I know you\\'re angry, .but he\\'s your father. I\\'m not doing it. End of discussion. Mark. I\\'ll try Andy. What do you mean by misunderstanding? We couldn\\'t get your sons to sign. They wouldn\\'t sign? I\\'m sorry, Mr. Madoff. The boys wouldn\\'t sign the bond? I\\'m very sorry, sir. Who did you talk to them or did No. Your wife was on the phone with each of them. Their mother did and they didn\\'t they wouldn\\'t Um Well, there\\'s no money involved in it. So did they understand that? Yes. Hmm, I don\\'t know. Marc, it\\'s Daniel Horwitz. We couldn\\'t get the four signatures, .but I can get you Ruth .and, um, Peter Madoff\\'s. Okay, hold on. Will you submit to, um, home detention .with electronic monitoring and surveillance, .homes in Manhattan, Montauk, and Palm Beach will be pledged, .and yours and Ruth\\'s passports will be surrendered. Are those terms okay with you? Um, yeah. He says yes Great.  Okay. - \"The Journal\" just went online with the story. We have  minutes before the press descends on this place. Let\\'s do this. Mr. Madoff. It\\'s very strange and troubling news .out of Wall Street tonight. Former NASDAQ Stock Exchange chairman Bernard Madoff .out on $ million bond. This man with a stellar reputation .seems to have taken a whole lot .of very smart people to the cleaners. The man they trusted the most with their money, .a NASDAQ chairman  years ago, .is now confessing to authorities .he cheated them of billions of dollars. And there\\'s a bunch of big-time investors .wondering, how a guy named Madoff .made off with their money. What\\'s gonna happen, Bernie?  I don\\'t know? Are you gonna go to jail? Probably. For how long?  I don\\'t know, Ruth? For a long time or a little? I don\\'t know.  What? I don\\'t know. Are they gonna take the apartment away?  I don\\'t know? What about the houses? What about the boys and the grandkids?  Ruth. Ruth, enough? Look I just wanna know if I\\'m sorry if I have questions, Bernie. I\\'m sorry if I\\'m a little scared, okay? It\\'s just you always keep me in the dark. I keep you in the dark to protect you. Yeah, well, it doesn\\'t feel that way anymore. I just wanna know what\\'s going on. Please, Bernie, don\\'t keep me in the dark anymore. Just tell me. Tell me. Tell you what, Ruth? Just tell me, I don\\'t know .what you did. I met Ruth when she was 13. I was 16. A friend was having a party in his basement. Something had happened to the jukebox. It got knocked around when he was moving it, .so the only song it\\'d play was \"Sh-Boom\" over and over. She was this tiny, little blonde .with enormous blue eyes. Just gorgeous. Very funny, too. You remember that actress Goldie Hawn? I do very well? Yeah, that was Ruth. She\\'d wake up every morning without a care in the world. Very lively, very bubbly. Popular, too.  Were you popular? Oh, yeah. I mean, I was a lifeguard at the time. Best job I ever had. I mean, why just be some regular schnook on the beach .when you can be in a guard tower, .everyone looking up at you?  And you get paid? Did Ruth ever get jealous? For the rest of the summer, .she laid out right next to the the guard tower every day. Sometimes I\\'d whistle down at her .and she\\'d look up and call me a dog. But I liked having her there. It felt good. I mean, we\\'ve basically been together .every day since the night we met. It\\'s our st anniversary coming up. Mm. How do you think you were able to keep it all separate? For  years, I kept this secret from my wife, .my brother, .my sons. How I was able to do that .and maintain any degree of sanity, .well, it\\'s, uh .that worries me when I think about it. Oh, oh, yes I\\'m the great pretender Ooh, ooh Pretending that I\\'m doing well Ooh, ooh My need is such I pretend too much  Those are fresh? Yes, sir. They are really fresh?  Fresh this morning? Not freshly frozen?  No, sir? Fresh, fresh, okay. I\\'m the great pretender Check all the plates. Make sure that none of them are dirty, please. I don\\'t want anybody coming here and eating on a dirty plate. They pick up a napkin, .you pick up a napkin .and then you have dirt under here like this. This one. See? Dirty plate. Make sure they\\'re all clean. What was your job title .at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities? Chief compliance officer. I never had any financial interest in the firm. Bernie made it clear that there was no prospect for partnership. Boom, ba-doh ba-doo, ba-doodle-ay Oh, life could be a dream If I could take you up in paradise up above If you would tell me Eleanor. So who\\'s the more handsome brother, him or me? All right, we\\'ve all heard this one, Casanova.  Come on? In my opinion? Be honest.  Peter\\'s way more attractive? Oh. So you\\'ve got a thing for barrel-chested bald men with big stomachs? Screw you! In fact, Bernie, .when I first met Peter, I said to myself, \"My God, this man looks just like Lee Majors.\"  Handsome? Thank you, Eleanor. Yeah, that was  years ago. Back then, even you were attractive, Eleanor. Stuff it, Bernie. You know you got a thing for me. Do not lie. You\\'re right, I do.  Come here? You know I love you. I gotta make the rounds. Peter, do not let him get to you, that one. I\\'m used to it, believe me. Sh-boom, sh-boom Ya, da, da, da da, da, da, da, da, da Sh-boom, sh-boom Ya, da, da, da da, da, da, da, da, da Sh-boom Sh-boom, sh-boom The fuck you looking at? Annette, you have a fucking heart attack, I\\'m not giving you mouth-to-mouth. Ya, da, da, da da, da, da, da, da, da Just so we\\'re clear. Ya, da, da, da, da, da da, da, da, da, sh-boom. Behind you is not the place to be. Your accounts at Madoff Securities .had a total of approximately $ million.  Is that correct? Yeah, that\\'s correct. Did it strike you as absurd .that someone with just a high school education .should have that kind of money? No! I was very, very lucky. Kind of like winning the lottery? Kind of like winning the lottery. Did it occur to you .because you had this great account .and it was worth so much, .there must be something fraudulent there? No. I never thought of the word fraudulent. In my experience, .and I mean this, there\\'s only four different types of pussy. Okay? I\\'m dead serious. You got your let me show you. I just saw one. All right, right there. See there? That\\'s your Honda Civic pussy. Gets you where you wanna go. No shame in this pussy at all. Reliable.

Right there. You see that there? That\\'s your Buick Regal pussy. Okay, a step up from the Honda. Uh, generally they\\'re cleaner, okay? Roomier, you fit more passengers in there. I guess there\\'s pros and cons to that in a pussy. You know, lovely pussy. Nobody\\'s gonna mistake it for a Benz, though. Am I right? Am I right, Robert? Okay, thank you. God bless you. I just want you to know, .despite everything you see, Andrew is not from money.  Oh, no, no? He\\'s not from money. I I\\'m not I\\'m not I know you might think he\\'s a rich guy, .but he\\'s not. We\\'re from nothing. My father was broke. We\\'re not rich people. We\\'re humble people.  Okay? You understand? Yes.  Come here? Yeah. Oh. Oh! I\\'m gonna have to get out the hose .and spray him. Next up, my personal favorite. I just saw one. There. Now, don\\'t make it obvious. Right there. That is your Lincoln Continental pussy. Beautiful. Just it\\'s just right. You know what I mean? Like Goldilocks just right. It\\'s not too fancy, it\\'s not too plain. It just it\\'s just comfortable. It just it just fits. No, no, it\\'s like an old pair of slippers .except instead of your foot, you put your cock in it.  Am I wrong? You have a daughter, right? Yeah, Sophie. She\\'s wonderful. I can\\'t wait for you to meet her. And who\\'s the father again? Um, uh, John, .my my ex-partner at Urban Angler. And you two never married? Um, no. No. If I had had a baby out of wedlock, .my father would have taken me out back and shot me. I\\'m not kidding, he would\\'ve shot me. No, no, stay with me .and hold all questions till the end.  Okay? Right there, you see that? Ugh. There it read it and weep. It\\'s your Mercedes-Benz pussy. Right? Look at it. I mean, it\\'s beautiful. It\\'s just a feat of vaginal engineering. No, it handles just great. It\\'s sleek, it\\'s tight, .it looks good, it feels good, it smells good. But a lot of upkeep. Yeah? Payments are murder and you gotta wax it, you gotta polish it, .you gotta talk to it, ou gotta listen to it, eh? And, most importantly, .you gotta remain ever vigilant .that nobody fucking jacks it, right? You don\\'t have to worry about that 2\\'cause you\\'ll never get near anything like that. So don\\'t worry about it. Is it fair to say .that as a result of all of these lies, .you got rich? Well, I didn\\'t get paid per lie, ma\\'am. As a product of the fraud that was Madoff Securities, .you got rich, correct? Yeah, that\\'s correct, yeah. You built, as you described, .a lavish home in Bridgewater, New Jersey, correct?  Well, define \"lavish.\"Sure.  Uh, how many bedrooms did it have? Five.  How many bathrooms? Seven.  How many acres? Seven.  Did it have a swimming pool? Yes, it did.  Did it have a tennis court?

With all due respect, Frank\\'s Frank\\'s what? Frank\\'s an idiot. You know, Frank never went to college. I heard Frank, comparing women\\'s vaginas to automobiles .earlier today. Whether Frank is refined enough for your taste is irrelevant. He\\'s good at his job. If something were to happen to me, .he\\'d fill you guys in on all the details you need to know. And what if Frank decides to screw you? I mean, I don\\'t even know how much you\\'re worth. Is it a billion? Two billion? Three? What if there\\'s three and he says there\\'s two .and takes a billion and rides off into the sunset? Calm down, calm down. Everything is written down in a safe deposit box. If something were to happen to me, .you consult with our lawyers, and they\\'ll handle it. They\\'ll fill you in on everything. Everything, huh?  That\\'s right, everything? Everything? You know, good luck. This conversation is impossible.  I don\\'t understand why you can\\'t understandImpossible! What I just said to you. You know, why is it that whenever this conversation comes up, .you find a way to wriggle out of giving me an answer? It comes up because you bring it up. No, because I\\'m we\\'re trying to plan. Well, if you don\\'t bring it up, it won\\'t come up. You know, I\\'m just trying to get a a basic sense You don\\'t have to get a sense of anything, Mark.  You don\\'t have to get a sense of anything? Why is that too much to ask?  I\\'ve told you this is something I don\\'t talk about? Dad. Dad! Listen to me.  I don\\'t understand!Listen, what is wrong? Are you a fucking idiot? Are you a fucking idiot?! I mean, answer me!  I don\\'t understand!No, you don\\'t understand! You don\\'t have to fucking understand! You\\'re asking me about taking over the advisory .and yet you can\\'t even follow a simple fucking instruction .to shut the fuck up! You don\\'t understand. You don\\'t understand. Leave it alone. Okay. I\\'m sorry.  Good night? I love you, Dad. Love you. Good night. Hey, nonny, ding, dong a-lang, a-lang, a-lang Boom, ba-doh ba-doo, ba-doodle-ay Oh, life could be a dream If I could take you up in paradise up above If you would tell me I\\'m the only one that you love Life could be a dream sweetheart Hello, hello, again, sh-boom and hopin\\' we\\'ll meet again Oh, life could be a dream Sh-boom If only all my precious plans would come true People here always ask me how come I never ran. But the truth is it didn\\'t even occur to me. I guess it\\'s because I never thought .of what I was doing was stealing. Well, it was a $ billion Ponzi scheme. People lost their life savings, they lost their homes. Their lives were destroyed. You didn\\'t think of that as stealing? People felt safe with you.  Yeah, but these wereAnd yet .you were betraying them all. Well, but these people, you know, .they had a little greed in them, too. There was a little bit of, you know .look, you know, and they didn\\'t wanna look too hard. They looked just far enough.  So they\\'re accomplices in some way, too? Bernie. Accomplices because they trusted you? Accomplices because you were so trustworthy, .you seemed so trustworthy. Yeah, but there\\'s a lack of honesty on their behalf, .an unwillingness to take responsibility for their behavior.  Your investors? Yes. It takes a lot of chutzpah .for you of all people to say that. You know .now that I think of it, .my greatest failure .or maybe it\\'s my greatest weakness .is I\\'ve always wanted to please people. And that\\'s .that\\'s one that can get you into trouble. I\\'ve been here all fucking morning!  I wanna go upstairs? Sir, nobody\\'s going upstairs right now. I wanna see somebody in charge. Right now, I\\'m in charge? Who are you protecting?! And you need to back up right now.  We\\'re talking about my fucking life savings!I told you right now!  Do you understand? You need to back up right now, sir. Hello, Madoff? I\\'m in the fucking lobby. I wanna come up. Sir, I am not able .to give you permission to come up here right now. Where is my fucking money?! You have to call the advisory arm.  I can give you their number? Fuck you, you fucking thief! Oh, my God. Unusual circumstances did not exist for Bernie. Take 11. When those towers got hit, .everybody in the whole entire office .was gathered around the TV. Who was crying? Who was hysterical? Not Bernie. He kept his head down and he continued to work. And it is not like .he did not know anybody .in those buildings. As with every event .of personal devastation, .they remember exactly where they were .and what they were doing .when they learned they were ruined. The grayish white paper .rolled out of Mary Thomajan\\'s fax machine. The fax was from the small feeder fund .she had trusted for  years .telling her that all her money .had been invested with Madoff, .who had been arrested. She later recalled, \"In the  seconds it took to read that fax,\" \"I went from being a multi-millionaire\" \"to having my life savings wiped out\" \"and life as I knew it altered forever.\" Robert Halio\\'s son called him at his retirement home .in Boca Raton with the news. It\\'s all gone, Dad. I don\\'t I don\\'t know what to do. 595% of his wealth .had been entrusted to Madoff and was now gone. Mr. De la Villehuchet .had written his brother a letter that said, \"If you ruin your friends, your clients,\" \"you have to face the consequences.\" He then positioned a trash basket .to protect the carpet .and slit his wrist with a box cutter. Tim Murray, a property manager in Minnesota, .was traveling and nearly drove off the road Fort Lauderdale Richard FreedmanDavid Iselin Time to pay the piper, Bernie. Presumably .presumably with the life savings of another piper. Just This was the worst pyramid scheme .since the actual pyramids.  Ruth loves to go to the California Pizza Kitchen. - Yeah. And they say that her favorite dish there .is the veal Scallo-Ponzi. Listen, I have something to tell you that\\'s really important. I have your money! I can get it to you. Okay, I guess you\\'re not there. They can see right in.  They can see right in? What? We we don\\'t have any curtains. They can see right in. Hold on, let me call you back.  Catherine, it\\'s gonna be fine? No, they\\'re gonna be looking in .with their long lenses and we\\'ll be trapped. They\\'re gonna get bored just standing around. I\\'m not the story. We\\'ve gotta get curtains right now. Shit. Hi, how are you? I\\'m all right. You? I\\'ve been better. I\\'ll bet.  Mommy, Mommy? What?  Is that Ruth Madoff? Jessica, not another word. It\\'s okay. No, none of it is. There she is.  Hi, Sarah? Oh, hi. Is Gisele here? I was wondering .if she might be able to fit me in today. I haven\\'t had my hair colored in God knows how long.  Um, I think she\\'sYou know, don\\'t worry.  I\\'ll find her? Uh I\\'ve been coming here for  years, Pierre. I understand. We have too many clients .who have lost their money because of your husband. But I don\\'t trust anyone else. I\\'m very sorry, .but I can\\'t afford to risk my reputation. What about a house call? I can pay extra.  I\\'m sorryPierre. .but I have to ask you to leave now. I\\'m sorry, Ruth.  Shit. - Ruth!  What are you doing? Nothing! What are you doing?  Looking for something? My lighter. Well, aren\\'t there matches in the drawer?  No? No? What do you mean?  There\\'s always matches in the drawer? Well, we\\'re out. Where\\'d you last see it? If I knew where I last saw it, I wouldn\\'t be looking for it, Bernie. I\\'m such an idiot. How did I get to be this age .without doing anything on my own? What are you talking about? I I didn\\'t do anything, Bernie. I never did one thing on my own. I I don\\'t have a career, I don\\'t have a name, I don\\'t I don\\'t have any friends of my own. The only thing I have are regrets. That\\'s all I got to show for myself.  Regret after regret? Ruth, do we have to go into this now? I got a lot on my mind. I\\'m going away and who knows if I\\'m going to come back.  Why would you say that? I\\'m not saying for certain  No, Ike said that you\\'d be able toForget I mentioned it. You can\\'t do that. I\\'m not ready. I I\\'m, I\\'m not ready to be alone. You\\'re all I have. The boys don\\'t speak to me. No one speaks to me. I\\'ll I\\'ll go crazy, Bernie. I\\'ll I\\'ll go crazy all alone. I\\'ll go crazy, Bernie, I will. Hi. Leave a message after the tone. Bernie! Bernie, you there? Bernie? Come on, pick up. I know you\\'re hiding that  billion somewhere, .you piece-of-shit cocksucker. I hope you enjoy getting your ass raped every night, 05\\'cause you\\'re going away for a long time. Hasta la vista, you kike motherfucker. What are you doing? I can\\'t live like this. Slogging through, .being miserable to no good end. What\\'s the point? You know, I was thinking earlier .this this isn\\'t even about me. This country needs a villain, .someone to send to the gallows .so everyone can feel okay about living under a rigged system. I don\\'t give a rat\\'s ass, Bernie. Well, it\\'ll be better once I go. What\\'s with the jewelry? It\\'s the only thing the court didn\\'t freeze. I\\'m gonna wrap it all up, .give it to family, .and then kill myself. Why would you kill yourself? Because I\\'m tired of being hated. I don\\'t even understand it. I you got yourself into trouble. You couldn\\'t get out. What do I have to do with it? Why does the world hate me? They all think I\\'m some kind of a mastermind. Take it as a compliment, Ruth. They say all these horrible things about me. They say I I was your bookkeeper.  They sayYou weren\\'t my bookkeeper. I did maintain the records the first year. That was in 1960. It was just you and me. I mean, but you weren\\'t even a real bookkeeper. No, but I\\'m just saying don\\'t make it seem like I didn\\'t pitch in .because I even came back, remember?  Yeah, but then we hired a real bookkeeper? And I helped with payroll.  We hired a real bookkeeper? Right, so why are they making it seem .like I like, I\\'m involved with all this stuff? Because they\\'re out for blood, honey. That\\'s why. They just wanna But anybody in the know knows you weren\\'t the mastermind.  That\\'s nonsense? Oh, well, thanks. I already wanna kill myself. Are you trying to make me feel worse? No, but I You, uh .you\\'d commit suicide? With what? I don\\'t know. I haven\\'t figured that part out yet. Something nice. Maybe Ambien. How much Ambien do we have? Enough to open a fucking pharmacy. What about these? Klonopin? Same thing. Just put it in here. Do have yourself a merry little Christmas. It\\'s a great song and you\\'ll be hearing Judy Garland sing it Can\\'t we just have quiet? I can\\'t fall asleep unless I watch something. You just took a whole fucking bottle .of Ambien, Bernie. Sleep\\'s not gonna be your problem. My mind races. Fine. Our last night on Earth .will be you, me, and Judy Garland.  How romantic? Let\\'s not get started, Ruth. We had a good life, didn\\'t we? Yeah, .until you ruined it. Have yourself A merry little Christmas Let your heart be light Next year all our troubles Will be out of sight Have yourself Pop-pop! Pop-pop! Make the yuletide gay Next year all our troubles Will be miles away Once again Hello? As in olden days Poppop! Hello? Happy golden days Of yore Faithful friends Mark, Andy. Uh, I\\'m glad you came. I have so much I wanna tell you. So much I wanna tell you. I never I never wanted any I never wanted either of you .to to .to, you know I just never wanted either of you to .it just .sometimes things in life happen .that you don\\'t even You know, there\\'s a lot that I never really wanted to .to tell you. Uh, I\\'m glad I\\'m glad you\\'re here. Once again As in olden days Happy golden Good evening. It is a day that will be in bold print .in history books. Black Monday, October th, 1987, .when the stock market went into a free fall, .losing more in one day .than it did on Black Tuesday in 1929. Fucking rigged. How to fuck the little guy. I wonder if I can count on you. Of course. Pop-pop! Can I count on you? Pop-pop! We took a big hit today. Lost over a billion and change. You know how with a split-strike conversion strategy .the stock options offset losses? It\\'s like insurance. A fucking meltdown like this, would have been a nice strategy. If only we had it in place  before the fuckingNo ifs. No ifs. And we tell no one. We tell no one. Pop-pop! Basically, we\\'re picking winners of yesterday\\'s horse races? Yeah, so if anyone double-checks our trades, we got it all there.  All winners? Fine. Make sure the books show .that the London office is clearing the trades .so no one upstairs in market-making is involved. Not my brother, not the boys, no one.  Understand? Yeah, of course, of course, yeah. No one. Erwin\\'s last words to me, .the last thing he said was, \"Bernie will take care of everything.\" He\\'s gone, and I don\\'t know what to do. It\\'s gonna be okay. You can take all of Erwin\\'s other accounts .his savings, life insurance, everything .and you can put it all in his account here. God bless you, Bernie. Pop-pop!  Pop-pop!Daniel!  Pop-pop? Yeah? Are you gonna die in jail? Somehow Ruth. Ruth. Ruth, I need more pills. Ruth. Have you no shame? Hello? Have you no shame? No remorse? Have you no conscience? You steal from widows, .you steal from charities, .you steal from Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor. You prey on your own people. You steal from your own people. Have you no shame!?  Huh? Well, we\\'re still here. Mr. Markopolos, it\\'s all yours. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My team and I tried our best to get the SEC to investigate .and shut down the Madoff Ponzi scheme .with repeated and credible warnings to the SEC .that started in May 2000.  We knew thatRuth. What? You wanna watch this Harry guy\\'s testimony? Who? Harry I don\\'t know, I can\\'t pronounce it. What\\'s he testifying about? Me. Over a nine-year time span. If a $ billion Ponzi scheme .doesn\\'t make the SEC\\'s priority list, .then I wanna know who sets their priorities. What made you think that Bernie Madoff was a fraud? The key tip-off and it took me about five minutes .to figure out that he was a fraud .I\\'m gonna give you a hand signal and I\\'m gonna show you .what his performance return line looked like. It went in only one direction up. It never had variation like the market does .like like this, but then I did  Who is this guy? He tried to warn the SEC about me.  And what happened? They ignored his warnings.  So what\\'s the point? What do mean what\\'s the point? Well, what\\'s the point of all this? Well, he\\'s saying that basically, .he handed the SEC the evidence .and they didn\\'t follow up on it. Oh, so a government agency is incompetent.  Mm-hmm? Yeah, and that\\'s news? No, look, I\\'ve been saying that for years. And I have firsthand knowledge. This fucking cocksucker walks in and out of the building .with this jacket on. What the fuck is wrong with him? Bern, the guy\\'s asking for our DTC account number. What are we gonna do? I mean, all my years dealing with the SEC, I\\'ve never seen this enforcement. Who the fuck does this guy think he is? Boss, if we don\\'t give the guy the number, .it\\'s gonna be obvious that we\\'re hiding something. Yeah, but the way he just fucking walks in here like that, .no fucking suit or nothing.  No, I know? What kind of fucking arrogance? The jacket\\'s annoying, but, Bern, please focus. If we do give it to him, .uh, one call to the DTC and that\\'s it. Game over. We\\'re just here for a routine exam. We haven\\'t done one in  years.  You were just here? Uh, we we weren\\'t.  DC Inspections was? We don\\'t talk to DC. So, uh, tell me about this article. Yeah, I was very bothered by this. I mean, why would they make me look fat? Excuse me? I mean, look at my face. Look at my cheeks. I look like a fucking porpoise. Well, um, yes, but I\\'m referring to the allegations. What about it? Lori Richards has all this information. I sent it to her in a file. They have it. As I told you, we\\'re a very large organization.  We don\\'t talk to each other? You don\\'t talk to DC? N-no. It it\\'s, uh This is the problem with the SEC. I\\'ve been saying this for years. I mean, you have to have better communication. How are you supposed to be able to do your job .with a fraction of the information? Well, we\\'re trying to get all of the information. Well, don\\'t you think you should start by talking to DC? I mean, I got my whole office here .is wondering what\\'s happening. You come in with that jacket, .it embarrasses the hell out of all of us. And this? It\\'s a fucking cartoon. It\\'s an old article. It\\'s four years old. And you\\'re asking me questions about an old article .with a silly cartoon? And you haven\\'t spoken to DC. Are we, um are we waiting on your lawyers? I never have lawyers in the office .when I\\'m talking to regulators for two reasons. One, I\\'m not doing anything wrong. Two, I know the rules better than most .because I drafted a majority of them. And we haven\\'t met before, .but we have very strong relationships. And I was on the short list for SEC director. Yes, we we know that. If you need anything at all, I\\'ll be in my office. There\\'s no such thing as an inconvenience.  Thanks? I\\'m here. Oh, um, .by the way, are these securities with the DTC?  Of course? We\\'re gonna need your account number .just so we can verify the assets. Oh, Bern, you\\'re fucking killing me. 32646. 32646. Great, thank you. Do you mind if you take that jacket off .before you go out there?  Oh, umJust Sure. One call. All the SEC had to do was make one call .and they would\\'ve seen that everything was fake, .that there was nothing there. But they never called. You just gambled that they wouldn\\'t call? It was more than a gamble. It was .it was a leap of faith, if you will. You wait, knowing what they will find .if they make that call. I can\\'t imagine what that was like. It was it was excruciatingly difficult. At some point, you figured I figured that they didn\\'t do it. They just didn\\'t follow up on it. If you didn\\'t plan on killing yourself .or going into hiding, .how did you think it would end? Well, it was almost like, uh .it sounds horrible to say it now .but I just wanted the whole world to come to an end. When  happened, I thought this was the only way out. The world would come to an end, I\\'d be dead, .and everybody would be gone. But, I mean, I could\\'ve kept it going. I could\\'ve covered everything. Even after the fall of \\'08, I had enough commitments of cash that would\\'ve come in. So I could\\'ve, you know I I I just got tired. I knew by Thanksgiving I was gonna give it up. I was gonna stop. Financial turmoil in the US. Wall Street in crisis mode. Wall Street on red alert. Bear Stearns has effectively gone under. The largest bankruptcy in US history.  Unprecedented? This is really shaking the foundation of Wall Street. A lot of money and a lot of jobs. America\\'s economy is facing unprecedented challenges. All of this taking a devastating toll on stocks. Single biggest point drop ever. I\\'m sorry to bother you. I just got another call you\\'re gonna fucking love.  Yeah, go ahead? Bank Medici\\'s .pulling out  million, Bern. Stanley Chais has been draining us all goddamn year, .and this is on top of Fairfield\\'s withdrawals. I delivered for these fucking people for fucking decades .and now they\\'re all running for the fucking hills. Bern, we can\\'t keep getting hit with these redemptions. We gotta find a way to conserve. I think we should lower the returns. Are you kidding? That\\'ll cause a bigger panic. They\\'ll all pull out, the greedy fucks. We can\\'t do that. Well, we gotta do something. We\\'re treading water like a fucking paraplegic here. I was just sayingHold on, let me get rid of this idiot. The joke on the street is that Bernie\\'s like the Jewish T-bill.  Very funny. I\\'m on the phone. I\\'m on the phone? He\\'s that safe. I\\'m on the phone. I\\'ll introduce you guys later. He\\'s gonna love you. See if you can rattle Fairfield\\'s cage. In the meantime, I\\'ve got a few ideas.  Fairfield? Yeah. All right. Uh-huh. Nice, nice? Not in a bathing suit. Me neither.  Hey? Hey, kid. I heard you\\'re the one who hustled .those penny stocks in that shitty office you had downtown. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that\\'s me. Can you believe I\\'ve known this man for  years? Carl, listen, I wanna tell you something. Not now. There are some real opportunities in the market right now .and I wanna make you aware of them.  Not now, Bernie? I know, I know.  Not now? I know. I wouldn\\'t tell you about them .unless they were really, really important, okay? I don\\'t want you mad at me you missed out. All right. How much do you want me to put in? 41250.  On top of the  million I already have with you? Yes. The market in shambles? It\\'s plummeting, but now is the time to take advantage.  I\\'m so exposedThat\\'s exactly why I\\'m proposing this to you. I\\'m afraid I\\'ll be arrested for public indecency. Oh, I\\'m not doing it with everybody.  It\\'s just a few people? All right, all right. Enough.  Okay, and you are family? I\\'ll tell you. Listen, I\\'ll think about it.  Okay? Okay? But don\\'t take too long. In all seriousness, don\\'t take too long. Please don\\'t take too long.  CarlI said it. I will think about it.  Period? I live you, I respect that. Thank you very much. Fucking rich people. Parasites. You\\'re in a mood. I gotta take this. Well, I just got off the phone .with that cocksucker at Kingate. He\\'s pulling out  million. Do these fucking people not understand .how a fucking split-strike works?  Do they not understand? Hold on, I got Fairfield calling me back. Hold on. Yeah? Hey, Rick Jarvis. We met at the club a few months back with Solomon. Well, look, while I got your attention, I just exited this private equity venture with a five X return. I\\'m looking to put that money to work right away this quarter. Well, unfortunately, that\\'s not possible. I haven\\'t told you how much.  Well, it really doesn\\'t matter.$ million. I\\'m sorry, but the fund .is fully subscribed for the quarter.  Even in this market? My clients know not to worry. I know how to avoid the pitfalls. Okay, I want in this quarter, all right? Whatever restrictions you wanna put on it, .you know, I\\'ll park this money with you for a long time. It\\'s not about the money. It\\'s about pushing clients aside. I can\\'t do that. I have to sacrifice someone, .a loyal client to me, in order to accommodate you. Unless it\\'s really, really worth it I am talking about giving you  million. That\\'s, uh, not gonna do it. So what\\'s it gonna take? I have to do what\\'s ethical.  I can\\'t let you jump the line? I\\'ll go  if you let me.  Love to help you, but I can\\'t.175. Fully subscribed.  200.I wish I could. I\\'m just thinking if I no. 47225? 47250. 47275.  million. How far do we gotta go? Just tell me. If you go above four, we might have something. 48400. I can do that. We got a deal. I gotta take this phone call. Yeah? I don\\'t know who the fuck I was just talking with, .but if this guy checks out, we just picked up a good piece of change. Well, the shit is definitely hitting the fucking fan. I got Fairfield-Greenwich on the line.  You want me to patch you in? Go ahead. Hey, Bernie. We catching you at a bad time? You tell me. I got a back spasm that\\'s fucking killing me. Bernie. Bernie? What\\'s going on?  Can I just get one minute? Not Just one minute to introduce you.  I can\\'t talk? Just one minute!  Yeah? - Look, Bern, .you\\'re basically the only fund that hasn\\'t gotten hammered. You\\'re the one place clients can turn to for liquidity .without taking huge losses. It\\'s the winner\\'s curse. What what, am I supposed to be flattered .that you just cashed out a billion and a half dollars? You gotta put a stop to these redemptions .because if you don\\'t, just know there\\'s plenty of money out there .that would love to take your place.  Is that a threat? You can take it any way you like. Look at you all dressed up and no place to die.  Hello, Jeffry? Come on, Bernie, there\\'s no need for stress. I haven\\'t made many withdrawals. Although, that\\'s probably something we should discuss, hmm? I did wanna tell you that there are some real opportunities .in the market right now if you\\'re interested, Jeffry.  Hmm? What do you think?  We should be talkingMrs. Madoff!  Mr. Picower? Your husband doesn\\'t look well. You should attend to him, hmm? You okay? What\\'s wrong with him, Picower? He\\'s one strange, sicko fuck. Oh, by the way, my sister, .she\\'s worried about the economy .and she was thinking about investing .the rest of her savings with you.  Would that be okay? Yeah, sure. Walter, I\\'m not a fucking money market fund, do you understand? If you don\\'t stop these withdrawals .and replace the money before the end of the month, .then I\\'m gonna cut you off! I\\'m gonna close the whole fucking Fairfield account! Yes! Do you hear me?! Oh, shit. What the? I hated that. No, I didn\\'t!You loved it.  You came out of there, you said don\\'t lie? Oh, I did not!  You\\'re such a liar? You\\'re a liar. Sweetheart, is that a little bit too rare? This is good.  Everything all right? - Yeah. Did you wheel your luggage into the bedroom?  Why? Did you wheel your luggage into the bedroom? Well, I certainly didn\\'t bring it in through the window. But you smudged the wall by the door. You scuffed it with your roller bag. Well, string me up and feed me to the dogs. I\\'m sorry I scuffed a wall, Bernie. Emily, was just asking about Wall Street, Dad. Yeah, .how is Wall Street, Papa? She\\'s working on her MBA. Dad, future head of Madoff Securities. That\\'s right. Watch out, guys. I asked how\\'s Wall Street, Papa? Wall Street is good. Dad says things are bad at Wall Street. Well, Dad told you that, but things are fine. Why are they bad? What did I just say? I asked a question. Why is it bad? I told you they\\'re not bad. Why don\\'t you just eat? Well, if it\\'s not bad, why do they call it a meltdown?  Why don\\'t you tell me? How am I supposed to know?  That\\'s why I\\'m asking you? Do you read \"Barron\\'s,\" huh? Do you read the \"Wall Street Journal\"?  Why don\\'t you tell me? I just asked a question. You are my granddaughter and you\\'re an eight-year-old .and you shouldn\\'t be asking me questions like that.  I don\\'t feel like talking about Wall Street. - Hey, Dad.  I don\\'t feel like be talking about Wall Street? Dad.  I\\'m here having dinner with my family? That\\'s enough. Bernie, what\\'s wrong with you? She\\'s just curious. Because she doesn\\'t know what the hell she\\'s talking about. She\\'s eight years old. I gotta get grilled by this kid.  Why are you being so mean? I got so many other goddamn things I\\'m worried about on Wall Street .and this kid\\'s asking me about how Wall Street is!  Shut up and eat your food! - Dad! It\\'s okay, sweetheart. Bernie, stop it! What\\'s wrong with you? Now you\\'re playing the good guy.  Honey, it\\'s okay, it\\'s okay? Taking her side.  She\\'s just curious? Now I can\\'t eat.  It\\'s okay, it\\'s okay? She\\'s an eight-year-old kid. What\\'s the matter with you? You\\'re just too smart. It\\'s okay. I wanna know why you\\'re acting this way. The fucking market is a bloodbath.  Ah! God damn it? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it ea Dad. Fucking thing. What\\'s going on? Are you all right? I started these blood pressure pills. Makes me dizzy.  Maybe you should take a couple days off? No, I can\\'t. I have to be at the office first thing in the morning.  Founder of Home Depot? Reschedule.  You knowThis fucking thing. If you ever trusted me .to help you with the advisory, .you know, I could handle this kind of thing for you. It\\'s my business, not yours. Well, what happens when you\\'re gone?  I\\'m not having this discussion with you? It\\'s a legitimate question.  I\\'m not having this discussion with you? What is it, Dad? Tell me. What is it? Is it that I\\'m not cut out?  Are you not listening? Just be honest with me.  Just tell me? Do you not see what I have to deal with, .the shit that I have to go through on a daily basis? No, that\\'s why that\\'s my point. The fucking shit that they put me through? That they\\'re trying to fuck me all the time? Steal from me? Do you think you can do that? Do you think you can deal with that?  Yes, I can? I don\\'t think you can deal with it. Bullshit. I don\\'t think so. You can\\'t stomach that stuff. That\\'s not in you. Andy, maybe, but not you. What? Wait, what are you saying? Are you saying that Andy .what are you saying? Andy\\'s better at his job than I am?  Mark? I go to that fucking office every single day. I do the same thing that he does. I gave you a fucking business to run. Are you not happy with that? Was that not good enough for you? It is definitely good enough for me, Dad.  I\\'m just tryingWell, then shut the fuck up .and give me a little fucking gratitude. Say, \"I\\'m thanks, Dad.\" Can\\'t you do that? What, do you think the whole fucking world owes you something? The whole fucking world owes you nothing. You gotta work for it, and I always say this with your mother. This is the problem with having money, an education. Nothing is earned. You want something, you gotta fucking work for it. What, you don\\'t think I have? For you, it was installing sprinklers. For me, it was digging ditches on a construction crew. I never would have started Home Depot if I hadn\\'t had that experience. Ken, I wanna be respectful of your time, .so I\\'m gonna get right to it. I\\'m starting a new highly exclusive fund. It\\'s gonna have just five investors. Same split-strike conversion strategy .that\\'s performed so consistently. But, frankly, .this fund\\'s gonna have even higher returns. The only thing is that it relies .on the market volatility that we\\'re seeing now, .so I gotta put the money together right away. Your current fund\\'s been running for a while, hasn\\'t it? It has. Decades. Double digit returns every year. And you\\'re promising even better returns for the new fund? It\\'s a unique opportunity, Ken. Uh-huh. So I\\'m asking myself only one question. What if I\\'m a longtime client of yours .and, uh, how would I feel .getting shafted for new customers? There are other people that I do other funds with, .but I don\\'t wanna include them in this because they\\'re not  Whoa, whoa, wait a second? they\\'re not the ones Okay, just a second. I\\'m a little confused. You got this fund, you got that fund, .you got people who are long-term customers and you\\'re not gonna Those people are already taken care of. We have we have other funds with them. Bernie, I don\\'t I don\\'t know what you\\'re trying to say.  WellI\\'m confused. The new fund is getting money before the other people?  That\\'s not what I\\'m saying? That\\'s exactly what you\\'re saying. I\\'m not saying that. They are taken care of. I have other arrangements with them. Something is not kosher here.  Something? No, it\\'s all kosher. I think it\\'s not kosher. I think it\\'s total bullshit. That\\'s what I think. It\\'s hitting me the wrong way. Something is wrong here. I think you\\'re full of shit, that\\'s what I think. I\\'m getting the hell out of here. Is that guy in? You\\'re kidding me. All right, well, uh, between Medici, Kingate, .and the fucking Spaniards, .that\\'s minus 1. billion right there. Thanks to Fairfield, we\\'re down  in November .and we\\'re looking at at least minus  in December, Bern. We write that fucking check, it\\'s gonna bounce. We got  million left. What do you wanna do? Hey, Carl, this is great news. I just want you to know it\\'s great news.  All right, take care? Okay, of course, of course.  Great. Okay, talk soon? That\\'s it.  Thank you? Okay. He\\'s in for 250. All right. That\\'s not nothin\\'. No, but it\\'s not enough. No, it\\'s definitely not enough. What about that schmuck from Palm Beach? Oh, no, no, no, it was, like,  fucking questions with that guy. He wanted to know why our controller .was based in Bermuda. Why our auditor was a one-man operation .working out of a strip mall in upstate New York. It was a whole fucking thing with that guy. It\\'s not an easy conversation. I\\'ve already laid the groundwork for this. You\\'re hardly in the office anymore. I think what I say is that Andrew, sweetheart, .you don\\'t have to sell him on a decision .that you\\'re making for yourself.  This is about you? I know, I know. It\\'s just hard because I know he\\'s gonna be disappointed. Well, I\\'m not. I am very proud of you. Thanks. Okay, I\\'ll see you when I get home. I love you. Dad? You okay? What\\'s wrong? Oh, fucking back spasms. It\\'s all seized up. This is the only position that doesn\\'t kill. I\\'m sorry. Can I get you something? I already took a bunch of pills.  What\\'s up? Uh, nothing.  We can talk later? Look, what do you need? No, forget it. Well, fucking spit it out. Well, I wanna talk to you about a few things. Then spit it out. Come on. Well well, look um I\\'m thinking about taking office space somewhere else. You\\'re thinking about leaving the business? I\\'m ready to strike out on my own. And here I was worried about the business I handed you. Look, I have professional goals of my own. And I\\'d like to run my own company someday .and it\\'s obviously not happening here anytime soon. You\\'re pretty fucking selfish, Andrew. You got some fucking nerve. I\\'ve worked here forever and I\\'m still not a partner. It\\'s your name on the doors, as you love to say. You obviously can\\'t see how selfish you\\'re being right now. Let me ask you something, do you know what kind of offers I\\'ve gotten to sell this firm?  Do you? No, I don\\'t. The last one was from Goldman for a billion dollars. What? Why didn\\'t you take it? Because I didn\\'t wanna take it. I need it like I need a fucking hole in the head. And the main reason I didn\\'t take it .is because of you boys, that\\'s why. Because one day, I want this to be yours .with your name on the door. I mean, why else would you think I\\'d do it? You\\'re welcome.  You\\'re welcome? Yeah, I heard you. Bernie, how far does your wife know? Bernie, does your wife know? People familiar with the case .tell CBS News federal investigators .are ripping apart  years of fraud .inside Madoff\\'s firm, .moving beyond Bernie, .looking at sons Andrew and Mark .who directed trading activities, .and brother Peter, the company\\'s .chief compliance officer. None have been charged with any wrongdoing. So, now as Bernie Madoff prepares  for what may be his last night of comfort inHey. What is it? I don\\'t know, maybe it\\'s a waste of time, .but I thought that I would try to write. Write what? I don\\'t know, a book. Ah, it sounds stupid. No, it doesn\\'t sound stupid. It may not be any good, but I I, um .this is just the opening. Do you wanna hear it? Yeah, I\\'d love to hear it. \"Up until December th, 2008,\" \"I spent the entirety of my life\" \"in awe of my father.\" \"I judged every accomplishment,\" \"every failure, professionally or personally,\" \"against the life he lived.\" \"His approval meant everything,\" \"maybe too much,\" \"and for as long as I can remember,\" \"I worked as hard as I could to make him proud.\" \"And then one day,\" \"I found out that my father was not the man I thought.\" \"He was a criminal, a man I didn\\'t respect.\" \"And yet this man, my father,\" \"is the same man who taught me right from wrong,\" \"taught me to be fair and decent and honest,\" \"taught me about the importance of character,\" \"what it means to be a husband,\" \"and, most importantly, how to be a father.\" \"I am the son of Bernie Madoff.\" \"I used to think that I could never escape that.\" \"Now I\\'m certain I won\\'t.\" \"Why is it so hard to believe\" \"that those closest to him wouldn\\'t see him as a criminal?\" \"Why is it so hard to believe that his son\" \"would think his father could do no wrong?\" \"When I look at my youngest son, Nick,\" \"I fear the day when he\\'s old enough to ask\" \"what his grandfather was like.\" \"What kind of man was he?\" \"If I tell him he was evil,\" \"how can I explain that I\\'m\" \"that I\" It\\'s good, Mark. It\\'s really good. Yeah, I I don\\'t know. So, is it a plea deal? No. He\\'s just pleading guilty. So, he\\'s just gonna plead guilty .to all the charges and that\\'s it? It looks that way.  So there will be no trial? No. Have you read what they\\'re saying about us? Every fucking day they\\'re calling for our head .every paper, every blog. How are those people gonna know we\\'re innocent .if there\\'s no trial? How?!  How? The sooner he is locked up  Bullshit? This will be over. It\\'s gonna fucking linger. The questions, the suspicions, .the fucking paparazzi camped out Are they not charging him with conspiracy? No, he won\\'t plead guilty to conspiracy. Mr. Madoff, are you going to plead guilty? They should charge him anyway and force a trial. If they took Dad to trial, what would happen? Just think about it, Mark. You\\'re talking about putting the richest .and most powerful people in the world up on that stand. You\\'re talking about JP Morgan, Chase, HSBC, Swiss Banks. You\\'re talking about the world\\'s financial system on trial. Now, I\\'m not a conspiracy theorist, .but trust me, that will never happen. Ever. So, no, .there won\\'t be a trial. The public won\\'t know the truth. And we\\'ll be left to fend for ourselves. I don\\'t understand, Mark. Do you want a trial? No. Well, what do you want? I want my life back. We\\'re not here. Leave a message. Mom again. Hi, it\\'s me again. Your mother. I don\\'t know why I\\'m calling. I feel like such a moron .leaving all these messages, .begging you. I don\\'t know. I miss you. I miss Stephanie, I miss Audrey. I haven\\'t even seen little Nick. I haven\\'t even seen my grandson. What am I supposed to do, Mark? I\\'m stuck. I\\'m so sorry. I\\'m sorry for what he did. I don\\'t know what he was thinking. I can\\'t even fathom it. I just don\\'t understand why you\\'re so angry at me. I know you want me to leave him, .but I can\\'t just abandon him. How am I supposed to just walk out .of a  year marriage? He\\'s my lifetime. He\\'s my whole, entire memory. I don\\'t know anything else. I\\'ve never been on my own. I\\'m not as brave as you two. Call me. How do you now plead to count one .the charge of securities fraud, .guilty or not guilty? Guilty. How do you plead to count two .the charge of investment advisory fraud, .guilty or not guilty? Guilty. How do you now plead to count three .the charge of mail fraud? .guilty or not guilty? Guilty.  How do you now plead to count four? Guilty.  How do you now plead to count five? Guilty.  How do you now plead to count six? Guilty.  How do you now plead to count seven? Guilty.  How do you now plead to count eight? Guilty.  How do you now plead to count nine? Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. As Mr. Madoff has pled guilty, .he is no longer entitled to the presumption of innocence. In light of his age, he has incentive to flee. He has the means to flee .and thus, bail is revoked .and the defendant is remanded. Your Honor, would Your Honor consider, respectfully, .a stay so that we might appeal Your request for a stay is denied. Mr. Madoff, I will see you at sentencing.  Sorry, Bernie? We are adjourned. If you are visiting an inmate .in the maximum security wing, .form a single-file line to your right. Stop here. Keys. Turn around. Open your legs. In the cell next to me, they got this terrorist. Some sheikh. I can\\'t remember his name. But that\\'s my neighbor. Go figure. I don\\'t understand .why they put you in maximum security. Did you finish packing up the apartment? There\\'s not much left to pack. They\\'re taking everything. They even said to me, \"We\\'re gonna need your underwear and nightgowns.\"  Who said that? US Marshals. What would they want your underwear for? They\\'re gonna sell it. They\\'re gonna auction it off. It\\'s unbelievable. Nothing is off-limits to these people. I don\\'t even like to think about it. It\\'s so spooky. Have you spoken to the boys? No one speaks to me .except my sister. Joan even offered to let me come stay with her in Boca.  Well, she\\'s your sister? Yeah, I know, .but considering she and Bob lost everything they had It was all with you. I mean, it meant a lot to me. Yeah, that was unfortunate. That\\'s why I was hoping to have those few extra days .to make sure everyone was taken care of. I just feel like such a total putz. I I mean, when you don\\'t know what\\'s going on, .you don\\'t even know what to say. I mean, how am I supposed to explain the Cohmad withdrawals? You asked me to transfer money .from one account to another. I do it and a few hours later, .you tell me it\\'s all a Ponzi scheme. All these questions .and I don\\'t have any answers, Bernie. Even if you had told me, I\\'m not sure I would\\'ve turned you in. I don\\'t know what that says about me. That\\'s the tragedy of it. Mr. Madoff, are you scared you\\'re gonna lose your home? Mr. Madoff, what do you have to say to all of the people  Please go away. - What the hell is wrong with you?!  Please leave us alone. - Can you put the camera down? Do you feel guilty? Do you feel remorseful? You feeling like you\\'re scared? Do you feel any responsibility? What the hell is wrong with you?! What kind of person chases a family? You don\\'t have any right to touch my personal  I could sue you for shoving me? Oh, fuck you! Get in line. Do you enjoy this? Do you enjoy I don\\'t get it, Mark.  I don\\'t get it? What\\'s there to get? Your first instinct was to abandon us. I don\\'t get that.  I was waiting for you hereYou left his stroller .in the middle of the street, Mark.  It was on the sidewalk? It doesn\\'t matter. You just left me to deal with everything. Do you understand how unfair that is? This is about me. They want me.  This isn\\'t about you? No, this is about all of us. I I am sick and tired of you acting like it\\'s not.  You knowSo what do you want, Steph? You want a divorce? Just some acknowledgement. Financial swindler Bernie Madoff is awaiting sentencing .at the Manhattan Correctional Facility as investigators dig in .to see if those who were closest to Madoff Great. This is unbelievable. What has been called the largest Ponzi scheme ever. As we know, Bernie Madoff has continued to maintain .that he and only he perpetuated this crime. But it\\'s clear the money trail is not real. Every day, Mark sends you articles, .things he\\'s read, things that pissed him off. It\\'s not fair. It\\'s not fair to you and it\\'s not fair to me. I agree. He\\'s stuck. He keeps going in circles reading blog after blog. It\\'s unhealthy. But what do you want me to do, Catherine? Create a little distance. Well, that\\'d be easier if he wasn\\'t the only family member I have left. Mark and Andrew Madoff\\'s attorneys .say they are guilty of no crimes, .but authorities and victims are having trouble swallowing Andrew fucking Madoff. How have you been, Reed? Well, after your father fucked us all over, .things have been fucking fantastic. Yeah, lots of job interviews. No one willing to hire me, of course. Working at BLM for seven years, I guess I\\'m tainted. Well, I know it\\'s been tough on all of us, .but you\\'re a solid trader. You\\'ll find a job in no time. Yeah, I get a lot of questions. Yeah, especially about you, you and Mark. \"So the sons knew, right?\" \"They were in on it. They had to be, right?\" Reed, when I found out, it was like my head exploded.  I justShh, you hear that?  What? It\\'s the world\\'s tiniest violin .playing the world\\'s saddest fucking song. I understand you\\'re upset Yeah, well, how about making it right? 04\\'Cause I was looking at a $450, bonus. A lot of traders were owed bonuses, Reed. You weren\\'t the only one. We all got screwed. I thought you were all about family. Well, what the fuck am I? Am I not family, Andy? Come on, where\\'s the fucking money? What\\'d you do with the money? We all know you stole it. Of course you took it. You\\'re a criminal! I got fucked over, too! By my own father! My own father fucked me over! Yeah, is that your whore? I see you, whore!  Hey! YouHey! Hey! Stop it! Andy, get in the car. Hey! Jesus, get in the car. Jesus.  Asshole. Hey!Here\\'s your fucking latke,  knish or whatever, you fuck? Hey! Fuck you! I know you\\'re in on it! Ugh. The question is where did all the money go? Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee, .the liquidator, .is searching for the billions that disappeared .and trying to recover as much as possible .from Madoff\\'s remaining assets. Of all the people that should\\'ve known, .his brother and his sons, .who worked under the same roof with him, .should\\'ve known.  One would think so, yes. - Did they know? My belief is, yes, they knew. Clearly, they would have to have known what was going on  given their own personal transactionsOh, we should\\'ve known? We worked for market making. He worked for IA.  How would we have known? - If they turn out to be untouchable, .criminally, do you intend to bankrupt them civilly? Whether or not they have a criminal problem, .we will pursue them as far as we can pursue them. And if that leads to bankrupting them, .then that\\'s what will happen. The man sitting in this courtroom robbed me. He discarded me like roadkill. What can we possibly say good about Madoff .when he sank so low .as to steal from Elie Wiesel .as if Wiesel hasn\\'t already suffered enough in his lifetime. My wife and I are not millionaires. We worked hard for all our lives .and he took our entire life savings. Mr. Madoff not only defrauded thousands of investors, .he mastered the art of manipulating our government. The money Madoff stole from my family .had been set aside to take care of my brother .because he\\'s gonna need medical assistance for the rest of his life. If he\\'s attempting to protect his family, .he should not be given the opportunity .because we, his victims, .did not have the same opportunity .to protect our families. You have left your family with a legacy of shame. You have a marriage made in hell, .and that is where you are going to return. I only hope his prison sentence is long enough .that his jail cell becomes his coffin. May God spare you no mercy. I am responsible .for a great deal of suffering and pain. I understand that. I live in a tormented state .now knowing of all the pain and suffering .that I have created. That\\'s something I will live with .for the rest of my life. People have accused me of being silent .and not being sympathetic. That is not true. I apologize to my victims. I will turn and face you. I\\'m sorry. I know that doesn\\'t help. Your Honor, .thank you for listening. The message must be sent .that Mr. Madoff\\'s crimes .were extraordinarily evil. This kind of irresponsible manipulation of the system .takes a staggering human toll. Mr. Madoff will get what he deserves .and will be punished .according to his moral culpabilities. Mr. Madoff, please stand. It is the judgment of this court .that the defendant, Bernard L. Madoff, .shall be and hereby is sentenced .to a term of imprisonment of  years.  What about our money, Bernie?! - Yes! Where\\'s our money?! As a technical matter, .the sentence must be expressed in months.  years is equivalent .to 1, months. We are adjourned. We\\'re standing outside of the Federal Correctional Complex .in Butner, North Carolina, .where Bernie Madoff just arrived minutes ago. We saw Mr. Madoff arrive on a bus .with a group of other inmates .where he will serve his  year prison sentence. Officials have said he will be watched carefully .to ensure he is not a danger to himself .as he faces the long years ahead. Hmm. Visiting hours at the prison are very liberal, .and people close to the Madoffs say his wife Ruth .may well move to North Carolina to be close to her husband. Oh, fuck you, you asshole. I\\'m in Florida. Very much in love .just like Bonnie was to Clyde, Charlie. Bonnie robbed banks. Bonnie killed people.  And I\\'m Bonnie? by going to our blog \"The World Newser\" at abcnews? com. How am I Bonnie? Bonnie was a killer. Bonnie killed people. And I\\'m Bonnie? For  years, I kept this secret .from my wife, from my brother, .my sons. How I was able to do that .and maintain any degree of sanity, .well, that that worries me when I think about it. You already mentioned that. Yeah, I did. But while we\\'re on the subject, .you say you wanted to protect your family. Right. But just an example, .what would have happened .if at some point before the crisis of \\'08, .you\\'d been hit by a bus, you\\'d drop dead? Mark and Andrew would\\'ve become the owners .of a firm that was still in the middle .of perpetrating the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. Except the advisory was a completely separate business, .one in which they had no involvement, so But with you dead .and Frank probably willing .to swear to anything to save himself, .seems to me the odds are .that as owners as lifelong executives, .they\\'d have gone to jail. Your sons would be sitting there where you are. No, well, I protected them. You couldn\\'t have protected them if you were dead, Bernie. So who would\\'ve been held responsible? I would\\'ve been. They would\\'ve been, Bernie. They would\\'ve been held responsible, .which means one of two things is true. Either they actually were guilty .and accepted the risks .or you were willing to let your sons go to jail .for the crime you committed. Which is it, Bernie? I do like jousting with you. I\\'m not jousting with you, Bernie.  Yeah, wellI\\'m not jousting with you. It seems to me like .like you\\'re refusing .to recognize that hazard .you created for your family. Not just the day you were arrested, .but the hazard that they lived under, .unknowing, for, well, however long .you were operating this fraud. Eventually, they would be exonerated.  Period? How could you have been so certain of that, .that you were willing to risk it? Because they were never involved, ever, .and there\\'s no way it\\'s ever gonna be proven otherwise. So it doesn\\'t matter. It\\'s a terrible thing that they\\'re going through, .but they never would have been convicted .because they couldn\\'t be convicted. Because they didn\\'t do anything. Neither did my wife. Nothing. Zero.  But you know what you\\'ve doneI know what I\\'ve done.  Has shattered your family? I take full responsibility for that .and it\\'ll it\\'ll kill me for the rest of my life. But Over the course of the summer and fall of 2009, .the government auctioned off Madoff\\'s property. The beach house in Montauk  million. The penthouse in Manhattan  million. The Palm Beach house .available for $7. million. The Mercedes-Benz station wagon, yachts and power boats, Mets jacket, a hodgepodge of personal items By the fall of 2009, Picard had separately collected .roughly 1. billion .from the firm\\'s brokerage and bank accounts, .asset sales, and a few out-of-court settlements. We filed suit against Ruth Madoff .for  million. We have filed a clawback suit .against Mark and Andrew Madoff .for the return of $127. million. You can be in charge of the castle. You can be in charge of the dresses.  I get the dresses, right? Isn\\'t that wig hysterical? That\\'s great. Could you watch her for a minute? Mark, any time we try .to move on with our life, Bernie just finds a way to drag us back down.  I\\'m sick of it? I\\'m sorry. I tell you, you get angry. I don\\'t tell you, you get angry. What am I supposed to do? I don\\'t know. It\\'s just Oh, what the fuck is wrong with this guy? Suing our four-year-old daughter?  It\\'s insane? I know, I\\'m sorry. I just I hate that every time I start to feel normal again, something bad happens. Have you checked your text messages? No. Oh, my God, he\\'s so cute. I love you. I love you, too. Bye. Bye. Hey, Marty, I sent you the article. Did you get it? Anyway, please give me a call back. Hey, man, it\\'s me. What, are you away or something, 28\\'cause I called you earlier today and you didn\\'t answer. I left a message for Marty and he\\'s not there either. Like, nobody ever seems to be around. Everybody\\'s out of town or something. I\\'m leaving you another message. I know I keep leaving you messages, Andrew. I can\\'t even reach Stephanie. I can\\'t reach anybody! I\\'m seriously gonna lose it. I really am. I\\'m, like, trapped in here. Guess what. It\\'s me again. I don\\'t know if you\\'re away with Cath .are you away with Catherine? I mean, where are you guys, anyway? Have you gone fishing? It\\'s just, like, ever since she\\'s been in your life, I can\\'t fucking reach you anymore. I can\\'t ever talk to you. You\\'re just, like, always fucking on some holiday! Okay, ahem, I just left you, like, .a  minute message and I got cut off. Andy, Marty, I don\\'t even know who I\\'m leaving messages for. I\\'m just leaving messages now, you know what I mean? We\\'re supposed to just sit around and, like, you know, .with our dicks in our hands, doing nothing? You know, I\\'ve been at this for two years. Two years. Two years! I can\\'t keep going on this way! I have to make a statement. I gotta make a big statement! I can\\'t go on like this. We\\'re not here. Leave a message. Mark, are you there? Mark, pick up. Your call has been forwarded .to an automatic voice message system. At the tone, please record your message. Mark, I just tried the house. Uh uh, call me. Come in. Mom. What\\'s wrong? I just got these messages from Mark. Uh, I tried calling the house, .but he\\'s he\\'s not picking up. All right, yeah, I just I just pulled up. I\\'m going inside. I\\'ll call you back. All right. Mark? Hey! Hey, Nicky. What are you doing, huh? Wanna come with Papa? We\\'re gonna go outside. You wanna go outs Okay, uh. Grouper! Gotta get your blanky. Grouper, come back. Hey, Nicky, with Papa we\\'re gonna play peek-a-boo. Grouper, come! Grouper! Grouper! Grouper, come! Come on, that\\'s a good boy. That\\'s a good boy. Look at Grouper, good. We\\'re just gonna go outside. Hello? It\\'s Marty. Mark\\'s dead. Stephanie! He he hung himself? He\\'s dead. Has anybody called my mother? I have to call my mother. Andy? It\\'s so good to hear your voice, sweetheart. I wrote Bernie a letter .a week after Mark killed himself. And I never sent it to him .because they monitor his mail .and I thought they would never, ever .give him a letter like this. Well, here, you can say it on TV. He\\'s probably watching. Well, what I wrote to him was, \"Bernie, while I will not\" \"send you pictures of your grandchildren,\" \"there is one picture I do want you to see.\" \"That last picture of your son Mark.\" \"You owe it to his widow,\" \"his children, his brother, his mother.\" \"So, here is what I wish for you, Bernie.\" \"Every time you sit down to eat,\" \"as you pick up your plastic fork,\" \"I want you to see your son\\'s corpse\" \"hanging from the rafter directly over your table\" \"right on front of you, Bernie,\" \"so at every meal, you see your son Mark\" \"his white sweat socks are swaying\" \"ever so gently at your eye level\" \"immediately above your food dish.\" \"And as you look up, Bernie,\" \"you see\" \"you see your firstborn son hanging there,\" \"his head at a left leaning angle\" \"looking down at you,\" \"asking how could you do that to your son\" \"who up until two years before his death\" \"had given you the greatest gift\" \"his unconditional love for his father.\" Well, I hope he heard that. I hope he heard that? Well, he gets free television, .so why shouldn\\'t he hear it? Why isn\\'t he in a hole where he belongs? He says that he is happier in prison  than he was before? Free meals!  He feels safe in prison? His victims .are eating their dinner out of cat food cans. Then he says, \"The average person thinks I robbed widows and orphans.\" \"I made wealthy people wealthier.\" That is not true. Mark he wrote a note. The note said, \"Bernie, this is what happens\" \"when you destroy your sons\" \"by your life of deceit.\"Mm-hmm.  \"Fuck you, Bernie.\"Mm-hmm.  That was Mark\\'s suicide note? Right. I can\\'t keep coming here. I want a relationship with Andy .and he won\\'t see me if I keep coming here. I can\\'t have it both ways. No, I understand. And I can\\'t talk to you anymore. You can\\'t write to me or call me. It\\'ll be too hard. Ruth, all I want is what\\'s best .for you and for the boys. Boy, Bernie. Boy. You were my lifeguard. I thought you were gonna protect me forever. Best job I ever had. I never had to save anybody. I don\\'t know if it will ever .be any different than it feels now. I don\\'t think after losing a child .things ever get better. I don\\'t see much of a future for me. And I don\\'t really care if I have one. The future\\'s hard. Yeah, I was sorry to see that \"People Magazine\" .used that photo of you and Mark when he was a boy. I can never forgive you, Bernie. And yet I\\'m not angry at you. I don\\'t know why. It\\'s a combination of feeling numb .and it seeming fruitless. I don\\'t remember how much I got paid as a lifeguard, .but it was never about the money. In 2013, I invited Andrew to speak at a writing seminar I conducted at Princeton .under the general theme of writing about con artists. Andy had just started chemotherapy .for the reoccurrence of lymphoma. The topic I asked him to think about for the class .was how the media had covered his father\\'s case .and how that affected his life. I\\'ve always wondered, .why didn\\'t you go on TV and state your case? Why didn\\'t you defend yourself? Well, one of the reasons I\\'ve always felt uncomfortable .about the prospect of going on TV and telling my story .is that I don\\'t know if I\\'m that sympathetic a character. And at the end of the day, I lived a life of great wealth and privilege. I traveled the world. I wanted for nothing. All of that was subsidized .by my father\\'s victims. It\\'s hard to, um, tell our story Mark\\'s, my mother\\'s, myself .when there are so many other stories. My brother killed himself. My mother lost the only man she ever loved, .turned out to be a complete fraud. But, you know, there were just three of us. There are thousands of victims. And, uh Any other questions? Yes. The father-son relationship .is such an important factor in anyone\\'s life. There must be some part of that relationship with your father .that still exists. Even after all this, .can you see some point where you could visit him .or talk to him again? My father is dead to me. On September rd, 2014, .Andrew Madoff died .from mantle cell lymphoma. Hi, this is Ruth. Leave a message after the tone. Hi, Ruth, I just wanted to I know I, said I wouldn\\'t call, but I just, um .um, okay. Hi, this is Ruth. Leave a message after the tone. We\\'re sorry. You have reached a number that is no longer in service. If you feel that you have reached this recording in error, .please check the number and Hey, I was online today .and I\\'m reading some of the old coverage of me .and I came across this article. Frankly, it was just ridiculous. What was the article? The \"New York Times\" interviewed this guy, a forensic psychologist .who worked on the Ted Bundy case. And this guy, Joe Blow, .whom I\\'ve never met, never talked to .don\\'t know from Adam, never seen in my whole entire life .was going on and on about the similarities .between Ted Bundy and myself. Ah, I can see how that comparison would be troubling, but Well, there is no comparison. I mean, how can you compare me to someone .who decapitated women and kept their heads as mementos? I mean, that\\'s the behavior of a truly, truly evil human being. I mean, what comparison is there, ever, possibly in that? And yet the \"New York Times,\" .the newspaper of record, .all the news that\\'s fit to print .never had anyone say this is a preposterous piece of writing, .especially for the business section. Well, why do you think they made that comparison?  You know, when I turned myself inYour sons turned you in. No, no, but I turned myself in. It was a matter of a few days, so I was gonna do it. So anyway, when I turned myself in .it was the height of the whole anti-Wall Street hysteria .and they needed a villain, they needed a face .for the whole mess they created. That face became me, so that\\'s I don\\'t know, I just I don\\'t even wanna think about it. Think about what? Well, he killed people, innocent people. And in my case, I told people, everyone, \"Don\\'t put more than half your money with me.\" \"You never know. Who the hell knows?\" \"I mean, one day, I could just go crazy.\" But the reality is people are greedy. Hmm, the reality is that not even your warning was true .and you took their money anyway. Let me ask you a question. Do you think I\\'m a sociopath?'),\n",

       "   'Frank. How are the wife and kids? You know, for you, I\\'m considering treasury bonds and utility stocks. Smoke? In the late \\'s, banking wasn\\'t a job you went into to make large sums of money. It was a fucking snooze. How about those Mats\\'? Filled with losers. Like selling insurance or accounting. And if banking was boring, then the bond department at the bank was straight-up comatose. We all know about bonds. You give them to your snot-nosed kid when he turns 15. Maybe when he\\'s  he makes a hundred bucks. Boring. That is, until Lewis Ranieri came on the scene at Salomon Brothers. You might not know who he is, but he changed your life more than Michael Jordan, the iPod and YouTube put together. All right, gentlemen! Let\\'s get some money in here! Let\\'s make some money! What do you say? You see, Lewis didn\\'t know it yet, but he had already changed banking forever with one simple idea. The mortgage-backed security. Or private-label MBS. You\\'ve got your average person\\'s mortgage. Fixed rate,  years. Boring, safe, small payoff, right? But, when you have thousands of them all bundled together, suddenly the yield goes up but the risk is still small because, well, they\\'re mortgages! And who the hell doesn\\'t pay their mortgage? What exactly is the credit rating on this bond? This bond, gentlemen, is AAA-rated. This is exactly what the Michigan state pension fund has been looking for. I\\'ll buy $ million? Oh, come on, live a little.$ million. The money came raining down, and for the first time, the banker went from the country club to the strip club. Pretty soon, stocks and savings were almost inconsequential. They were doing $50, $100, $ billion in mortgage bonds and dozens of other securities a year. And America barely noticed as its number one industry became boring old banking. And then one day, almost  years later, in 2008, it all came crashing down. March. Bear Stearns was in a death spiral and the Fed brokered its sale. It\\'s been called the worst financial crisis in modern times. Certainly the largest financial disaster in decades in this country, and perhaps the end of an era in American business. In the end, Lewis Ranieri\\'s mortgage-backed security mutated into a monstrosity that collapsed the whole world economy. And none of the experts or leaders or talking heads had a clue it was coming. I\\'m guessing most of you still don\\'t really know what happened. Yeah, you got a soundbite you repeat so you don\\'t sound dumb, but come on. Our financial institutions are strong. But there were some who saw it coming. While the whole world was having a big old party, a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could. Not me. I\\'m not a weirdo. I\\'m pretty fucking cool. But we\\'ll meet again later. These outsiders saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy. And they saw it by doing something the rest of the suckers never thought to do. They looked. During the s, the housing market collapsed nationwide by roughly 80%. I mean, half of all mortgage debt was in default. And, I mean, there were very specific identifiers, extremely recognizable. I mean, for instance, one of the hallmarks of mania is the rapid rise in complexity and the rates of fraud. And did you know that they\\'re going up? I\\'ve always been more comfortable alone. I believe maybe it\\'s because of my glass eye. I lost the eye in a childhood illness. It separates me from people. And did you know that they are going Up? The highest fraud rates since the s. Hey, hey, it\\'s okay. It\\'s okay. No, I didn\\'t know that. In 1933, the fourth year of the Great Depression. Let\\'s wash it off and put it back in. You were playing so great, son. I even heard the coach say it. Can we just go home? Most social interactions are awkward for me and for the person. Even when I try to compliment someone, it comes out wrong. You have a very nice haircut. Did you do it yourself? What? No. No, I I\\'m sorry. I\\'m just I\\'m going on and on. My wife told me I need to share more.  That seems healthy? Yeah. So do I get the job? I really think I could help your fund. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Go on.  You\\'reDavid. Great. I guess I\\'ll go find a desk. Is there anything you want me to work on for start Yeah. You could let me know later. I could come back. Did you think it was strange when the tech bubble burst in  and the housing market in San Jose, the tech capital of the world, Went up?  Wasn\\'t that strange? No. No, it\\'s housing. Housing is always stable. Low risk. It\\'s solid. That\\'s the idea, yeah. I want you to get me the top  selling mortgage bonds. So you want to know what the top  selling mortgage bonds are? No, no, no, I want to know what mortgages are in each one. Okay, aren\\'t those mortgages made up of Wait, aren\\'t those bonds made up of thousands and thousands of mortgages? Yeah. Right away, Dr. Burry. I am a nice guy all day long. Ask anyone, I\\'m a pleasure to work with. But the second my son screws up, I am .yelling at him just like my dad did to me. I hear the words that are coming out of my mouth and Sorry I\\'m late! No cabs. So, get this. I met with this retail banker yesterday. I\\'m supposed to be getting him to invest in a fund, but instead I start grilling him about overdraft penalties and how his bank will let a customer write   checks before they tell them they\\'re overdrawn. And this creep is making billions off screwing over people this way. And I\\'m getting madder and madder. And I ask him, I look him in the face and I say, \"How can you sleep at night\" \"knowing that you are ripping off working people?\" And you know what he did? He left. He just walks out of the lunch, doesn\\'t say a word. What the fuck is that? Who\\'s fucked up in that scenario? Am I? Or is this douchebag, who leaves me hanging? Is he the fucked up one? We have talked about this numerous times. You can\\'t come in late and hijack the entire session. What do you mean? I didn\\'t hijack the meeting.  Did I hijack the session? Yeah.  What do you do? I\\'m in commodities. Good luck with that. Mark, I know you suffered a terrible loss. Maybe you want to talk about that. I don\\'t talk about that. Hold on. Hold on Shit, I have to take this. Sorry. Sorry. No I don\\'t care, Porter. This guy\\'s whole business is built on ripping people off. How long can that last? Bye, everybody! . That\\'s  days late Sixty days late They pay on time These FICO scores Late. And they caught up on their payments Another  days late LTV, . LTV, . They caught up on their payments Sixty days late? Jesus! LTV, 110? I\\'ve never heard of that! Thirty days late, rate adjusts In \\' rate adjusts In \\' rate adjusts . . Jesus! He hasn\\'t moved all day. He does this every few days. He hasn\\'t spoken to me since he hired me. Maybe the LTV\\'s at High-risk, interest-only I never heard of that mortgage history, I never heard of that How? Michael, how are you, guy? Lawrence, I found something really interesting. Great, Michael. Whenever you find something interesting, we all tend to make money. What stock are you valuing? No, no, no, no. No stocks. I want to short the housing market. Really? But the housing market is rock solid. Greenspan just said bubbles are regional, defaults are rare. Tell them I\\'ll be there in a minute.  Say again? Look, look Greenspan\\'s wrong. I don\\'t think you mean to do this, but sometimes you sound very dismissive and superior. It\\'s a fact. Greenspan\\'s wrong. I don\\'t know how else you want me to say Look, Michael. Metro Capital backed you four years ago when you were a doctor with a dinky webpage and some inheritance money. We\\'ve all done very well. Why don\\'t you just stick with stocks? Look. You know me. I, I, I I look for value wherever it can be found. And the fact is that these mortgage-backed securities are filled with extremely risky subprime adjustable-rate loans. And when the majority of the adjustable rates kick in, in \\'07, they will begin to fail. And if they fail above 15%, the whole bond is worthless. Michael, just take a beat. We\\'ll talk about this later, okay? Lawrence, please, don\\'t patronize me. Listen Mortgage-backed securities.  It, it, it - Subprime loans. Tranches. It\\'s pretty confusing, right? Does it make you feel bored? Or stupid? Well, it\\'s supposed to. Wall Street loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do. Or, even better, for you to just leave them the fuck alone. So here\\'s Margot Robbie in a bubble bath to explain. Basically, Lewis Ranieri\\'s mortgage bonds were amazingly profitable for the big banks. They made billions and billions on their 2% fee they got for selling each of these bonds. But then they started running out of mortgages to put in them. After all, there are only so many homes and so many people with good enough jobs to buy them, right? So the banks started filling these bonds with riskier and riskier mortgages. Thank you, Benter. That way they can keep that profit machine churning, right? By the way, these risky mortgages are called subprime. So whenever you hear \"subprime\", think \"shit\". Our friend Michael Burry found out that these mortgage bonds that were supposedly 65% AAA were actually just mostly full of shit. So now he\\'s going to \"short\" the bonds. Which means to \"bet against\". Got it? Good. Now fuck off. It\\'s only a matter of time before someone else sees this investment. We have to act now! How do you know the bonds are worthless? Aren\\'t they filled with fucking thousands of pages of mortgages? I read them.  You read them? I read yes. No one reads them. Only the lawyers who put them together read them. Look, I don\\'t think that they even know what they\\'ve made. The housing market is propped up on these bad loans, and I\\'m It\\'s a time bomb, and I want to short it. Through what instrument, Michael? There are no insurance contracts or options for mortgage bonds.  The bonds are too stable? Lawrence This is what I\\'m gonna do. I am gonna get a bank to make me one. And then I\\'m gonna buy it. I don\\'t want that kind of business. Money is not money. That\\'s bad money. Hey! Excuse me! Let me ask you this. What company treats its customers that shittily and succeeds? Fine. Okay, Goldman. You\\'re right. Mark Baum had built his career on never assuming anyone or any company was legit without proving it. When he was a kid he excelled at studying the Talmud in Yeshiva. Whatever. But one day his rabbi told his mom why. Paul is a fine boy, and Mark is an excellent student of the Torah and the Talmud. Then what\\'s the problem, rabbi? It\\'s the reason Mark is studying so hard. He\\'s looking for inconsistencies in the word of God! So has he found any? Later, Baum started his own fund on Wall Street. He had an amazing nose for bullshit. And he wasn\\'t afraid to let anyone know when and where the bull had gone number two. But then a tragedy happened to Mark, and it turned his world view dark and ready to believe the whole system was a lie. Hold on. It\\'s Cynthia. I\\'ll be in the office in  minutes. Hi, honey. The therapist called. You did it again. There were no cabs. What was I supposed to do? I worry about you, Mark. At least I went. You\\'re running around like you have to right  every wrong in the world? Okay. You\\'re so angry. Fine. You know what? I\\'m a mean guy and I\\'m pissed off. But it is a shit storm out here, sweetie. You have no idea the kind of crap people are pulling. And everyone\\'s walking around like they\\'re in a goddamn Enya video. They\\'re all getting screwed, you know. You know what they care about? They care about the ballgame. Or they care about what actress just went into rehab. I think you should try medication. No, no. We agreed. If it interfered with work. You hate Wall Street. Maybe it\\'s time to quit.  I love my job? You hate your job.  I love my job? You\\'re miserable. I love my job. I love my job, honey. Mark I am sad every day about what happened. I know you must feel the same, but you never show it. I know how close you were to your brother. Paul. Where\\'d you go, Paul? Paul! Every day I think you\\'re gonna talk about it, but you never do. Will you at least think about the idea of making a change? Fine. Fine. Honey, you know what? I will consider it. But, honestly, Cynthia. I\\'m okay. I really am. Hey, hey, hey! No, no. My cab. That\\'s my cab. That\\'s my cab. That is my cab. Schmuck. Fuck you? Fuck you. Fuck you? Fuck you. I\\'ll call you later. I want to buy swaps on mortgage bonds. A credit default swap that will pay off if the underlying bond fails. You want to bet against the housing market?  Yes? Why? Those bonds only fail if millions of Americans don\\'t pay their mortgages. That\\'s never happened in history. If you\\'ll excuse me, Dr. Burry, it seems like a foolish investment. Well, based on prevailing sentiment of the market and banks in popular culture, yes, it\\'s a foolish investment. But everyone\\'s wrong. That\\'s a good one. This is Wall Street, Dr. Burry. If you offer us free money, we are going to take it. My one concern is that when the bonds fail, I want to be certain of payment in case of solvency issues with your bank. I\\'m sorry, are you for real? You wanna bet against the housing market and you\\'re worried we won\\'t pay you? Yes, that\\'s correct. .unless the market crashes. The market on housing\\'s never gonna crash because it\\'s so solid right now. I mean, who doesn\\'t pay their mortgages? Dr. Burry, we could work out a pay-as-we-go structure that would pay out if the bonds fail. But it would also apply to your payments if the value of the mortgage bond goes up. You\\'d have to pay us monthly premiums. Is that acceptable, Dr. Burry? Yes. Yes. I have prospectuses on six mortgage-backed securities I want to short. Majority of the mortgages I don\\'t see us losing any money on these at all. Dr. Burry, these should be fine. Yeah. We\\'re prepared to sell you $ million in credit default swaps on these mortgage bonds. Can we make it $ million? Absolutely, we can make it $ million. We\\'ll be in touch, send some paperwork over. I like these cups. Can I take one for my son? Have Yes. Yes. Thank you. Have two. Is there any way to do $ million? I mean, we can. But are you sure? Absolutely. Absolutely, we can do that. We do different projects. We do gardening. The bonds I\\'d like to bet against. It\\'s not bad seeing yourself on the big screen. It\\'s very cool. I ordered the  ounce T-bone, which was choice. I went for volumeYeah. .rather than prime. I went for subprime, and the gist was Can I have like, lettuce, tomato, no onions? So, no onions. Lettuce, tomato, Thousand Island okay? Yeah. Hey, Randall! What\\'s with the Dom? Bonuses aren\\'t for three months. We just sold $ million in credit swaps for mortgage bonds. Some fund manager from California. It\\'s fucking crazy, right? A whole new way to make money, Doug. Wait, wait. I didn\\'t know there were swaps on mortgages. There are now. We made it for him. He must have gone off his Zoloft or something. I don\\'t know.  Want to join? No? Just a second. Hey, Jared. Did you hear about the deal that Randall just did with some fund manager? Randall? Bullshit. He\\'s a foot soldier. I\\'m sure it\\'s a shit deal. No, it\\'s for real. I told you we\\'d meet later. Unfortunately, it\\'s in a place like this which I would never be. I never hung out with these idiots after work, ever. I had fashion friends. Apparently, this guy wanted $ mil in credit default swaps. Randall made the sale. Can you believe it? Somebody shorted $ mil on mortgage bonds? That was just with Deutsche. Word is he hit half the town. How much in total? 1. billion. What? That\\'s pretty much all of Salon\\'s liquidity. Michael, this is highly distressing. Lawrence, that is not all of our liquidity. And I\\'m not certain that you really understand this trade. This is a certainty. Mike, I consider myself a mentor to you. But our company is not comfortable with this investment. Am I being clear? Lawrence, I have full autonomy when it comes to investment strategy. You can read our agreement. Do not throw our inception agreement in my face, Michael. We had an underlying understanding you wouldn\\'t act like a goddamn crazy man. This is not crazy. It\\'s all very logical. So, now we pay up premiums on these swaps against the housing market until the mortgages fail? In other words, we lose millions until something that\\'s never happened before happens? That\\'s correct. Hello, Mark Baum. Oh, hey, Kathy, you busted me.  I had a personal thing this afternoon? I\\'m not your babysitter. If FrontPoint makes money for Morgan Stanley, I\\'m happy. Okay. Hey, did I hear you\\'re expecting? We\\'re expecting to be expecting. LVF\\'s are cleaning us out but we\\'re staying positive That\\'s exciting! .lump on my ball. And I go in for a scan. Turns out that I have a very large thing called an epididymis. Which is a thing that goes around the ball and is like a sac underneath. I have an extremely  pronounced epididymis? I\\'m riveted I\\'m riveted by this. Do you have any pictures? It\\'s almost as large as another testicle unto itself. So get this. Cynthia Guys. Cynthia wants me to quit and open a B&B in Vermont. That sounds great. I\\'d love to see Mark Baum run a Bed & Breakfast. Like, \"Here\\'s your steel-cut oatmeal, asshole.\" Mark refused to kiss the ring of the people with the checkbooks, so he had to set up his fund under Morgan Stanley\\'s umbrella. His small team reflected his distrust of the system. You guys are sick. You\\'re sick. She says this job is making me unhappy. But you\\'re happy when you\\'re unhappy. I am happy when I\\'m unhappy. Vinnie Daniel. You know how to make a muffin? Mark\\'s numbers guy? Do you even know \\'now  to do laundry? Make a bed? Okay Vinnie lost his father to a violent crime when he was young. Just like Mark, he didn\\'t talk about it. I don\\'t talk about that. Cynthia\\'s no joke. She could actually make him move to Vermont. I mean, she made me start wearing a seatbelt.  Hey, you want me toPorter Collins. Former Olympic rower who went to Brown. He worked with Baum at a previous firm and couldn\\'t figure out why no one listened to Baum. The guy with all the good ideas. Sorry. I think you have the wrong FrontPoint. 9\\'Cause there is another FrontPoint in this same building that is bonds. And Danny Moses. The optimist of the bunch. And a hell of a trader. Which is the only reason they put up with his bullshit optimism. That was a weird call. You take longer with a wrong number than anybody else. It was this guy from Deutsche who was talking about shorting housing bonds. And then in the middle of the call I realized he had the wrong FrontPoint. And then \\'Cause he wanted the one on the th floor. He wanted to short housing bonds? That happens like five times a day that somebody gets the wrong FrontPoint.  We should change our name? Wait. Wait. He wanted to short housing bonds? Who bets against housing?  What\\'s the ABX at? What\\'s ABX? It tracks subprime mortgage bond value. Go back to sleep. The ABX is at Wow, it\\'s down! It\\'s down three points since last year. That\\'s weird. I haven\\'t heard a peep about that. What was this guy\\'s name? Jared Vennett. Vennett. That\\'s right. These lucky sons of bitches caught wind of one of the best trades in Wall Street history from a wrong number. They should have paid 10% to my fuckstick assistant. His name was Jared Vennett. Vennett. Jared Vennett from Deutsche. Sounded very sketchy. Sounds like a douchebag. Do you smell that? Do you smell that? I smell money. This is your basic mortgage Okay, hi. How are you? Have a seat. Okay, Mr. Vennett from Deutsche Bank. What do we have? There you go. So, how many people have you talked to about this trade? A few. There\\'s definitely some interest.  No!My boss would have my ass  N? O.!You crazy, Jared?  Get lost? Fuck you. Which is why you\\'re here talking to us, a wrong number. Sounds like there\\'s a lot of interest. All right. A few people have invited us in just to laugh at me on this deal. Is that you? Is that what this is? That\\'s not what this is. That\\'s just how Mark is.  Let\\'s see what you got? I\\'m sorry. You smell that? What is that?  What? What\\'s that smell?  Your cologne? No.  Opportunity? No. Money. Okay.  I smell money? Okay.  Chris, God damn it? Sorry. This is your basic mortgage bond. All right? The originals were simple. They were just thousands of AAA mortgages bundled together, guaranteed by the U? S. government. The modern ones are different. They\\'re private. And they\\'re made up of layers of tranches. The highest level, AAA, is getting paid first. The lowest rated, B, is getting paid last, taking on defaults first. Now, obviously, if you\\'re buying B\\'s, you could make more money. But they\\'re a little risky. Sometimes they fail. Chris? Somewhere along the line, these B\\'s and BB\\'s went from a little risky to dog shit. Where\\'s the trash? It\\'s right behind you. I\\'m talking rock-bottom FICO scores. No income verification. Adjustable rates. Dog shit! The default rates are already up from 1% to 4%, fellas. And if they rise to 8%, and they will, a lot of these BBB\\'s are going to zero, too. And that You\\'re too close.  is an opportunity? Okay. You\\'re saying that at 8% the bonds fail and we are already at 4%? That\\'s right. If they go to 8%, it\\'s Armageddon? Yeah. That\\'s right. How come nobody\\'s talking about this? You\\'re completely sure of the math? Look at him. That\\'s my quant. Your what? My quantitative! My math specialist. Look at him. You notice anything different about him? Look at his face. That\\'s pretty racist. Look at his eyes! I\\'ll give you a hint. His name\\'s Yang! He won a national math competition in China! He doesn\\'t even speak English! Yeah, I\\'m sure of the math. Actually, my name\\'s Jiang and I do speak English. Jared likes to say I don\\'t because he thinks it makes me seem more authentic. And I got second in that national math competition. So you\\'re offering us a chance to short this pile of blocks? How? With something called a credit default swap. It\\'s like insurance on the bond, and if it goes bust you can make  to-1, even  to- return. And it\\'s already slowly going bust!  to-1?  to-1? No way. And no one\\'s paying attention. No one is paying attention! Because the banks are too busy getting paid obscene fees to sell these bonds. But wait. You are the bank. You work for the bank. I bet your margins are pretty nice and fat. Let\\'s not talk about my margins, by the way. Being nice and fat, that\\'s a nice shirt. Do they make it for men? Aren\\'t you the bank? I work for the bank. I don\\'t think like a bank. Big bank, small bank, I like to make money. All right? Let me put it this way. I\\'m standing in front of a burning house And I\\'m offering you fire insurance on it. How can these underlying bonds be as bad as you say? It wouldn\\'t be legal. Nobody knows what\\'s in them. Nobody knows what\\'s in the bonds. I\\'ve seen some that are 65% AAA-rated that I know for a fact are filled with 95% subprime shit with FICOs below 550! Get the fuck out of here. You want me to really blow your mind? When the market deems a bond too risky to buy, what do you think we do with it?  Take a guess? I don\\'t know. You tell me. All right. You think we just warehouse it on the books? No. We just repackage it with a bunch of other shit that didn\\'t sell and put it into a CDO.  A CDO? Yes. A CDO.  What is that? This is where we take a bunch of B\\'s, BB\\'s and BBB\\'s that haven\\'t sold, and we put them in a pile. And when the pile gets large enough, the whole thing is suddenly considered diversified and the whores at the rating agency give it a 92%-93% AAA rating, no questions asked. Hold it. What? Say that again. A collateralized debt obligation. It\\'s important to understand because it\\'s what allowed a housing crisis to become a nationwide economic disaster. Here\\'s world-famous chef Anthony Bourdain to explain. Okay, I\\'m a chef on a Sunday afternoon setting the menu at a big restaurant. I ordered my fish on Friday, which is the mortgage bond that Michael Burry shorted. But some of the fresh fish doesn\\'t sell. I don\\'t know why. Maybe it just came out halibut has the intelligence of a dolphin. So, what am I going to do? Throw all this unsold fish, which is the BBB level of the bond, in the garbage and take the loss? No way. Being the crafty and morally onerous chef that I am, whatever crappy levels of the bond I don\\'t sell, I throw into a seafood stew. See, it\\'s not old fish. It\\'s a whole new thing! And the best part is they\\'re eating day-old halibut. That is a CDO. I just need to know, how could these possibly be collated? Somehow you\\'re like Dora the Explorer and you\\'re the first person  who found this thing? Hold on. Hold on. So mortgage bonds are dog shit, CDOs are dog shit wrapped in cat shit. Yeah, that\\'s right. Institutions treat these CDOs like they\\'re as solid as treasury bonds, and they\\'re going to zero. No. That can\\'t be right. There were $ billion in housing bonds sold last year alone. The rating agencies, the banks, the fucking government, you\\'re saying they\\'re all asleep at the wheel? Yeah. My whole department\\'s long on this stuff. They call me Chicken Little. They call me Bubble Boy. A\\'s, zero. B\\'s, zero. BB\\'s, zero. BBB\\'s, zero. And then that happens. What is that? That\\'s America\\'s housing market. Thank you. Fuckin\\' A, Jared. Shut your fucking mouth.  hang outwith you? Good. Okay. Sack up, do the deal. Let\\'s be friends. We will see. Thank you.  Don\\'t bullshit me? All right. You\\'re gonna say no, aren\\'t you? No. No, I\\'m just evaluating right now. Thank you. Thank you for coming in. Bye, Jared. I don\\'t like it. He\\'s playing us. He\\'s playing us. He\\'s got too much skin in the game and he\\'s dumping his position. What if he\\'s right?  You want him to be right? Yes, I do. The banks have given us 5% interest rates on credit cards. They have screwed us on student loans that we can never get out from under. Then this guy walks into my office and says those same banks got greedy, they lost track of the market, and I can profit off of their stupidity? Fuck, yeah, I want him to be right! How come you don\\'t hate this guy? He\\'s everything you taught us not to trust. I can\\'t hate him. He is so transparent in his self-interest that I kind of respect him. Would I buy a car from him? No. Is he right about the mortgage market?  No? Let\\'s find out. Let\\'s find out. Look. It\\'s two very simple questions. Is there a housing bubble? And if there is, how exposed are the banks? Yeah. Okay. Let\\'s get on this quickly too. Because if he\\'s right, every loser with a couple million bucks and a fund is gonna be jumping on this. Let\\'s go. Just that morning JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase. Okay. Stop saying \"JPMorgan Chase\". I got a good feeling about this. It\\'s just a meeting though, you know? It\\'s just a meeting. It\\'s something like People have meetings all the time. You know? People drink their coffee, they have a meeting.  Brownfield Fund? Yes!  Hey. Hello? Ted.  Chris. I\\'m on Ted\\'s desk? Chris. Okay.  I\\'m Charlie, Charlie Geller? Charlie.  Jamie Shipley. Hi? Jamie. We\\'re so excited to get set up on your trading platform. Cool. Here, have a seat a second. All right. So, I Ted had asked me to do some meeting prep. But I couldn\\'t find any marketing material on you guys. We just moved here from Boulder.  Yeah? Got it. Could we see some of your offering documents? Well, Brownfield is its own money.  It\\'s our money? Yeah. Can you tell us how much you manage? Of course. We\\'re doing $ million right now. But we started  four years ago with $110,000.Wow. So, as you can see, that\\'s pretty phenomenal returns. We want to get an ISDA agreement with JPMorgan so we can deal in long-term options.  That\\'s really cool? Yeah. That is so cool. Thank you. But you guys are under the capital requirements for an ISDA. By how much? One billion four hundred seventy million, so .a lot. This makes us look bad, doesn\\'t it, that we didn\\'t know what the capital requirements were? It\\'s not great. But keep up those returns and give us a call way down the line. You know. Okay?  Okay? Thanks, Chris.  Have a good one, guys? Thank you, Chris. Shit! Who the fuck schedules a meeting  at 4: in the afternoon? Oh, my, God. That was so painful. Dude, B of A and Bear didn\\'t even return our calls. And even fucking Wachovia  blew us off, man!I know. Here\\'s the prospectuses of all the other losers who didn\\'t make it past the lobby. I don\\'t think I can do this anymore. You know. I\\'m young, yet. I can still do something with my life. I miss Colorado anyway. The weed\\'s better. Gentlemen, I need you to leave. Yep, yep, we\\'re going. Let\\'s go. Look at this. Look at this. This guy says that the housing market\\'s a giant bubble. Okay, so this part isn\\'t totally accurate, you know. We didn\\'t find Jared Vennett\\'s housing bubble pitch in the lobby of a bank that rejected us. The truth is a friend had told Charlie about it, and I read about it in Grant\\'s Interest Rate Observer. This is crazy. This is crazy stuff. Shit, he\\'s saying that there\\'s to- returns on credit default swaps for mortgage-backed securities? And the whole housing market is about to collapse? For Jamie and Charlie, the housing market doomsday prediction was music to their ears. They had started working out of Jamie\\'s garage with $110, Jamie had saved taking sailboats up and down the East Coast. Our investment strategy was simple. People hate to think about bad things happening, so they always underestimate their likelihood. Their strategy was simple and brilliant. What he said. Jamie and Charlie found markets will sell options very cheaply on things they think will never happen. So when they were wrong, they were wrong small, but when they were right, they were right big. Within a few years they had turned $110, into $ million. But then it was time to go to New York City. And so far, it wasn\\'t going very well. So what if it does seem interesting. No No bank will give us our ISDA. We\\'re dead in the water. These kind of trades are totally out of the question. We got to call Ben. Let\\'s call Ben! Ben Rickert was a former trader in Singapore for Chase who quit the whole game in disgust. He happened to be Jamie\\'s neighbor when they were in Colorado and they met walking dogs. But Ben was dark. He didn\\'t just think the whole system would fail. He thought the whole world was going down. Every one of these vegetables is fresh from my garden. You guys should start your own garden. What you got to do is get your soil off the petrochemicals. I used wood ash and urine to help restore the soil. It creates ammonium nitrate. Seeds are gonna be the new currency. And not those Franken-seeds from Monsanto. I\\'m talking about good, healthy, organic seeds. Make yourself a garden.  Learn to live off the land? You\\'re a fucking lunatic. Ben had real experience in a big bank. Jamie and Charlie had never even been in a Manhattan bank bathroom. But Ben was done with the banking world. He was very clear. All right, let\\'s crunch some numbers and then maybe we\\'ll talk about calling Ben. We\\'re always crunching numbers. When haven\\'t we crunched the numbers? We\\'re gonna crunch the numbers like harder I need you out of here.  Of course. One second? Yes, ma\\'am. We\\'re going. Oh, God. I hate this. This is a total waste of time. Oh, come on. Would you relax? There\\'s a housing development  minutes outside town. Mark wants us to check that out first. Well, I hope there are some Cuban restaurants on the way there. Because I heard the Cuban food is amazing in Miami. Please don\\'t be chipper in the face of me being miserable. It really makes me hate you. How is wanting to eat good food being chipper? Hello? Hello? What do these go for? 425, each? What\\'s up, man? What do you want? Hello. I\\'m surveying mortgage owners who are over  days delinquent. I\\'m looking for a Harvey Humpsey. You want my landlord\\'s dog? Your landlord filled out his mortgage application using his dog\\'s name? I guess so. Wait, has that asshole not been paying his mortgage? 6\\'Cause I\\'ve been paying my rent. Well, yeah, he is over  days delinquent. Seriously, man, am I gonna have to leave? 7\\'Cause my kid just got settled in school, man. Hey. How are ya?  My name\\'s Ken? You\\'re Ken? You should talk to your landlord about that. I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t have any more information. But you You have a great day. See ya, Ken. There\\'s books everywhere! Books everywhere? Seriously, man, is everything gonna be okay? You should You should call him. You should give him a call. It\\'s not my fault, dude. I\\'ve been paying Hello! Looks like the Mary Celeste. Look. All they took was the TV. It\\'s weird. They didn\\'t even clean out the cat litter. Oh, God. It\\'s like Chernobyl. There\\'s like a hundred houses. There can\\'t be four people living here.  Oh, fuck that!Shit! He\\'s been in there for seven hours. Where does he go to the bathroom? I heard he had a breakdown. He\\'s letting the fund tank. My buddy in Manhattan said Dr. Burry\\'s office. No, he actually prefers that you email him. Excuse me. Mr. Fields, Mr  Hi, Lawrence? Holy shit! We have no confidence in your ability to identify macroeconomic trends. You flew here to tell me that? Why? Anyone can see that there is a real estate bubble. Actually, no one can see a bubble. That\\'s what makes it a bubble. That\\'s dumb, Lawrence. There\\'s always markers. Mortgage fraud has quintupled since  and the average take-home pay is flat, but home prices are soaring. That means the homes are debt, not assets. So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who gets his hair cut at Supercuts and doesn\\'t wear shoes, knows more than Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson. Well Dr. Mike Burry, yes, he does. That\\'s cute. That\\'s cute. Are you being sarcastic with us, Mike? Lawrence, I don\\'t know how to be sarcastic. I don\\'t know how to be funny. I don\\'t know how to work people. I I just know how to read numbers. How big is your short position right now? Just $1. billion.  And the premiums? Well, we pay roughly $ to  million each year, which is high, but I was the first to do this trade. Watch. It will pay. I may have been early, but I\\'m not wrong. It\\'s the same thing. It\\'s the same thing, Mike! You\\'re managing a fund of, what, $ million? In six years, it\\'ll all be gone. On one bet. No, the second quarter of \\' is when the adjustable rates kick in. The defaults will skyrocket. Yeah. Says you. How much is eligible for withdrawal before they do? Say, in the next two quarters. If your investors panic.  $ million? I My God, Mike. No one will pull out. That would be suicide. I mean, I\\'m down 17% for the year. But if they trust me, and they trust me, because No one trusts you! No one! I sent several emails to my investors letting them know that the .the second quarter of \\' is when our housing positions show returns and I\\'ve been very clear. People will withdraw their money. Lawrence, that would be so stupid. I mean, the If the fund\\'s capitals drop too much, then the swaps contracts are voided. And then the banks get to keep all of the collateral.  Wait a minute. Wait? All of it. The contracts are voided? The contracts are voided? Holy shit! Oh, motherfucker! Michael? Give me my money back. Michael, do you hear me? I want my money back. Give me my fucking money back .you motherfucker. The market\\'s in an itsy-bitsy little gully right now. It\\'s like everybody said, \"Okay, that was crazy.\" \"Let\\'s just all calm down.\" I sold that house for $350, the year it was built. Two years later, $480,000. Then $585, maybe  months ago. This couple bought it for $650, last year. He\\'d let it go for that. Hi, John. No, no, no. It will break his heart, but he\\'ll let it go. Why is he selling? Neither one\\'s working right now. Marlene, you\\'d say they\\'re motivated, right? As motivated as one can be in this neighborhood. This house on the left, I would say they\\'re probably motivated. Wow, a lot of people seem very motivated. Oh, it\\'s just the gully. That\\'s all. Just Just nerves. So where do we stand? I need to talk to my wife. This market won\\'t last. Actually, could I talk to a mortgage broker? Anybody you recommend? Anybody you like. Yes, yes, I have someone. Absolutely. Yeah, bitch better like me. Sent her ass to Cabo. So is Morgan Stanley recruiting us? Is that it? Oh, no. No. The bank owns our hedge fund, but we\\'re not really part of it. We invest in financial service companies and we\\'re trying to understand the residential mortgage business. How many loans do you write each month?  About 60.Yeah. What was it four years ago? Ten Maybe 15. Yeah, I was a bartender. Now I own a boat. You own a So how many of these are adjustable-rate mortgages?  Well, most? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I\\'d say about 90%. The bonuses on those skyrocketed a few years ago. Adjustable\\'s our bread and honey. So do applicants ever get rejected? Seriously? Look, if they get rejected, I suck at my job. Even if they have no money? Well, my firm offers NINJA loans.  Okay.\"No Income, No Job.\" I just leave the income section blank if I want. Corporate doesn\\'t care. These people just want homes. And they go with the flow.  Good for you? Your companies don\\'t verify? If I write a loan on Friday afternoon, a big bank will buy it by Monday lunch. Yeah. Same here.  Could you hold on a second? Yeah. I don\\'t get it. Why are they confessing? They\\'re not confessing. They\\'re bragging. Do people have any idea what they are buying? I focus on the immigrants, you know. Once they find out they\\'re getting a home, they sign where you tell them to sign. Don\\'t ask questions. Don\\'t understand the rates.  Fucking idiots? Yeah. And you target immigrants, too? Well, their credit actually isn\\'t bad enough for him. Look, I\\'m a yield guy. Okay I make $2, on a fixed-rate prime loan, right? But I can make $10, on a subprime adjustable. Trust me, I\\'m not driving a  Series without strippers. No one on the pole has good credit and they\\'re all cash rich. I think I read Warren Buffett say something like that. What? Who\\'s Warren Buffett? Okay, so strippers. Like exotic dancers? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nude, you know, topless.  Strippers? Yeah. Can you introduce us? Yes! Yes. I always get option-pay adjustables. I\\'m a private contractor. What? I can\\'t hear you. I\\'m sorry. I always get option-pay adjustables. I\\'m a private contractor. I need flexibility. And you tell the mortgage company what you do? I write \"therapist\".  You can touch me? Always? Only in V? I.P. No, no, no, you say you always do adjustables. And you have more than one loan on a property? Everybody does. At least down here. I\\'m sorry, what? Everybody does. At least down here. That way you only put down, like, 5%. Prices have leveled off, though, right? Yeah. There\\'s a gully. Would you mind not moving anymore? I\\'ll still pay you. Sorry. We\\'re not alone. Okay, look. If home prices don\\'t go up, you are not going to be able to refinance. And you\\'ll be stuck paying whatever your monthly payment is once it jumps up after your teaser rate expires. Your monthlies could go up 200%-300%. James says I can always refinance. Well, he\\'s a liar. Actually, in this particular case, James probably is wrong.  percent? On all my loans? What do you mean \"all\" your loans? We\\'re talking about two loans on one house, right? I have five houses. And a condo. Hey, there\\'s a bubble. How do you know? Trust me. Call Vennett, buy $ million in swaps on the MBS. What do we got? Garibaldi IV, BBB. Mark, are you sure? Yeah. Yeah, it\\'s time to call bullshit.  Bullshit on what? Every fucking thing. FrontPoint! FrontPoint! Is this America\\'s angriest hedge fund? All right, listen. I got one last question for you. How are you fucking us? There\\'s a nicer way to say that, Vinnie. I\\'m serious. We\\'ll buy your swaps, but only if you say how you\\'re fucking us. I\\'m not fucking you, Vinnie. I\\'m kissing you. I\\'m looking deep into your eyes as I make love to you, Vinnie. I\\'m handing you the deal of the century on a fucking platter. What do I get out of it? Easy. I got a $ million-a-month negative carry. I got bosses trying to pull the plug because they think I\\'m out of my fucking mind. All right? We make this trade, those problems aren\\'t so big anymore. And sure, swaps are a dark market, so I set the price. Whatever price I want. And when you come for the payday, I\\'m gonna rip your eyes out, I\\'m gonna make a fortune. But the good news is, Vinnie, you\\'re not gonna care because you\\'re gonna make so much fucking money. That\\'s what I get out of it. Want to know what you get out of it? You get the ice cream, the hot fudge, the banana, and the nuts. Right now, I get the sprinkles, and, yeah, if this goes through, I get the cherry. But you get the sundae, Vinnie. You get the sundae. All right, I buy that. Thank you. So what do you say?  You want me to make you a market? - Yeah. We\\'ll take $ million, Garibaldi IV, BBB. Sharpen your pencils. I\\'ll get the paperwork ready. Fuck you, too. Yes! That\\'s right. Oh, man. He has so many numbers, and I always forget which one he prefers, because he\\'s very specific. Start with the first one. I don\\'t know if it\\'s the first one. Just try it. Okay. I Okay.  Ben Rickert? Hey, Ben. It\\'s Jamie. Jamie, you know you\\'re not supposed to use this line. Told you. Okay, let\\'s try number two out of 14. Ben Rickert. Ben, why do you do that, man? I mean You\\'re a retired trader, okay? No one is listening to your calls. The NSA has a $ billion budget and the ability to monitor tens of millions of calls a second. You think they\\'re not using it? Hey, I promise I will refrain from saying \"Ben Rickert\" and \"dirty bomb\" in the same sent  Jesus fucking Christ? I\\'m sorry, dude. Ben Rickert. Did you get a chance to look at what we sent you, Ben? It\\'s Charlie. I\\'m here, too. Hi, Charlie. Yeah, I did. Hold on.  Ben, you still there? Yeah. I\\'ll be honest, gentlemen. It scared the shit out of me. But that\\'s a good thing, right? That means this Vennett guy\\'s not wrong. No, he\\'s not. Cool. Tell me more about these CDOs. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so, you know, Vennett mentions the CDOs, but actually, we took a look and they\\'re way worse than even he realizes. These things don\\'t make any sense! We can\\'t even model them. These are  times bigger than the MBS. And 90% AAA-rated.  Yes! Exactly!Over 90%. It\\'s incredible. I took a good hard look at the CDOs you want to short. They\\'re brilliant. Worthless. Total crap. Jamie. Very good. What can I say? I\\'m good at finding shit. So, Ben, we shorted the BB\\'s and the BBB\\'s, and the risk is relatively low. Payoff is, like,  to-1.Yeah. Okay, so, why are you calling me? I don\\'t do this anymore. Look, Ben? We need you to help us get the ISDA. If we get a hunting license, we can short this crap. And we know you hate Wall Street. We\\'re not asking you to do the trading. We\\'re simply asking you to help us get a seat at the fucking table. It\\'s a pretty ugly table, guys. Look, Ben, the system fucked up in a big, big way here, okay? And somehow we know before anyone else. You know? This is a once-in-a-lifetime deal. I\\'m thinking. Okay. I\\'ll call Deutsche Bank. Thank you, Ben. Thank you. And Bear. What about Bear? They have some reprehensible product. Okay. Bear will trade with anybody. All right. I\\'ll see if I can push it through. Thank you, Noah. And thank Jared for us.  Couldn\\'t we go inside? Yeah, me, too. Hi. It\\'s Mark. I need to talk to Vinnie right now. We\\'re just asking you to explain to us just how it is that you are fucking us, because what we are seeing Morgan Stanley building, fast. Are we hooked up to the same computer screen? It doesn\\'t make any sense. Vinnie, you there?  Mark, you there? Yeah, did you hear? Mortgage defaults have gone through the roof. Is anybody jumping off of buildings yet? Why would they? Subprime mortgage bond prices are up. What? Vennett wants $1. million more in collateral by close. Vennett\\'s asking us to post collateral. What the hell is going on? We don\\'t know, but Deutsche\\'s on the phone demanding payment. Call Vennett. Call that little shit. Call Vennett. Tell him to get his ass down here. So subprime loans go bad, but subprime bonds, which are made up of subprime loans, are more valuable? I know. They want another $1. million by market close. What about the ratings agencies? Moody\\'s, S&P Are they downgrading the CDOs and mortgage bonds? Where are the ratings agencies at?  They\\'re the fucking same? No, they\\'re all still AAA. What the hell? Are you fucking kidding me? Those fuckers! Those motherfuckers! They go public, and all they care about is their bottom line and their shit. Hey, Mark, that\\'s not all. The Morgan Stanley risk guys are here. They called in Kathy Tao. They\\'re trying to convince her to make us sell our swaps. Apparently, tying up six years of insurance payments in hopes of a housing Armageddon is not prudent investing? What did Kathy say? Nothing yet. She keeps asking if this is one of your crusades. Okay, I want you to walk back in there and very calmly, very politely, tell the risk assessors to fuck off. And then meet me over at Standard & Poor\\'s. We\\'re gonna talk to Georgia. All right. Okay. Get that fuck Jared Vennett in this office. I\\'m gonna bash his fucking head in. Gentlemen? I spoke with Mark Baum. He says to fuck off. I can\\'t see a damn thing. My eye doctor\\'s always busy. I end up taking any appointment they\\'ll give me, and then the whole morning gets shot to hell! So All righty, FrontPoint Partners, how can Standard & Poor\\'s help you? Well, we don\\'t understand why the ratings agencies haven\\'t downgraded subprime bonds since the underlying loans are clearly deteriorating. Well, the delinquency rates do have people worried, but they\\'re actually within our models.  SoSays you. .you\\'re convinced the underlying mortgages in these bonds are solid loans. That is our opinion, yes. Have you looked at the loan-level data? I mean, they\\'re giving these loans to anybody with a credit score and a pulse. Excuse me, sir. What do you think we do here all day? We\\'re not sure. That\\'s why we\\'re here. Here\\'s what I don\\'t understand We check, recheck, recheck again. If these mortgage bonds are so stable Perhaps you could check your friend. .have you ever refused to rate Ma\\'am, that\\'s delusional. We stand behind them. Georgia, have you ever refused to rate any of these bonds upper tranches AAA? Can we see the paperwork on those deals? I am under no obligation to share that information with you, whoever you might be. Just answer the question, Georgia. Can you name one time in the past year where you checked the tape and you didn\\'t give the banks the AAA percentage they wanted? If we don\\'t give them the ratings, they\\'ll go to Moody\\'s, right down the block. If we don\\'t work with them, they will go to our competitors. Not our fault. Simply the way the world works.  Holy shit? Yes, now you see. And I never said that. They\\'re selling ratings for fees. A ratings shop. You can afford to make less. Make less. Nobody said that. And it is not my decision. I have a boss.  Are you kidding me? No, I am not \"kidding you\". How\\'d your boss do on the IPO? Is that the angle you\\'re taking? So, now, anyone who has a boss can\\'t be held responsible for doing shitty and illegal things. What are you, four? No, lam not four, Mr. Baum. I am not, no. And I wonder what your incentives might be. Is it maybe in your best interest to have the ratings change? Is it, perhaps? How many credit default swaps do you own? It doesn\\'t make me wrong. No. It just makes you a hypocrite. Fuck! Mortgage delinquencies went up and the CDOs got more valuable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable? We know. It\\'s completely backwards. I just called an old friend at Bear. He didn\\'t even know what a CDO is. Yeah, I just had to wire Bear and Deutsche $70,000. It\\'s like two plus two equals fish. It\\'s rigged. We bought into a rigged game. We\\'re gonna lose everything. I\\'m gonna have to move back in with my mom. Can\\'t do that. All right. Well, I got a colonic appointment. Wait a minute. Hold on, Ben. Ben, look. Either the banks are clueless and they don\\'t know how to value these CDOs, or they\\'re such crooks that the CDOs are worth shit and they\\'re hiding it. I think we should buy more swaps. What? Suck it up and pay up, fellas. We made a deal. No way! No! Are you fucking kidding me? Are you serious? You think this is a game?  No? No? No? No? No? Yeah. Yeah. No! No! No! No, seriously, a colonic once a year. Ass! And you got a matching little butler boy, you buttfuck!  Are you done? I think so, yeah. God! I pulled a muscle in my back from yelling. Mortgage defaults have done nothing but go up. Yet you quote us a higher price on the bonds. Please explain that to me. There\\'s no way that makes sense. There\\'s no way you\\'re marking these swaps appropriately. Why shouldn\\'t we back out of this trade right now? Didn\\'t I say when we made this deal that the ratings agencies, the SEC and the big banks were clueless? Didn\\'t I say that?  Yes? Didn\\'t I say it? Yes, you did. You did. Shut up. Now their foot\\'s on fire, they think their steak is done, and you\\'re surprised? That\\'s not stupidity. That\\'s fraud. Tell me the difference between stupid and illegal, and I\\'ll have my wife\\'s brother arrested. That was funny. I guess you just don\\'t realize how clueless the system really is. Yes, there\\'s some shady shit going down, but trust me, it\\'s fueled by stupidity! Look at yourselves. You know, you pass yourself off as cynical people but you still have some faith in the system, don\\'t you? I don\\'t. Well, except for Vinnie. And who gives a shit?  No way!Look Either we\\'re right or we\\'re wrong in a giant, giant way. And if we\\'re wrong, then we got to find someone to help us get out of this trade. I\\'m not feeling remotely confident that we\\'re right. And if we\\'re wrong, who\\'s gonna tell us? Who understands this stuff? It makes no sense! I think we need to go to Vegas.  What\\'s in Vegas? Vegas? What the hell\\'s in Las Vegas? The American Securitization Forum is there next week. Every bond and CDO salesman, subprime lender and swap trader is gonna be there. I\\'m telling you, your bet is against dumb money. It\\'s about time you find out just how dumb that money really is. God, I hate Vegas. I hear the food has gotten really good in Vegas. They have a Nobu now. Would you fucking stop it? Any sense? And if a bond is \"rich\" it is  I don\\'t know, loaded with assets?\"Rich\" just means overpriced. I can\\'t sleep on planes, so I did my homework. Okay, let\\'s focus. What\\'s our goal? To figure out if this is a deal of a lifetime or if everyone here knows something we don\\'t and we\\'re gonna get royally screwed. Right. Remember that when you meet with the guys from Bear. I set you up with a face-to-face.  Awesome? Where is that? Holy shit. Five years ago, Securitization was a loser convention. 39100, maybe  people would show.  billion a year later, you get this. There\\'s a lot of smug-looking people in here, huh? It\\'s like someone hit a piÃ±ata filled with white people who suck at golf. I mean, who are all these clowns? Come on. I think it looks fun. Certainly. Vennett says these are the people we\\'re betting against.  Yeah, here we go. Here we go? There he is. Chris, on my left. Chris, on my left. Gentlemen. When do we get a chance to face time with some of these lovely folks? Chris, give him the keycards. Do you even know which keycards you\\'re giving out?  You\\'re just giving them out? Thank you. First of all, how was your travel? How are you? Uneventful?  Uneventful? Okay. I\\'ve been here for six hours. I\\'ve already been to the gym, I had two poached eggs and I played blackjack with Harry Dean Stanton. Thank you for your diary. Face time. I\\'d like some face time. Just remember. We\\'re here to gather information. We\\'re gathering information, okay? We\\'re not advertising our short position. All right? We don\\'t want to spook everybody. Can you do that? I know you got a big mouth, you like to run it. Can you just keep it shut for a few days? Okay. Okay. Yeah, don\\'t worry. We\\'ll play nice. Ladies and gentlemen. Business is good. Profits are strong and the mortgage continues to be the bedrock on which this economy is built. And, yes, we had to take some losses in our subprime department last year, but those losses will be contained at only 5%. Now, in our residential sector Mark, it\\'s not a Q and A. .our rollout of those variable rate packages were gobbled up by the consumers! I have a question, please. Sir, the Q and A is after my statements. But you know what? You seem anxious. How can I help you?  Thank you. How are you? Fine, thank you. Would you say that it is a possibility or a probability that subprime losses stop at 5%? Thank you. I would say it is a very strong probability, indeed. So back to the residential sector. When we rolled out the new variable rates package Excuse me. Yes, sir. Zero! Zero! There is a 0% chance that your subprime losses will stop at 5%. Zero. Excuse me. I have to take this. He must be from Bank of America.  Our subprime department is fine? No, I\\'m not doing anything right now. As I was saying, our residential department How are the kids? .consumers reacted to our packages Mark Baum really did that. When we were in Vegas, he did that. He said that, he took the call. Now you see what I had to deal with? Yeah, the Beretta Meh. But this Uzi is fucking awesome! I need this CDO machine to run for another two years. And then I\\'m rich as fuck and I got my house in Aspen. But do you have any concerns about the performance of the underlying securitizations? It\\'s easy to see that delinquencies and default rates are on the rise right now. Could you please stop being such a buzzkill, dude? We didn\\'t bring you out here to talk about work, bro. Why did you bring us out here? Because we need to be able to expense the ammo to a client. I\\'m gonna go shoot some terrorists. Watch how it\\'s done, boys!  These guys are morons? Fucking tool. These guys are morons.  Fuck, yes! Boom!Yeah, man! We need to be buying up every swap we can get our hands on here. Just hold on, okay? Hold on. My brother\\'s ex-girlfriend works for the SEC. She just told me she\\'s in town, okay? So, if we\\'re missing something, maybe she can tell me. You know, give me some insight. In the meantime, you go to the main floor and price some swaps. Well, actually, we\\'re about to invest in housing bonds, and I was wondering if the SEC is worried about them at all. I know you\\'re not allowed to tell me specifics, but just generally. We don\\'t investigate mortgage bonds. Truth is, since we got our budget cut, we don\\'t investigate much.  Then why are you here? I thoughtI\\'m not here for the SEC. I\\'m here on my own dime. I\\'m floating my resume to some big banks. How\\'s your brother, by the way? How are you floating your resume to big banks? I mean, you\\'re supposed to be the ones, you know, policing the big banks. Grow up, Jamie. There must be some kind of law against working for a financial institution right after you\\'ve been working in financial regulation, right? No. No. Hey! Dougie! Hey! Come over here. What are you doing at Caesars? He\\'s at Goldman. See you. We can do BBB-level swaps at  basis points. Maybe. You\\'re pricing the swaps like the bond is gonna collapse even though the bond value\\'s going up? Really? Sign of the times. What the hell is going on? Lewis, can you come in early tomorrow, please? I need to unload the AIG and Countrywide and Freddie Mac positions so that we can afford the premiums on the .core mortgage shorts on the swaps. No problem, Dr. Burry. Dr. Burry? If the investors withdraw, what\\'s going to happen here? Are we done? Honestly, I don\\'t know. The bonds aren\\'t going down. They won\\'t move. It\\'s possible that we are in a completely fraudulent system. Or you\\'re wrong. Sure. It\\'s possible I\\'m wrong. I just don\\'t know how. I guess when someone\\'s wrong, they never They never know how.  See you in the morning? Yeah. Even Bear upped their prices. And they keep calling us Brownhole. You just don\\'t have the money or the reputation. Don\\'t take it personally. I don\\'t think I have the strip club in me tonight. I\\'m just gonna get some ginger ale and watch some pay-per-view. I\\'ll book us some flights out for the morning. A deal. We need a deal, right? A deal. We need a deal we can afford. We need a deal that they\\'re not gonna refuse. So what can we do? We can The AA tranches. What if we bet against the AA tranches? Who\\'s not gonna take that bet? We know that they say they\\'re 95% AAA-rated, but in reality they\\'re more like 25%. Some of them are 0%! We also know that if the bottom tranches fail at over 8%, the upper tranches are affected. They go to zero. I\\'ll bet you right now that those AA\\'s are actually like B\\'s. I rarely ever say these words, but I think Charlie\\'s right. Look, Ben. The payoff is  to 1. But they\\'re all taking the ratings at face value. So they\\'re charging pennies on the dollar a bet against the AA\\'s. Just when I start thinking you guys are clowns No one on the planet\\'s betting against AA\\'s. The banks will think we\\'re either high or having a stroke. They\\'ll take every dime we have to offer. Kinda brilliant. This is what we did that no one else thought of. Not even Baum or Burry thought to short the AA\\'s. But we did. Little Brownhole Capital. We\\'re interested in shorting some of the AA tranche of CDOs. Come on, guys, what\\'s the angle? Oh, got no angle. We\\'re new to this. We\\'re just excited. We want to do $ million in swaps on the AA tranche. I don\\'t understand. You can buy as much AA tranche as you want.  million against the AA. Brother, I will sell you as much as you want. You understand perfectly, Bob. You want the deal? That\\'s cool. That\\'s all right with me. Pleasure. Don\\'t do that. Stop. Stop.  Stop that? Charlie. Stop it! Stop. What? Do you have any idea what you just did? Come on. We just made the deal of our lifetimes! We should celebrate. You just bet against the American economy. Fuck, yeah, we did!  Fuck, yeah!Which means Which means if we\\'re right If we\\'re right, people lose homes. People lose jobs. People lose retirement savings. People lose pensions. You know what I hate about fucking banking? It reduces people to numbers. Here\\'s a number. Every 1% unemployment goes up, 0, people die. Did you know that?  No? Did you know that? No, I didn\\'t know that. We were just excited. Just don\\'t fucking dance.  All right? Where are you going? Whoa, I just got really scared. First of all, great show today.  You were terrific? Thank you. Your big mouth was a revelation. I appreciate that. You worried you and your swaps are getting played? Well, this is an opportunity for you to meet who you\\'re betting against. Try not to get too righteous and listen a little. Okay, fine. Who is this guy? A real solid-gold asshole.  I\\'m a CDO manager? A \"CDO manager\"? Yeah, at Harding Advisors. I didn\\'t realize that there was anything to manage with CDOs. We select the securities that go into the CDO portfolio and monitor the assets. I do most of Merrill Lynch\\'s CDOs. Do you represent the investors or Merrill Lynch?  The investors? You do.  Yeah? But Merrill Lynch isn\\'t gonna send you any customers unless you put Merrill Lynch\\'s bonds in your CDO. Good question. Let\\'s just say Merrill and I have We have a good relationship. You have a good relationship with Merrill Lynch. We\\'ve been doing business together for a long time. And so the CDOs that you create are of the highest quality and the highest value.  Absolutely. Yep? Absolutely. Are you at all concerned about the rising default rates? I assume no risk for these products myself, Mark. Okay. So let me get this straight. The bank calls you up. They give you the bonds they want to sell. They give you clients, they give you money to run your business. Give you fat fees for doing so. But you represent the investors?  Is that right? Yeah. But we\\'re not in the Merrill Lynch building.  Okay. Where are you? We\\'re in New Jersey. You\\'re  minutes away. Well, five if you use a helicopter.  That\\'s funny, huh? That\\'s hilarious. Oh, boy. Your boss is about to explode. No, he\\'s too curious to explode. Hold on. Say that again. CDO \"A\" has parts of CDO \"B\". And CDO \"B\" has parts of CDO \"A\". But then they both get put inside CDO \"C\". Yeah, that one\\'s called CDO squared. \"A CDO of a CDO\". All right? And then there\\'s CDOs made up of the opposite side of the bet you made with your swaps. We call them synthetic CDOs. What did you say? Synthetic CDOs.  That is fucking crazy? It\\'s not. It\\'s awesome. His face is starting to boil. He looks like the bad guy from Dune. All right, let\\'s say you have a pool of $ million in subprime loans. How much money could be out there betting on it, in your synthetic CDOs and swaps right now, tonight? Let\\'s see, $ million  A billion dollars? What? If the mortgage bonds that Michael Burry discovered were the match How much bigger is the market for insuring mortgage bonds than actual mortgages? About  times. If the mortgage bonds were the match and the CDOs were the kerosene-soaked rags, then the synthetic CDO was the atomic bomb with the drunk President holding his finger over the button. It was at that moment in that dumb restaurant with that stupid look on his face that Mark Baum realized that the whole world economy might collapse. And I know what you\\'re thinking. \"What the fuck is a synthetic CDO?\" Well, here\\'s Dr. Richard Thaler, father of behavioral economics and Selena Gomez to explain. Okay. So here\\'s how a synthetic CDO works. Let\\'s say I bet $ million on a blackjack hand.  million because this hand is meant to represent a single mortgage bond. Okay, Selena has a pretty good hand here, showing 18. Dealer showing seven. That\\'s a really good hand for Selena. Good odds. In fact, her chances of winning this hand are 87%. So, my odds are good. I\\'m on a winning streak. Everybody in this place wants to get in on the action. How could I lose, right? Now, this is a classic error. In basketball it\\'s called the Hot Hand Fallacy. A player makes a bunch of shots in a row. People are sure they\\'re gonna make the next one. People think that whatever\\'s happening now is gonna continue to happen into the future. During the real estate boom, markets were going up and up and people thought they would never go down. So people who are watching and think that I won\\'t lose will make a side bet. Now, this is the first synthetic CDO. I love Selena Gomez. I bet you $ million she wins. And I\\'ll give you to- odds.  to- odds? Okay, I\\'ll take that bet. Now, somebody else is gonna want to make a bet  on the outcome of their bet? Bet you  million she wins. That will lead to synthetic CDO number two. Hey, I bet you $ million that lady in the glasses wins that bet. She probably will win. So I want a great payoff.  How about  to-1?Deal. And this will go on and on with more and more synthetic CDOs. And we can transform an original $ million investment into billions of dollars. You okay? No. I actually feel pretty sick. So I\\'m going to leave. You think I\\'m a parasite, don\\'t you, Mr. Baum? But, apparently, society values me very much. In fact, let\\'s do this. I\\'ll tell you how much I\\'m worth. You tell me how much you\\'re worth. God, you are an incredibly big piece of shit. Short everything that guy has touched. I want half a billion more in swaps. You sure about that? The collateral calls could bankrupt you.  Yeah. Yeah? Where are you going? I am going to try to find moral redemption at the roulette table. Hey, hey, hey! Things are worse than I thought. I honestly think the economy might collapse. But you\\'ve been saying that the system\\'s broken for years, Mark. So Why are you so shocked? It\\'s more twisted than I could have imagined. You love to be the virtuous one. I\\'m a banker. I\\'m a part of it. You always have, Mark. Like you\\'re untainted. It changed me. It changed me into a person who is not able to reach out to someone He was in pain. My brother was in real pain. There\\'s no perfect way to help. It\\'s sad. It\\'s scary. So stop trying to fix the world. He told me You\\'re not a saint. Saints don\\'t live on Park Avenue. .that he was having bad thoughts. Just feel the feelings like the rest of us. My first response was to offer him some money. I offered him fucking money! His face was so smashed. That\\'s right. Michael?  Michael? Yes. Yes.  Is everything okay? Yes, honey.  You sure? Yeah, baby. I\\'m fine. To all investors. As you may know, our agreement allows me to take extraordinary measures when markets aren\\'t functioning properly. I currently have reason to believe the mortgage bond market is fraudulent. So, in order to protect investors from this fraudulent market, I\\'ve decided to restrict investors\\' withdrawals until further notice. Sincerely, Dr. Michael J. Burry. I never would have guessed my life could change as much as it has since I moved to L? A. It\\'s not just, like, that easy to, like, not see you. He lashed out at rumors he used performance enhancing drugs. This record is not tainted. Oh, my God, dude. Will you please stop changing the channels?  You\\'re driving me crazy? All right.  Fine? Just put the business news on. and the S&P picked up three points? Jesus! Mortgage meltdown continued today. Subprime mortgage lender New Century Financial, once the industry leader, by the way, filed for bankruptcy. The company immediatelyWhoa, whoa, whoa. Good time for my voice to go Fired 3, workers. The manufacturing index also fell in the month of March It\\'s starting. .a warning that economic growth could slow. The Institute of Supply Management also reported a rise in prices I\\'m gonna call my mom. The principal source of the slowdown in economic growth Time and time and time again, I have gone to bat for you, Mark! We\\'ve known each other for seven years She\\'s got some lungs on her. I\\'m impressed. I can\\'t help but enjoy it. There\\'s no fucking way. There\\'s no fucking way that the big banks are that stupid. Bye, Kathy! Well? Kathy thinks that it would be a good idea if we sold our shorts. What else is new? And she said that Morgan Stanley will buy them. Holy shit! What did you say? I told her we\\'re not selling shit. If you need the files for . Mr. Fields\\' suit is very specific to files from the past year. Good. Then get out. Say hi to Lawrence for me. Will do. You can\\'t call me back for a week? I am so sorry, Mike. Goldman had a systems failure. I lost a ton of messages. Yeah, B of A said they had a power outage, and Morgan Stanley said their server crashed. That\\'s weird. Well, I would call it improbable. So where do you have our position marked? I think it\\'s the same, Mike. What? Can you explain that to me, please, because how can the value of an insurance contract not be affected by the demise of the very thing it insures? They\\'re independent markets. They\\'re not always correlated. I know it sounds odd, but these are very complicated products. They are correlated. They\\'re gonna lose their houses, they\\'re gonna lose their jobs, they\\'re gonna lose their Will you listen to me? This is like the end of capitalism. This is like the Dark Ages all over again. I don\\'t want to talk to Dad. Okay, I love you, too. Save your money. She says I need to be on Xanax and double my dose of Zoloft. I asked Bear Stearns to price our shorts. They tell me the CDOs still haven\\'t moved. This is fucking insane! You realize that? These people are crooks and they should be in prison. Look at the TABX. You can see that the CDOs are worth zero! So you know what they\\'re doing, huh? You know what they\\'re doing, right? Yeah. They\\'re unloading them. They\\'re selling their dog shit CDOs, then they go to another bank and short the shit they just fucking sold! Let\\'s go to the press, man! This is a massive story. Who wouldn\\'t publish it? Robert Redford! No, you don\\'t understand! I got it, guys. I got it. What am I supposed to do? Do you want me to write a piece called \"We\\'re All Fucked\"? Yes! That\\'s a perfect title! Casey, right now every bank in town is unloading these shit bonds onto unsuspecting customers. And they won\\'t devalue them until they get them off their books. This level of criminality is unprecedented, even on fucking Wall Street. Jamie And this is me being honest here, okay? It took me years to build my relationships on Wall Street. No bank or ratings agency is going to confirm a story like this just because it comes from two guys in a Sorry, garage band hedge fund that thinks it\\'s the apocalypse. Wow. I thought you were for real, Casey. You know, I\\'ll have to say I really did. Really? Yeah, Jamie, you try being for real with a three-year-old and a wife getting her master\\'s degree. I\\'m not gonna burn my reputation on your wild hunch. Wow. Wow. Thanks for coming, guys. Totally fucking awesome to see you. Yeah, Casey. I\\'ve always hated you, because you were a prick in college and you are a prick today! Thanks, Charlie. Still living with your mom? Charlie, come on! Mark Baum again. Call me. Subprime bonds fell off a cliff. Rumor has it the default numbers are huge. Who got the remittance data early? I bet it\\'s Goldman. Yeah, fuck you very much. Jared, it\\'s chaos down here. Where are we? \"And Caesar wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.\" Shane? Shane? Well, nobody\\'s buying CDO or mortgage bonds anymore and everybody wants swaps. Swaps are now the most popular product on the street.  That\\'s good for us? Yes and no. I heard from somebody who heard from somebody No, Alex, no. Sorry. Bennie Cleager over at Morgan is taking on some heavy losses in the bond department. Your ship might be taking on water. It might be time to get our lifejacket and get out. I\\'m jacked. I\\'m jacked! I\\'m jacked to the tits! Good. Do you feel it? No. What\\'d you hear, Tommy? It\\'s happening. Everybody wants our swaps. Kathy\\'s office is looking for you. They\\'re singing a different tune now, aren\\'t they? That\\'s not good. Maybe later. Not now. This is a joke. Never. Listening. Dr. Burry? Yeah. Deeb Winston, Goldman Sachs. Listen, I\\'ve been reviewing your position. I wanted to discuss your marks and make sure they\\'re fair. Yeah, I think you mean that you\\'ve secured a net short position yourselves. So you\\'re free to mark my swaps accurately for once because it\\'s now in your interest to do so. I\\'m not sure what you want me to say. I think that I think that you\\'ve already said it. You tell Jeff at Goldman that I\\'m not transferring funds. This is bullshit! Okay, we\\'ll talk later. Thank you. Thanks for coming so quickly, Mark. Yeah. I know you\\'ve been hearing rumblings about some losses Morgan has suffered.  Congratulations? On what? Thanks. Having fun? Yes. Tons. I just wanted you to know that That, yes, Morgan has suffered some losses, but our liquidity is strong and there\\'s no cause for concern. Would Bennie Cleager be concerned? Because word on the street is that he took some pretty heavy losses. Kathy, come on. We know each other. What\\'s going on? How bad is this? Okay. Two years ago, Bennie Cleager in Morgan\\'s bond department also started shorting subprime housing, $ billion in BBBs. Bennie is smarter than I thought. No, he\\'s not smart at all. The premiums on the swap ate into his desk\\'s profit. To cover his BBB shorts, he sold a lot of A and AA swaps as protection. A lot. He believed that there was no way that they could be affected. Tell me Morgan Stanley doesn\\'t hold the contracts on these swaps. Holy shit. All this time I\\'ve been trying to figure out who I\\'m betting against, and it\\'s Morgan Stanley. Which is me. What\\'s your exposure? $ billion? Please, don\\'t tell me it\\'s more than four. I can\\'t answer that. I can\\'t answer that. Yes, you can answer that, because I walk in here and people are crying in your hallway. Kathy, you bring me in to tell me everything\\'s fine, and everything\\'s not fine. What, what is happening? The long exposure is .$ billion. Jesus! He kept saying defaults over 8% were impossible. Oh, my God. That there would be a million homeless! Yeah, but we have nothing to do with Morgan Stanley. Yeah Tell the bankruptcy court. Morgan fails, all our accounts go on their balance sheet. It\\'s just crazy. Morgan makes the sucker\\'s bet and we pay their fucking gambling debt? Short the bank stocks. Then we wait. Or we sell our swaps when the market opens. We get our bonuses, our investors get their profits, we get What,  cents on the dollar? It\\'s not bad. We\\'re three times that. Not if there\\'s no market left to sell them in. Forget it. We\\'re not giving out any lifeboats. If Morgan goes under, we end up with nothing. Vinnie. Jesus, come on. I say when we sell. Look, I get that this is personal for you, but we have a fiduciary responsibility. No. No, we don\\'t. Nobody\\'s acting responsible. Fuck responsibility. Are you kidding me? The assholes at the big banks will take You boys want any appetizers? We\\'re talking, please!  Excuse us? Sorry. We are going to wait, and we are going to wait, and we are going to wait until they feel the pain, until they start to bleed.  That is what I want? But what about our clients who\\'ve entrusted us with their savings I say when we sell. This isn\\'t about you. This isn\\'t about you and your Upper East Side  mahogany soapbox? Hey! Hey! I say when we sell! Whatever you say, Mark. Dude, did you hear the news? Okay. So, not only do two mortgage hedge funds backed by Bear Stearns go belly up, but now there\\'s a class-action lawsuit against Bear. Holy shit! Let\\'s go! Push! Push! So, what? Bear could really collapse here.  This is a risk we really shouldn\\'t take. - Then what? We bought 80% of our swaps at Bear.  We\\'d lose everything. - So what?  Hey, sir? One second! That\\'s my opinion. We bought these fucking things. We have no clue how to sell them. I know. We have to get Ben to do it. I\\'ve been trying to call him and he won\\'t get back to me. No. He\\'s on vacation with his wife\\'s family. They\\'re in England. What? Hello, Ben. Hey? Guys? Yeah, we\\'re here. Can you hear us? Guys? Yeah, we got you. Yeah. I hardly got cell phone or Wi-Fi service. I\\'m trying to sell $ million worth of securities. In a pub. It smells like sheep. You can do this. I don\\'t want to pressure you, Ben but if you don\\'t pull this off, we lose everything. All right. Let\\'s see what Credit Suisse\\'s appetite is. This is Brownfield Fund. I want to unload my credit default swaps. All right. What you got? Twenty AA tranches of A? B.S. CDOs. A? B.S.? Are these These are pretty bad? Absolutely. They\\'re complete shit. What\\'s your notional value? Face value is  million. Dollars. All right, we could, we could go to forty. No. We want at least  million.  million? Who are you, a drug dealer or a banker? 05\\'Cause if you\\'re a banker, you can fuck right off! I don\\'t know if we can make a market. Just give me your best price? Yeah. Chuck  million in for me, mate. I think we\\'re far apart. Look, if you don\\'t want the deal, you can just hang up. That\\'s what I thought.   million.70. 0585. 78.84. 78.84. It\\'s Dr. Burry. Looks like the collapse of the financial sector is imminent. Let\\'s start to sell my position. It\\'s $1. billion. Sure, I\\'ll hold. So, I was right. I took a rash of shit for two years, but I was right. And everyone was wrong. And, yeah, I got a bonus check for it. Sue me. You know? It\\'s a lot of money. I get it. I can feel you judging me. That\\'s palpable. But, hey, I never said I was the hero of this story. Hey, Ben. How are we looking? Eight on Sorry? No. Eighty million.  million, $ million, that\\'s good, right?  Eighty is great? Is that good?  Eighty is great, Ben? Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. Most of it went to UBS. You\\'re very lucky. The largest bank in France froze customer\\'s money market accounts today. This thing\\'s hitting Europe. Greece and Iceland are finished. Spain is teetering. Are you serious? Fuck. Ben, call us when you get home. But, hey, before you go, I\\'m just wondering Why did you do this with us? You didn\\'t have to. Thank you. But, why? You guys said you wanted to get rich. Now you\\'re rich. Goal! Pamplona puts themselves on the scoreboard. As the housing markets and banks continued to hemorrhage, only one of the big shorts refused to sell. Mark Baum. So it was beyond perfect when he was asked to speak at a conference opposite Bruce Miller, the famous bullish investor. After he and Mark had their debate, Alan Greenspan, one of the architects of the whole crisis was scheduled to speak. Everyone in Mark\\'s office showed up, he even invited friends. This was the Ali vs. Foreman of the financial world. The realist versus the fools. And if it seems almost too perfect, trust me, this happened. Welcome, everyone. Please give a generous welcome to Mr. Bruce Miller and Mark Baum. Strap yourself in. So as some of you may know, Bear Stearns has just received a loan from JP Morgan. Of course, we\\'re gonna have to wait and see how the markets react, but that should lay to rest any concerns about the bank\\'s health. Now, I take it you have no plans to sell your $ million in Bear stock? No. As a matter of fact, when we\\'re done here, I\\'ll probably go out and buy some more. For the opposing view, Mr. Baum. I got to stand for this. Okay, hi. My firm\\'s thesis is pretty simple. Wall Street took a good idea, Lewis Ranieri\\'s mortgage bond, and turned it into an atomic bomb of fraud and stupidity that\\'s on its way to decimating the world economy. How do you really feel? I\\'m glad you still have a sense of humor. I wouldn\\'t if I were you. Now, anyone who knows me knows that I have no problem telling someone they\\'re wrong. Bear Stearns is denying rumors of liquidity problems. Holy fuck, it\\'s  now! We live in an era of fraud in America. Not just in banking, but in government, education, religion, food, even baseball. What bothers me isn\\'t that fraud is not nice or that fraud is mean. It\\'s that for 15, years fraud and short-sighted thinking have never, ever worked.  Jesus, Bear at .Not once. Eventually, people get caught, things go south. It\\'s fucking plummeting, man. When the hell did we forget all that? I thought we were better than this. I really did. And the fact that we\\'re not doesn\\'t make me feel all right and superior. It makes me feel sad. Every time I fucking hit \"refresh\" it\\'s dropping, man. And as fun as it is to watch pompous, dumb Wall Streeters be wildly wrong, and you are wrong, sir, I just know, that at the end of the day average people are going to be the ones that are gonna have to pay for all this. Because they always, always do. It\\'s 32. It\\'s fucking tanked, man. That\\'s my two cents. Thank you. Let me drop a deuce at Deutsche. Does our bull have a response? Only that, in the entire history of Wall Street, no investment bank has ever failed unless caught in criminal activities. So, yes, I stand by my Bear Stearns optimism. Mr. Miller, I\\'m sorry. Quick question. From the time you guys started talking, Bear Stearns stock has fallen more than 38%. Would you still buy more? Yeah, sure, of course I\\'d buy more. Why not? Boom. Jesus Christ! That concludes the first part of our presentation. Up next, we have the legendary former chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan. Folks? .employees of Lehman Brothers today, as the Wall Street giant\\'s stock went to zero. The collapse of the venerable New York bank follows a tumultuous few months of market volatility and fear in the world economy. I got to see inside. How? Come on. I left my phone in the office. I threw my pass out already. Do you mind if I take your pass? I don\\'t give a shit anymore. You can do what you want. Go directly to your transportation. Do not talk to the press. After  years, I just leave? That\\'s just fucking great! I\\'ll talk to whoever the hell I want! Do not talk to the press. Go directly to your transportation. Do not talk to Hey, look, you wanna get a bite tonight? There\\'s this new Cuban place just opened on the Lower East Side. It\\'s supposed to be good.  Really? Yeah. You and I? Yeah, or other people.  That sounds nice. I would like that? Yeah. Finally. Mark, hey. It\\'s a bloodbath up here. Morgan stock has lost half its value. It\\'s down to 23.10. It\\'s in freefall. Clients want to talk to you about pulling their money. It\\'s now or never, Mark. We got to sell. Mark. Mark, you hear me? Mailbox one. You have  messages. Mike, I can\\'t seem to get ahold of you. Will you please call me at your earliest convenience. It\\'s Jack. You\\'re buying stocks? The market\\'s at an all-time low. This is crazy! I met my wife on Match? com. My profile said, \"I am a medical student with only one eye,\" \"an awkward social manner,\" \"and $145, in student loans.\" She wrote back, \"You\\'re just what I\\'ve been looking for.\" She meant honest. So let me be honest. The housing crisis represents the greatest financial opportunity of Making money is not like I thought it would be. This business kills the part of life that is essential. The part that has nothing to do with business. For the past two years, my insides have felt like they\\'re eating themselves. All the people I respected won\\'t talk to me anymore except through lawyers. People want an authority to tell them how to value things .but they choose this authority not based on facts or results. They choose it because it seems authoritative and familiar. And I am not and never have been \"familiar\". So So, I\\'ve come to the sullen realization that I must close down the fund. Sincerely, Michael J. Burry, M? D. This isn\\'t how I pictured it. What did you think we\\'d find? I don\\'t know. Grownups. Mark, you there? Mark? Paulson and Bernanke just left the White House. There\\'s going to be a bailout. Well, they had to. Right? Paper markets would\\'ve collapsed? They knew. Cash would\\'ve stopped coming out of ATMs. They had to backstop this. They knew the taxpayers would bail them out. They weren\\'t being stupid. They just didn\\'t care. Yeah. \\'Cause they\\'re fucking crooks. But at least we\\'re going to see some of them go to jail. Right? I mean, they\\'re gonna have to break up the banks. I mean, the party\\'s over. I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know, Vinnie. I have a feeling that in a few years people are gonna be doing what they always do when the economy tanks. They will be blaming immigrants and poor people. But Mark was wrong. In the years that followed, hundreds of bankers and rating agencies executives went to jail. The SEC was completely overhauled. And Congress had no choice but to break up the big banks and regulate the mortgage and derivatives industries. Just kidding. The banks took the money the American people gave them and used it to pay themselves huge bonuses and lobby Congress to kill big reform. And then they blamed immigrants and poor people. And this time, even teachers. And when all was said and done, only one single banker went to jail. This poor schmuck. Kareem Serageldin from Credit Suisse. He hid a few billion in mortgage bond losses, something most of the big banks did on a good day during the crisis. Mark, can we sell now? The fund will make almost $ billion. You\\'ll clear $ mil, Mark. You know, once we sell, we\\'ll be just like the rest of them. You know that. No, we\\'re not. We\\'re not the bad guys here. We didn\\'t defraud the American people and prey on their dreams of owning a home. All right? They did. And now we get to kick them in the teeth. A billion dollars. That\\'s right. But we got to close out our position or it could be zero. I mean, it\\'s now or never, Mark. Okay. Sell it all.'),\n",

Mr Gekko\\'s office is looking for you. Be at the Wyatt Club courts at six. Come on, sport. You gotta try harder. l need some exercise, for chrissakes.  l don\\'t think l can go on, Mr Gekko? Push yourself. Finish out the game. lt\\'s a very nice club, Mr Gekko. Yeah. Not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way in. Now all these lvy League schmucks are sucking my kneecaps. l just got on the board of the Bronx Zoo. lt cost me a mil. That\\'s the thing you gotta remember about WASPs. They love animals, but they can\\'t stand people. Uh, Mr Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Terafly. About a hundred grand. Well, l guess your dad\\'s not a union representative of that company, huh? How do you know about my father? The most valuable commodity l know of is information. Wouldn\\'t you agree? Yeah. The public\\'s out there throwing darts at a board, sport. l don\\'t throw darts at a board. l bet on sure things. Read Sun Tzu, The Art of War. \"Every battle is won before it\\'s ever fought.\" Think about it. You\\'re not as smart as l thought you were. You ever wonder why fund managers can\\'t beat the S&P 500? Cos they\\'re sheep. And sheep get slaughtered. l\\'ve been in this business since \\'69. Most of these Harvard MBA types don\\'t add up to dogshit. You need guys that are poor, smart and hungry. And no feelings. You win a few, you lose a few, but you keep on fighting. And if you need a friend, get a dog. lt\\'s trench warfare out there, pal.  Hey, Georgie? Hey, Gordon.  How\\'s Larchmont treating you? Fine. How\\'s the Praxar deal going?  You should know, pal? Asshole! And inside here, too. l got  other brokers analysing charts, pal. l don\\'t need another one. See you around, Buddy. l am notjust another broker, Mr Gekko. lf you give me another chance, l\\'ll prove it. l\\'ll go the extra yard for you. Just one more chance, Mr Gekko. Please! Want another chance? Then stop sending me information, and start getting me some. Get dressed. l\\'ll show you my charts.  You know the name? Larry Wildman, one of the first raiders. Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits, thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in. Bribed an old secretary of mine to open her mouth. Stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right from under me. Wildman, the \"White Knight\". l remember that deal. You were involved, Mr Gekko? Payback time, sport. See that building? l bought that building ten years ago. My first real-estate deal. Sold it two years later. Made an $800, profit. lt was better than sex. At the time l thought that was all the money in the world. Now it\\'s a day\\'s pay. Anyway, l had a mole in Wildman\\'s operation.  He gave me half the picture, then got fired? l don\\'t think l follow you. Wildman\\'s in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big is going down, OK? l wanna know where he goes, what he sees. l want you, pal, to fill out the missing picture. Mr Gekko, it\\'s not exactly what l do. l could lose my licence. lf the SEC found out, l could go to jail. That\\'s inside information, isn\\'t it? Like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears l\\'m buying Teldar, and decides he\\'s gonna buy some? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ decides it\\'s time to blow out XYZ? ls that what you mean? Unless your father\\'s on the board of directors of another company, you and l are gonna have a very tough time doing business together.  What about hard work? What about it? You work hard? Bet you stayed up analysing that stock you gave me. Where\\'d it get you? My father worked like an elephant till he dropped dead at  with a heart attack. Wake up, will ya, pal? lf you\\'re not inside, you are outside, OK? l\\'m not talking about some $400, a-year Wall Street stiff, flying first class and being comfortable. l\\'m talking about liquid. Rich enough to have your own jet. Rich enough not to waste time. Fifty, a hundred million dollars, Buddy. A player, or nothing. Now you had what it took to get into my office. The real question is whether you got what it takes to stay. Look at that. You\\'re gonna tell me the difference between this guy and that guy is luck? Mohammed, pull over. lf you don\\'t mind, l\\'m gonna drop you off here. l\\'m late. Buddy, it\\'s been nice meeting you, OK? Buddy taps on window All right, Mr Gekko. You got me. Excuse me, please. Excuse me. l\\'m sorry, sir. Do you have a reservation?  Uh, table for one? Reservations only. We\\'re booked for a week. All right. Don\\'t touch. Everything ready, sir. Excuse me! ls Mr Wildman on board that plane? Shit! My boss is gonna kill me! l\\'m supposed to give him this.  You know where that plane is going? Erie, Pennsylvania. Thank you. After spending the morning at Kahn Seidelman in the junk-bond department, he had lunch at that restaurant, Le Circus, with some well-dressed bean counters. He later stopped off at Morgan. l\\'d say from all the smiling and palm-pressing Larry got himself some nice fat financing, GG. Bright, but not bright enough, Sherlock. Roll the dice and play Monopoly. What box is Sir Larry gonna land on in Erie, Pennsylvania? Jesus Christ! He\\'s buying Anacott Steel. OK. When the market opens tomorrow, l want you to buy  July  calls.  You hear me? Yes, sir. And start buying 1, share blocks and take it up to $50. When it reaches 50, give out a little taste to your friends. Then l want you to call the Wall Street Chronicle, extension 1605. You tell the man \"Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel\".  You got that? The Wall Street Chronicle. Congratulations, Buddy. You scored. l\\'ll talk at ya. Start buying Anacott Steel across the board. Use the offshore accounts. And keep it quiet. Frank, 10, ANC at 46.

Marvin l know what time it is, and this is what l\\'m saying. We have important financial news, Mr Erlich, that just happens to concern your future.  You could benefit What\\'s going on? Anacott Steel. Put your best customers in it. Lou, l got a sure thing. Anacott Steel. No such thing, except death and taxes. Not a good company any more. No fundamentals. What\\'s goin\\' on, Bud? You know something? Remember, there are no short cuts, son. Quick-buck artists come and go with every bull market. The steady players make it through the bear markets. You\\'re a part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don\\'t sell that out. You\\'re right, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can do good things.  You can\\'t get a little bit pregnant, son? Lou, trust me. lt\\'s a winner. Buy it. We\\'ll kamikaze over to Nell\\'s, chase some cotton underwear. l know this  year-old bimbette that\\'s gorgeous. Hold on.  Play tennis Saturday? Can\\'t. Fly-fishing in Canada. Real big client.  Take Anacott? Light snack, but good. Thanks, pal. You\\'re sharking your way up. No, no, my dear, you\\'ve got to diversify. l got a sure thing. Anacott Steel. l\\'ve just heard the most lovely two words. Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel. Anacott Steel. Looks like Anacott Steel\\'s in play. Check the ARBs. Looks like it\\'s being accumulated. Lou? Anacott. l buy. Yeah. Take it and bid it. Quarters won\\'t matter. Keep taking Anacott. This is special. Anacott. Paint the tape.  Bet the ranch? Buy 100, shares.  Wildman is sniffing around? lt\\'s on automatic pilot to the moon.  lf it hits 75, we\\'ll clean  mil. Relax, pal. Don\\'t get emotional about stock. lt clouds the judgment. Which closed at  1/8, up  1/ from yesterday\\'s close on heavy trading. Can l help you? Yes, l\\'m Bud Fox. l have some papers for Mr Gekko to sign.  Come in? Thank you.  l\\'m sorry about this, Mr Gekko? lt\\'s all right. lt\\'s OK. You wanna wait here? Problems? No problem. This is Bud Fox. My wife, Kate.  Hello. You came out from the city? Yes, ma\\'am. Ah, long drive. You want a drink? Yeah, you want a drink? Um sure.  lf you\\'d rather not? No, come on. Have a drink. Get to meet all the people. lt\\'s a good idea. We got Sam Ruspoli, Carmen Winters, Stone Livingston. This is Bud Fox. His illustrious wife, Muffie. Candice Rogers, Dick Brady. Darien Taylor. All old friends. Hi. Great idea, Gordon. l know good help is hard to find, but can it create a dry vodka martini? lt doesn\\'t talk back or steal the silverware. And Dick here is gonna get me an exemption, aren\\'t you? l\\'m in St Kitts with this new Kamali leopard-skin V-cut bikini, which is gonna turn back the clock on my marriage five years. Know what l mean? Call for you, sir. Sir Lawrence Wildman. He says it\\'s important. Thank you, Nyung. Would you fix Mr Livingston another martini? Stick around. This could be fun. lt\\'s all because this Ukrainian bitch botched the job on my wax on my bikini line. How ghastly! Sue her.  Larry, what a surprise!l want to see you, Gordon. Can it wait till tomorrow? l got people here.  No, this can\\'t wait. lt\\'s important? OK. lf you feel that way, come on over. Ah! There you are! Can l steal him for a minute?  Of course? l want your opinion. So what do you see in this? Purity. lnnocence. A few thousand dollars down the tubes, if you ask me. Really? You can kiss your career as an art appraiser goodbye. We paid over 400, for it at the contemporary picture sale last June. Jesus, you could\\'ve had a whole beach house for that! Sure you could. ln Wildwood, New Jersey. lf you sold this one, you could have a nice penthouse on Fifth. You wouldn\\'t have much left over for decoration. lt\\'s nice, if you\\'re on mushrooms. l thought Gordon was a tough businessman. He sure has taken a bath on that. A bath? l\\'d say Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye, and he only buys the best. Like this rug, for instance. A Bokhara. lt\\'s the finest of its kind. After he bought it, a dealer representing the Saudi royal family offered him twice what he paid. lt absolutely makes the room. See how this bit of celadon in the border is picked up by these cushions? Although it\\'s a sacrilege having that Etruscan vase on the table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.  l guess you\\'re a decorator? You got it. A great spender of other people\\'s money. lf you\\'re that good, l\\'m sure you can do wonders with my place.  Where would that be? Upper West Side. Really? Home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant? lt\\'s just a rental. l\\'ll be moving to the East Side soon. Some deals brewing with Gordon. But that\\'s just conversation. What about real things? Like dinner? The two of us next Friday? CafÃ© Santo Domingo. What if l have a previous engagement? You break it. There you go again, Darien. Talking with strange men. Hello. Sam, do you know Bud Fox? Sam is in banking.  Works for Gordon? Nice meeting you.  Are you staying for dinner? No, l have work to do.  Ah. The bell. Excuse me. Call me next week. l\\'ll give you an estimate.  Larry, how have you been? Fine. Travelling, actually.  Can l get you a drink? No, thank you. Larry! Excuse me. Sir Larry. How are ya? Goddamn, you look great!  Gordon? So you wanna talk.  l\\'ll be heading back now, Mr Gekko? Stick around. This is one of my gang. Bud Fox. Shall we go upstairs? Yeah. The rarest pistol in the world, Larry. A . Luger. Only six of \\'em were ever manufactured. Congratulations. Rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel. My interest is the same as yours. Money. Thought it\\'d be a good investment for my kid. No, this time l\\'m in for the long term. lt\\'s not a liquidation. l\\'m gonna turn it around. You\\'re getting a free ride on my tail, mate. With the dollars you\\'re costing me to buy back stock, l could modernise the plant. l\\'m not the only one who pays here, Gordon. We\\'re talking about lives and jobs. Four generations of steelworkers Correct me if l\\'m wrong, but when you got CNX Electronics, you laid off 6, workers. Jemson Fruit, 4,000. That airline you bought, um l could break you, mate. ln two pieces over my knees. You know it. l know it. l could buy you six times over. l could dump the stockjust to burn your arse! But l happen to want the company, and l want your block of shares. l\\'m announcing a tender offer at  tomorrow. l\\'m expecting your commitment. Showdowns bore me, Larry. Nobody wins. You can have the company. ln fact, it\\'ll be fun watching you and your giant ego trying to make a horse race of it. Buddy, what\\'s a fair price for that stock? The break-up value is higher. lt\\'s worth 80. Well, we don\\'t want to be greedy. So what do you say to 72? You\\'re a two-bit pirate and greenmailer. Nothing more, Gekko. Not only would you sell your mother to make a deal, you\\'d send her COD. My mail is the same colour as yours is, pal. Or at least it was until the Queen started calling you \"Sir\". Excuse me before l lose my temper. 371? Considering you brought my mother into it, 71.50. Done. You\\'ll hear from my lawyers tomorrow, am. Good night. He\\'s right, l had to sell. The key to the game is capital reserves. lf you don\\'t have enough, you can\\'t piss in the tall weeds with the big dogs. \"All warfare is based on deception.\" Sun Tzu. \"lf your enemy is superior, evade him.\" \"lf angry, irritate him.\" \"lf equally matched, fight. And if not, split. Re-evaluate.\" He\\'s learning, huh? Buddy\\'s learning! phone ringing  Yeah? Money never sleeps, pal. Just made 800, in Hong Kong gold. lt\\'s been wired to you. Play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. l showed you how the game works. Now school\\'s out. Mr Gekko, l\\'m there for you 110%. No, no, no, no. You don\\'t understand. l wanna be surprised. Astonish me, pal. New info. l don\\'t care where or how you get it. Just get it. My wife tells me you made a move on Darien. Here\\'s some inside info for you. That GQ type she\\'s going out with got big bucks, but he\\'s putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. l don\\'t want you losing your place in line. Ah, Jesus! l wish you could see this. The light\\'s coming up. l\\'ve never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at a moment like this. l\\'m gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. Yeah. Rich enough that you can afford a girl like Darien. This is your wake-up call, pal. Go to work.  Fox!Mr Barnes. Buddy D, is this dÃ©jÃ¢ vu? What\\'s it been? A year, year and a half? So, l hear you\\'re moving up in the world. A senior associate. Not bad. Not bad. How\\'s Margie? l can\\'t complain. l got a house in Oyster Bay, you know. Market treating you good?  Still seeing that sexy French chick? No. No. She asked the wrong question.  What was that?\"What are you thinking?\" The hours are hell, but the cash is starting to tumble in. l know this guy who has an ironclad way of making money. l can\\'t lose or get hurt. Can\\'t get hurt. So does this guy have a tip for an honest lawyer? Maybe. Check out Teldar Paper, but don\\'t quote me. And you? l hear you\\'re handling the Fairchild Foods merger, and it may not go through. Any surprises l haven\\'t read about in the Wall Street Journal? Come on, that\\'s illegal. You wouldn\\'t wanna get me disbarred. Who\\'s listening? Just one college buddy talking to another.  Yeah, right? Oh, relax, Roger. Everybody\\'s doing it now. But, if you don\\'t know, then you don\\'t know. And if l did what\\'s in it for moi? More money than you ever dreamed of. Nobody gets hurt. You think about it.  Let\\'s grab a beer. What do you say? Uh too much to do. But l\\'ll walk you out. The file\\'s on the desk, Marie. Get inside my uncle\\'s door and the secrets of the world are yours. Lifeblood of companies Of course, you gotta go to law school first, but Mr Panos, l\\'ve been charting the growth of office space. You\\'re in the right business at the right time. Thank you for tell me what l already know. Look, l\\'m very impressed with your work, and l could use a tax break. Let me ask, what would you say to some working capital and a partner? Why do l need a partner? Look, you need more vans.  employees can\\'t cover the buildings you got, not to mention the clients we\\'d have together. l am an expert at identifying undervalued assets such as this business. The good news, Gordon, is Rorker Electronics. That\\'s right. l see it happening in the next two months. Come on, their quarterlies are for shit. l got a little gift for you. Gordon will be very pleased. What else have you got? You know Marty Weidman? He netted G off of that merger.  years old, the guy\\'s Rambo.  He\\'s an asshole!He is Rambo! He\\'s got a Porsche Turbo Cabriolet, about  thou. l think if l can make a bundle of cash before l\\'m  and get out of this racket, l\\'ll be able to ride my motorcycle across China. l\\'d like to do for furniture what Laura Ashley did for interior fabrics. Produce a line of high-quality antiques at a low price. Sounds great. l\\'ll take you public. You will? Can l help you? Oh. Excuse me. ls this Bill Bates\\' office? No. l\\'m sorry. Hiya, Dad.  What brings you out here? Client\\'s got a private jet at Butler.  Hey, Buddy. How ya doing? Mr Wall Street! The bozos that keep us in the air!  Give us a hand? Do an honest day\\'s work. All right. Change the oil, fill the tyres and park it out back. This kid wanna buy the plane?  You always light up when you see me? Don\\'t start, all right? All right. So who peed in your Cheerios? Goddamn fare wars are killing us! Management\\'s gonna lay off five of my men this week. l\\'m sorry about that.  So how much you need? l don\\'t need anything. l\\'m doing great. New client, new ball game. Things are starting to happen. Sure. Lots of guys at the track talk like that. How do you know you\\'ll have any dough next month? Jesus Christ, what is this? lt\\'s a dividend. l\\'ve borrowed at least five grand over the years. Oh, stop it. Put this towards your school loan. Forget the loans. Look, Dad, things are good and it\\'s gonna stay that way.  Buy yourself a new suit? What do l need a suit for? l don\\'t hobnob with the jet set. l just fix their planes. Then get a decent bowling jacket, so you don\\'t look like the Roto-Rooter man. Come on, what\\'s money for? Enjoy yourself. Money is a pain in the ass, if you ask me. But thanks, kid.  How about dinner? Sure. Any night this week. OK. No, l\\'m sorry. This week\\'s booked.  l\\'ll check with my girl. l\\'ll get back to you? You do that, Huckleberry. l gotta run. You stop smoking, you hear? l\\'ll talk at ya. Whoo! Oh! Darien shrieks man lt\\'s in both our interests to put a safe distance between you and us.  You understand that, Mr Fox? Sure. This gives you limited power of attorney for Mr Gekko\\'s account. Every ticket you buy must be marked \"power of attorney\". That means that you call the shots. Mr Gekko has no official knowledge of what stocks you\\'re buying. All right? Just sign it at the end, twice. l never knew how poor l was until l started making money. Your transactions will be monitored by StockWatch. lf any trouble does arise, you are on your own out there. The trail stops with you, understand? Spread the buy orders over different accounts, you won\\'t get burnt. l have friends that won\\'t mind making easy money.  Rudy Gazoodi! How\\'s my cutie?! Viens ici! man We need more votes for the showdown, but don\\'t wanna go public  Bonjour, Monsieur Buddy? Bonjour, Monsieur Buddy. Oh! He speaks French already. Kid had the highest score in his lQ test. lt is so difficult to get into a good nursery school now. They even go to your home to make sure you\\'re acceptable. That\\'s it for you with the grown-ups.  Nicole, would you take him for a nap now? Viens, mon petit. Give him a bath and put that cute little black suit on him. This is a contact at one of our offshore banks. On settlement day you\\'ll open an account for Mr Gekko under the name Geneva Roth Holding Corp. Then you\\'ll wire-transfer the money to this account in the Cayman lslands. You\\'re gonna make a lot of money, pal. The stakes are going up. No mistakes. Piece of cake, Gordon. lf l could have anything, this would almost do. Almost. How\\'d your conference go with Gordon? lt went fine. We reached an agreement, and decided to split up the world between us. Darien laughs You have modest wants. l like that in a man.  What do you want? Let\\'s see. A Turner. A perfect canary diamond. World peace. The best of everything. Well, why stop at that? l don\\'t. My client wants to buy a large block of Teldar. He needs to spread it around. l\\'ll park some money in your account. lf it hits, you get a big cut. l\\'m telling you, this is the easiest money you\\'ve ever made. All right, Bud. Let\\'s do it. We go way back, Harry. You know, l-l-l\\'ve put a lot of money into this firm over the years.  l brought in a lot of business? You\\'ve taken enough out, too.  You should have something put aside? With the divorces l haven\\'t had a chance.  The bridges are burned? When you fire me l\\'m finished. On the street.  How do you think l feel about this? How do you think l feel? l\\'ve got responsibilities. l\\'ve got two kids What\\'s going on? Lynch is giving him the boot. Not pulling his quota. We\\'re all one trade away from humility. New report on GM and a conference call in defence stock in my office,  am tomorrow. No RSVP required. Just be there. Now, on a more inspiring note, the new office record for a single month\\'s gross commission from the wealthy individual accounts goes to Bud Fox. Shows cold calling does work, fellas. Way to go, Bud. Superjob. Come on up here. Bud, congrats. You just made my life twice as hard around here. You\\'re on a roll, kid. Enjoy it while it lasts, cos it never does. Just kicking ass and taking names, Lou. Come along with me, Bud. This is yours now, Bud. Credenza. Tree. Windows. And, significantly more attractive, your private secretary Janet.  Nice to meet you, Mr Fox? Hello, Janet. Well, l don\\'t really know what to say. Thank you, Mr Lynch. No, l thank you, Bud. The minute l laid my eyes on you l knew that you had what it takes. Now you can focus on the big-ticket retail. Oh, this is very nice. This is very nice. So what is it? Mr Cocksucker now? Everybody hates the Upper East Side. They wanna live on the West Side. But when it\\'s resale time the East Side moves all the time. What have you got on the West Side? Sean and Madonna?! Trust me. Massage, sauna, Jacuzzi tanning salon. Best schools in the city. A cute young boy like you gotta think of a future lady friend in your life when you\\'ve finished wolfing around. Course, l\\'m taken. Oak strip floors. My husband can get you a 10% mortgage. l would do it myself, except l\\'m into four other deals right now. So, l got a four o\\'clock and a five. One\\'s an all-cash type. Monique something or other. Look, maybe you\\'d like to see something cheaper that l got on First Avenue? Honey, the meter\\'s running. Anybody home? All right. Offer 950. l got something over on Sutton Place. lt\\'s a million and a half, but now we\\'re talking duplex. No. This is it. This is home. \"This Must Be the Place\" by Talking Heads That\\'s enough gold over there. Like it? l\\'m having House & Garden come up next week to photograph it before it gets lived in. Do you mind? Hey! Jerry! Come at me. Whaddaya got? No, no.  1/2. Convert the bonds and check the price in Tokyo at eight o\\'clock your time. Right. l\\'m spilling everything. aria from \"Rigoletto\"playing on stereo Bud tries to sing along in mock ltalian lsn\\'t it perfect? lt\\'s too perfect. Let\\'s not even eat. Let\\'s just watch it think about it. Who am l? Bud, come to bed. One million six. Seven. On my left now. Against you, 1,800,000. 71,900,000. New bidder this side. $m here now. Not yours. At $2,100,000. $2,100,000. Fair warning, then. Selling for $2,100,000. All done. For you, sir. $2,100,000. Whaddaya say we get a suite at the Carlyle? Champagne, caviar? Celebrate just like old times? Come on, Gordon. Those days are over. Well, you can\\'t blame me for trying. You\\'re as beautiful as that painting l just bought. Sunshine, what\\'s wrong? l think you got a bad case of puppy love. l think l\\'m falling for Bud. Don\\'t fall too far. He hasn\\'t been around the block yet. You have.  Told him about us? No! Are you crazy?  l don\\'t want him to ever know, understand? Mum is the word. You and l are the same, Darien. We are smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth runninglove. Fiction created by people to keep them from jumping out of windows. You know, sometimes l miss you, Gordon. You\\'re really twisted. For chrissake, Jack, it\\'s easy! On settlement day you endorse a cheque to Blue Horseshoe Trading Company. Then l\\'ll send you your cut. What? No, that\\'s the bottom line. Nobody gets hurt. What the fuck is wrong with you? lt\\'s so bad, even the liars are complaining. But not you. You\\'re making big money.  What\\'s the bottom line? Hey, look! l am sick and tired of playing wet nurse to you!  Will you do your own homework, Marv!What an asshole, man! That\\'s a shame. Yeah, Frank. Work 500, shares Teldar with a limit of 26. New account. Don\\'t fuck it up.  How\\'s Teldar doing? Back again?  l\\'ve got a real appetite? Bring it five to a half. 2, up.  l gotta buy stock. What\\'s offered at a half? What are we looking at?  Make me an offer on 80.80, at a half. l\\'ll take it. Your company, ladies and gentlemen, is under siege from Gordon Gekko. Teldar Paper is now leveraged to the hilt, like some piss-poor South American country! l strongly recommend you to see through Mr Gekko\\'s shameless intention here to strip this company, and severely penalise the stockholders. l strongly recommend you to reject his tender by voting for management\\'s restructuring of the stock. Well, l appreciate the opportunity you\\'re giving me, Mr Cromwell, as the single largest shareholder in Teldar Paper, to speak. laughter We are not here to indulge in fantasy, but in political and economic reality. America America has become a second-rate power. lts trade deficit and its fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions. ln the days of the free market, when our country was a top industrial power, there was accountability to the stockholder. The Carnegies, the Mellons, the men that built this great empire, made sure of it because it was their money at stake. Today, management has no stake in the company! All together, these men sitting up here own less than 3% of the company. And where does Mr Cromwell put his $1,000, salary? Not in Teldar stock. He owns less than 1%. You own the company. That\\'s right, you, the stockholder. And you are all being royally screwed over by these bureaucrats, with their steak lunches, their fishing trips, their corporate jets and golden parachutes. This is an outrage! You\\'re out of line, Gekko! Teldar Paper, Mr Cromwell, has  different vice presidents, each earning over $200, a year. Now, l have spent the last two months analysing what all these guys do.  And l still can\\'t figure it out. One thing l do know is that our paper company lost $m last year. And l\\'ll bet half of that was spent in all the paperwork between all these vice presidents! The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be survival of the unfittest. Well, in my book you either do it right, or you get eliminated. ln the last seven deals that l have been involved with there were 2.m stockholders who have made a pre-tax profit of $ billion. applause Thank you. l am not a destroyer of companies. l am a liberator of them! The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its formsgreed for life, for money, for love, knowledgehas marked the upward surge of mankind. And greed, you mark my words, will not only save Teldar Paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA. Thank you very much. Fly me to the moon Let me play among the stars Buy me  June eurodollar CDs,  March gold and sell  September Deutschmarks. Right. Talk at ya, babe. Ah, Buddy, Buddy, l hate to tell you this, but you are a genius! Darien! Lightning has struck. The light bulb has been invented. Bluestar Airlines. Edison, da Vinci, Einstein. They\\'re all watching me. Ever hear of the  hour work week? You\\'ve gotta go to work soon. l\\'m getting psychotic from a lack of REM sleep. l\\'m not gonna broker the rest of my life. l am gonna be a giant, an entrepreneur in the ltalian th-century sense of the word. A mover, a shaker. l\\'m shooting for the stars, Darien. You\\'re coming along for the ride. Bluestar is an unpolished gem, Gordon. A half-assed management being decimated by a price war they cannot win. But the gates at La Guardia alone can bail us out. lf it\\'s worth a dime, it\\'s worth  bucks a share. They\\'re ripe to fall! Mixed emotions, Buddy. Like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati! Guys like me have had their asses hung in a sling with the airlines!  Fuel could go up. Unions are killers? Yeah, but aren\\'t you forgetting one thing? Capital reserves. This company has  million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility. And the beauty is, you already own close to 2% of this sucker. The insurance people are balking on the logging trucks. What do you want to do? Tell those assholes we\\'ll self-insure if they don\\'t write it. l can\\'t believe we can fire half the management and nothing changes! deep sigh Gordon, what l want, and l\\'ve never asked you for anything, is to be your copilot on this one. l wanna take this airline, turn it around and make it work. lt\\'s gonna make us a fortune. l got a stockbroker who wants an airline. lt\\'ll take two years to turn Teldar Paper around. What do l need a dink airline for? l\\'m up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake! l\\'ve worked at Bluestar. l know my way around. l have friends there, inside. What do you mean? The three unions. lt\\'s 43% of Bluestar\\'s operating budget. The hourly cost of a flight crew is  an hour. That\\'s the real hidden value, GG. lf you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to 350,  an hour, this airline\\'ll be the hottest thing since Texas Air.  What makes you think you can? l can talk to these people. They trust me. My father can be a big help in getting cuts. All right. Susan, get Buckingham on the phone. Tell him to look into it. So the falcon\\'s heard the falconer, huh?  Hi, Dad? Sorry l\\'m late. That\\'s OK. Overdressed as usual. Come on in. Everybody\\'s here. l couldn\\'t start the show without you. Well, l\\'ll be a lousy Republican! l decorate for Democrats, too. Lots of them. l\\'m Darien Taylor.  Bud\\'s told me all about you? Don\\'t believe a word. l never beat him or locked him in a closet.  l forgot about the closet? He turned out OK. Bud\\'s a born liar, otherwise he\\'s a good kid. l hope you come here more often, under less formal circumstances. Thank you.  Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore? Sure. How are ya? Pilots\\' union. Toni Carpenter, flight attendants\\'. l\\'d like you to meet Mr Gekko. Mr Fox, pleasure to meet you. His attorney, Mr Salt. l\\'d be proud to have a son like Buddy. Got a hell of a career in front of him. l\\'m glad you think so. l thought this was informal. What\\'s your attorney doing here? Harold, you don\\'t mind walking around the block, do you?  Of course? l\\'ll take that. No offence. None taken. That\\'s OK, Gordon. Bud does it all the time. Gekko Look, l got no illusions about winning a popularity contest with any of you. l got roasted the other night. A friend asked \"Why are we honouring this man? Did we run out of human beings?\" lt\\'s not always the most popular guy who gets the job done. You\\'ve got losses of $  million, dividends cut to zero, and you\\'re being squeezed to death by the majors. The management may not be the worst scum, but they put you on this kamikaze course, and pretty soon everybody is gonna be scrambling for parachutes. Only there\\'s not enough to go around. Management has them. You don\\'t. lf they throw Bluestar to Chapter 11, which l think they will, they\\'ll use the bankruptcy laws to break your unions, and throw you off the property. Oh, come on! With all due respect, what\\'s to prevent you from doing the same thing? Cos l got a way around all this, where we can all make money and make the airline profitable. So what do you say we cut to the chase? l\\'m asking for a modest 20% across-the-board wage cut, and seven more hours a month. What kind of time frame? A year. lf we\\'re still losing money, the reduction stands. lf we\\'re in the black, l\\'ll return part of the givebacks, pay goes back to current levels, and we initiate an employee profit-sharing programme with stock.  You\\'ll own part of the airline? Will you put it in writing? l\\'ll have a letter of agreement drafted up in two days. What\\'s your marketing strategy? How will you return us to profitability? Why don\\'t l give Buddy an opportunity to answer that? Buddy? Thank you, Gordon. First, l want you all to know that my door will always be open, because l know from my dad it\\'s you guys that keep Bluestar flying. What l\\'ve come up with here is a basic three-point plan. One: we modernise. Our computer software is dogshit. We update it. We squeeze every dollar out of each mile flown. Don\\'t sell a seat to a guy for  bucks when he\\'s willing to pay 379. Effective inventory management will increase our load factor by 20%. That translates to approximately $  million in revenues. The point being, we can beat the majors at a price war. Two: advertising. More, and aggressive. We attack the majors. Three: expansion. We expand our hubs to Atlanta, North Carolina and St Louis. And we reorganise all of our feeder schedules. We gotta think big, guys. We\\'re going after the majors. Well, cards on the table, guys. What do you say? Well, if you mean what you say, l think we\\'re probably in the ballpark.  l guess l can take it to my people? Good. You\\'ve sketched broad strokes. l\\'d like to see the fine print. But l like what l hear so far. Carl laughs l guess if a man lives long enough he gets to see everything, and l do mean everything. What else you got in your bag of tricks, Mr Gekko? Frankly, Carl, l can\\'t see giving much more, but, if you have any suggestions, l\\'ll listen. \"There came into Egypt a Pharaoh who did not know.\"  l beg your pardon. ls that a proverb? No, a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since time began. The only difference is the Egyptians didn\\'t allow unions. l know what this guy\\'s all aboutgreed. He don\\'t care about Bluestar or the unions. He\\'s in for the buck. He don\\'t take prisoners. Wait a minute, Dad. Sure. What\\'s worth doing is worth doing for money. lt\\'s a bad bargain if nobody gains. And if we do this deal, everybody gains. Course, my son worked as a baggage handler and freight loader for three summers. With those qualifications, he can run an airline! Fine. Stay with the present management dedicated to running you and your airline into the ground. That \"scum\" built the company up with one plane and made something out of nothing. lf that\\'s a scum, l\\'ll take it over a rat any day. You know where l stand. Good night, all. Excuse me. Congratulations, Dad! You did a greatjob embarrassing me, not to mention yourself! Save the \"workers unite\" speech. l heard it too much growing up!  Oh, yeah? You\\'ll get axed. No two ways about it. You and the whole shitty airline are going down the tubes! And if it isn\\'t Gekko, it\\'s gonna be some other killer! He\\'s using you, kid. He\\'s got your prick in his pocket, but you\\'re too blind to see it. No. l see ajealous old machinist who can\\'t stand the fact that his son\\'s more successful than he is! What you see is a guy who never measured a man\\'s success by the size of his wallet! That\\'s because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your own claim! Boy, if that\\'s the way you feel, l must\\'ve done a really lousy job as a father. As far as being axed, l\\'m still around, and l have a responsibility to the union membership l represent. Your responsibility is to present the facts, not opinions, to your men. You\\'ll destroy their lives. Let them decide for themselves. My men will want to know what\\'s going on, and l won\\'t lie to them! Oh, yeah, your men! Your fuckin\\' men! All my life your men have been able to count on you! Why have you never been there for me?! What if you\\'re wrong? What if one day the sun didn\\'t rise in the east, and for once your compass was off? Would you be willing to wreck your men\\'s future? My future? Dad, think for a change. Be practical. l\\'m asking you. l\\'m fuckin\\' begging you! l don\\'t go to sleep with no whore and l don\\'t wake up with no whore. That\\'s how l live with myself. l don\\'t know how you do it. l hope l\\'m wrong about this guy but l\\'ll let the men decide for themselves. That much l promise you. You should look at this, Chief. A guy at Jackson Steinem buying large chunks of Teldar Paper for an offshore account. knock at door So, what\\'s the problema?  Do you know what the fuck the problem is? What?  You don\\'t know? l don\\'t know. l get a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records.  This is heavy, Bud? Hey, hey, hey, relax! Relax, Roger. You\\'re M in the account numbers and l\\'m the invisible man. Well, that\\'s good for you, Bud. They\\'re always looking for red flags. Gekko\\'s always getting checked by \\'em. They never come up with anything, Rog. Hey we\\'re invulnerable on this one. l just wanna slow down, Bud. All right? No more lunches, no calls, all right? We suspend our business, all right? Whatever you want, Rog. lt\\'s cool. Excuse me. Hey, Rog, can you come back in? Bring the cost report. We\\'re starting again. Gekko\\'s asked us into the Bluestar deal. We\\'re reviewing timetables.  You wanna come? He didn\\'t tell me about that. You\\'re only the president of the company. What the hell do you know anyway, right? Guys, new chief of BluestarBud Fox.  Hi? Hello, Bud. Guys, what\\'s the problem? lt\\'s time to kill. Gekko\\'s got 12% of the stock and climbing. Plus he\\'s got the unions in his back pocket. Everybody knows the stock\\'s in play. By next week the street will own Bluestar. ls the bank financing in place? Or are we gonna sit around and have more of these ridiculous meetings? Our firm committed weeks ago 25% of the total long-term debt structure. Unless you guys sign this piece of paper right now, l\\'m gonna pull and go to another bank for the 75. Look, we\\'ve got  banks ready to participate in a four-year revolving credit line. We must have your assurance you will pay back most of the loan in the first  months. The only way we can see this happening is liquidating the hangars and the planes. Can you people guarantee the liquidation of Bluestar? Guarantee? No sweat! We got the Bleezburgs lined up to build condos where the hangars are. We lay the airplanes off to the Mexicans, who are dumb enough to buy \\'em! And l got the Texas boys drooling at my kneecaps for the routes and slots. What\\'s your problem? lt\\'s done! Here\\'s the price tags on the s, gates, hangars, routes. We got it nailed right down to the typewriters. The beauty of this deal is the overfunded pension. Gekko makes $m there.  million buys him the minimum annuities for 6, employees, and he walks away with the rest. l figure he\\'ll make He\\'ll clear $ m. Not bad for a month\\'s work. Your boy really did his homework, Fox. And you\\'ll have the shortest executive career since that Pope that got poisoned. Now he\\'ll really start believing he\\'s Gekko the Great.  He\\'d like to change that appointment? Hold this. Bud, you can\\'t go in! He\\'s in a meeting! Alex has come up with an ingenious way for us to l didn\\'t know we had a meeting today, sport. l didn\\'t, either. l think we should talk, Gordon.  Would you excuse us for a second? Won\\'t you come this way, gentlemen? Thank you, Alex. What do you want? l just found out about the garage sale at Bluestar. Why?! Last night l was reading Rudy Winnie-the-Pooh and the Honey Pot. You know what happened? He stuck his nose in the pot once too often, and he got stuck. Maybe you oughta read him Pinocchio. l thought you were gonna turn Bluestar around, not upside down!  You fuckin\\' used me!You\\'re walking around blind without a cane. A fool and his money are lucky to even meet.  Why do you need to wreck this company? Because it\\'s wreckable, all right?! l took another look. l changed my mind. lf they lose theirjobs, they got nowhere to go! My father has worked there for  years! l gave him my word! lt\\'s all about bucks, kid. The rest is conversation. Buddy, you\\'ll still be president. When the time comes, you\\'ll parachute out a rich man. With the money you\\'ll make, your dad\\'s never got to work again. So tell me, Gordon, when does it all end, huh? How many yachts can you water-ski behind? How much is enough? lt\\'s not a question of enough, pal. lt\\'s a zero-sum game. Somebody wins, somebody loses. Money itself isn\\'t lost or made, it\\'s simply transferred from one perception to another, like magic. This painting here. l bought it ten years ago for $60,000. l could sell it today for six hundred. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperate they want it. Capitalism at its finest. How much is enough, Gordon? The richest 1% of this country owns half our country\\'s wealth. Five trillion dollars. One third comes from hard work, two thirds from inheritance, interest on interest accumulating to widows and idiot sons, and what l do: stock and real-estate speculation. lt\\'s bullshit. You got 90% of the American public with little or no net worth. l create nothing. l own. We make the rules, pal. The news, war, peace, famine, upheaval, the price of a paperclip. We pick that rabbit out of the hat while everybody wonders how the hell we did it. You\\'re not naive enough to think we\\'re living in a democracy, are you, Buddy? lt\\'s the free market, and you\\'re part of it. Yeah. You got that killer instinct. Stick around, pal. l still got a lot to teach you. Obviously. Oh, Buddy, come on. l was gonna tell you about it. Calm down, all right? We\\'ll have dinner tonight. Bring Darien. No, l can\\'t make it tonight. Hey, Buddy. Are you with me? l need to know if you\\'re with me. l\\'m with you, Gordon.  Natalie, l\\'ll be right there? Yes, Mr Gekko.  Yeah? Yeah, Ollie. Tell them l want ziplocked mouths on the Bluestar deal, or l\\'ll come down there and rip out their fuckin\\' throats. Bud? What\\'s going on? l\\'ve been played like a grand piano by the master, Gekko the Great. Today was the big crash, the liquidation sale. He\\'s gonna carve Bluestar into little pieces and sell it all off. Bastard! l\\'m sorry. l was afraid something like this could happen. l handed it to him on a silver platter. l told my father Bud! Bud, it\\'s not your fault. And it\\'s not your decision. l\\'m not gonna let it happen. Don\\'t cross Gordon. He\\'ll crush you. lf Gordon doesn\\'t buy Bluestar, someone else will. Who\\'s to say they won\\'t do the same? At least l won\\'t be pulling the trigger. Why are you doing this? You\\'ve worked hard to get where you are. We\\'re so close. You don\\'t wanna throw it all away. Look, l can stay with the firm, and you\\'re doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko. l\\'m not looking to just survive. l\\'ve been doing that all my life. Cut this self-pity crap, Bud! What the hell\\'s that supposed to mean? lt means if you make an enemy of Gordon Gekko, l can\\'t be there to stand by you. Oh, yeah? Do you really mean that? What did he promise you? To take you public? Without his money and seal of approval l\\'m not such a hot investment any more.  You\\'re just the best money can buy, Darien? You\\'re not exactly pure, Bud. You went after Gekko and me with the same vengeance. Look in the mirror. l\\'m looking, and l sure don\\'t like what l see. Fair enough. But it\\'s not that simple, Bud. When l was down and had nothing, it was Gordon who helped me. He got me all my clientsyou among themand he can take them away from me like that. You may find out that when you\\'ve had money and lost it,  ..it\\'s worse than never having had it at all? Oh, yeah? That is bullshit! Hey! Hey! You step out that door and l am changing the locks! You may not believe this, Bud, but l really do care for you. We would\\'ve made a good team. l\\'m sorry. Get the fuck outta here! The market is dead right now. Even the rich are bitching. The only thing moving is the termites and cockroaches, and my commission Look, save the rap, all right? Just sell the fucker, fast! There he is. Where you been the last two days?  Janet, get my father on the phone andYour mom\\'s been calling. Your father\\'s  What happened? He had a heart attack, but he\\'s OK.  He\\'s at St John\\'s? Oh, Christ! Mom? How is he? He was complaining about chest pains at work. The next thing l know he\\'s collapsed. You gotta talk to him. Don\\'t worry, he\\'s a tough old nut. He\\'s got another  years.  He\\'s gonna be fine, Buddy? ls he conscious? Hiya, Dad. You\\'re looking younger every day. Didn\\'t l tell you never to lift a  by yourself? You even got me smoking now. lt\\'s your second heart attack, Dad. You\\'re pushing your luck. l hope you know that. l guess l never told you, but l love you, Dad. l love you so much! l\\'m sorry about the things l said. You\\'re the only honest man l know. The best. l got a plan, Dad. l can save the airline. l know you got no reason to believe me, but you have to trust me, OK? l need to speak to the union members. Can l speak for you? Your words, not mine. OK. l gotta go. l\\'m proud of you. The stock\\'s at  1/4, and it\\'s going up. Gekko figures, by breaking up Bluestar, it\\'s  bucks a share. He\\'ll buy up to  and still think he\\'s making money. How do you know it\\'ll go up? You don\\'t wanna know, Duncan. Let\\'s just say l have some friends. OK. What happens now? When it hits 23, you go to Gekko and lower the boom. When he learns he has no union concessions, he\\'ll jump ship. Yeah, but who\\'ll buy then, and what\\'s to prevent some other shark devouring us? We have an appointment to see Mr Wildman. Sir Lawrence, or can l call you Larry? What would you say to owning Bluestar Airlines, with union concessions, at $ a share, and, in the process, hanging Gordon Gekko out in the wind to twist? l might be very interested. Why you, mate? What\\'s a bloke like you doing mixed up with Gekko? Let\\'s just say that me and Mr Gekko have a serious conflict of interest. But we all wanna see this airline work. These figures show that it can. You\\'re prepared to take these large salary cuts? We are, but we want a contract agreement that\\'s ironclad. So if you buy it, you can\\'t break it up. l\\'m still listening. Hi. Oh, hi. Say, why don\\'t you get the hell out of my office? l know l\\'ve been a schmuck lately. l want to apologise. You\\'ve been a real schmuck lately. So go thou and sin no more. l wanna make it up to you. Bluestar. Put all your clients in it. OK, Buddy-Buddy. We are back in business on Bluestar. Bluestar, Mr Mannheim. Put all your clients in it. lt\\'s gonna move. l don\\'t know where you get your information, son, but l don\\'t like it. The main thing about money, Bud it makes you do things you don\\'t wanna do. Marty, a favour. 200, shares Bluestar at  1/2. Can you position it in an equity fund?  The Chronicle is on seven? Hold, Marty. Listen, Blue Horseshoe loves Bluestar Airlines. Got it?  Got it? Right. Marty, you still there? Bluestar\\'s in play. Let\\'s check it out. traders shouting   1/4,  1/2. 5,000. 1/ at 10,000. l do love it so. Gordon, l see it at  1/2. l don\\'t know what to make of it. The word is out, pal! Your union buddies are talking. You get me in at a  degree angle. All the way in. You slash and burn, you buy everything in sight up to 22, then call me. When l get hold of whoever leaked this, l\\'ll tear his eyes out and suck his fuckin\\' skull!  Stock\\'s going to Pluto? Start unloading.  What? Sell? Dump it! Now! Dump it all!  Where\\'s Lou? Right over there. Ken? Marvin. Jackson Steinem. Dump this baby. Take the money and run. We\\'re getting out. lt\\'s gotta be a big hitter. There\\'s some people from Bluestar demanding to see you.  What the hell do they want? l\\'d be happy to tell you. We know what you\\'re up to, Gekko, and you can go straight to hell! No way you\\'re gonna break up our airline.  lf that\\'s my plan, it\\'s the first l\\'ve heard of it? Would you put that in writing? We have an agreement, which l expect you to honour.  Then you better have a pilot\\'s licence? Don\\'t worry, the engines won\\'t fall out. But those reservations can get screwed up if we don\\'t pay attention. Baggage for St Petersburg could wind up in Pittsburgh. Look, somebody else wants to buy your airline. You wanna be gobbled up by Attila the Hun, you be my guest! We\\'ll take our chances. Nice to see you, Gekko! Fox says Bluestarjust hit 23. What do you want him to do? Sell it all.  What the hell. So we only make  million? Sell it. Yes, all of it. 3710, at  1/2! At  1/2, sold! Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, for chrissake! Goddamn connection! Bob, we\\'re in big trouble on BST. You gotta get out now. Another 30,000. Out! Gekko\\'s selling. There\\'s not many takers. The stock is plummeting. l guess l\\'ll have to carry him a few rounds before he drops. Don\\'t make a big deal of it. Buy it lightly on the way down. When it hits 18, buy it all. Piece of cake, Larry. traders shouting 388, at 18. What is offered at 18? 38300,. 300, at 18!  for 500,000! traders Sold!  l\\'ll sell you 50!l\\'ll take it!  There\\'s gotta be a way outta this? Sure. Why don\\'t you dial 911? Fox is on four. Where the hell are you? l am losing millions. You sure as hell better get me out of this, or the only job you\\'ll have on this street is sweeping it! You once told me, don\\'t get emotional about stock, Gordon. Don\\'t. The bid is  1/ and going down. As your broker, l advise you to take it. Yeah? Well, you take it! Right in the ass, you fuckin\\' scumbag cocksucker! lt\\'s two minutes to close, Gordon. What do you wanna do? Decide. Dump it. The big Wall Street story today was Bluestar Airlines. Fuelled by takeover rumours, the stock soared to an all-time high of  1/8. When rumours later surfaced that the takeover was unfounded, buyers ran for cover and the stock plummeted to  1/ before closing at 17. Then, amidst all the scuttlebutt, another rumble shook the street. Raider Sir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in and bought a substantial block of Bluestar, and will announce a deal tomorrow that includes the support of the unions. We talked with a leading stock market analyst, in order to understand the ramifications Son of a bitch! Smile, Carolyn. There\\'s justice in the world. Good morning, folks. Did somebody die? Yeah. Morning, Chuckie. Morning, Lou. Bud Bud, l like you. Just remember something. Man looks in the abyss. There\\'s nothing staring back at him. At that moment, man finds his character. And that is what keeps him out of the abyss. l think l understand. Janet, get my father, will you? He just came in. l\\'ll call you back. l guess you\\'re not here to open an lRA. Henry Patterson, Postal lnspection Service. Mr Ebenhopper, US Attorney\\'s office. Evan Morrissey, Securities and Exchange Enforcement office. You\\'re under arrest for conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and for violating the lnsider Traders Sanction Act. The minute l laid eyes on you, l knew you were no good. You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions. Anything you do say may be used against you. You have the right to consult an attorney and to have an attorney present during any questioning. So long, Carolyn. Hiya, Buddy. Gordon. Sandbagged me on Bluestar, huh? l guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that the tail can wag the dog, huh? Well, let me clue you in, pal. The ice is melting right underneath your feet. You think you could have gotten this far this fast with anybody else? And dickin\\' someone like Darien? No. You\\'d be cold-calling widows and dentists to buy fuckin\\' dogshit stock! l took you in! A nobody! l opened doors for you. l showed you how the system works, the value of information, how to get it! Fulham Oil, Brant Resources, Geodynamics! And this is how you fuckin\\' pay me back, you cockroach! l gave you Darien! l gave you your manhood! l gave you everything! You coulda been one of the great ones, Buddy. l look at you and l see myself. Why? l don\\'t know. l guess l realised that l\\'m just Bud Fox. As much as l wanted to be Gordon Gekko l\\'ll always be Bud Fox. tape l showed you how the system works, the value of information, how to get it! Fulham Oil, Brant Resources You did the right thing, Bud. Carl You told the truth and gave the money back. All things considered in this cockamamie world, you\\'re shooting par. You helped save the airline, and they\\'ll remember you for it. That\\'s right. Think about the job at Bluestar that Wildman offered you. Dad, l\\'m going to jail and you know it. Yeah, well maybe that\\'s the price, son. lt\\'s gonna be hard on you, but maybe in a kind of screwed-up way it\\'s the best thing that coulda happened to you. Stop going for the easy buck and produce something with your life. Create, instead of living off the buying and selling of others. We\\'ll park the car and catch up with you. All right.

Time and time again, the competition for this limited amount of dollars out there can make the best of us manic. So it\\'s not surprising that we have these asset bubbles, but when reality sets in, of course they burst. economic growth here at home and geopolitical turmoil weighed on the broad averages. Commodities continue - the historic run-up in price? Here you go. Take a look at the dramatic move in copper prices, for example, as that once-quiet market has become a hotbed of activity. You\\'re disappointed. Quants? Derivative structures? I mean, what was that about? It makes no sense. That\\'s what you said last time. Why\\'d we go down there? - To sign? To sign. - Did we sign? No. No. We did not. Instead, I flew 2, miles for a marketing meeting. Where was Mayfield? What was this emergency? What was that about? You speak to the auditors? Why?

Just follow the plan.  And what is that plan? Confidence equals contract.  You sound like a fortune cookie? They are your words, actually.  Then you married an idiot?

Enjoy your dinner? Thank you.  Where the hell is Mayfield? I don\\'t know.  Mr. Miller. Thank you so much for coming? Hello. No, no, no, no.  Good to see you again? Yeah, yeah. We were just getting acquainted with Peter and Brooke here.  I hope they didn\\'t beat you up too much? No, no. They\\'ve been terrific. Dad, we\\'ve been talking about operations. Tim thinks once we consolidate, we can save about 0% on our back office costs. Yeah, I\\'d like to hear more about that, but, eh, I had thought that Mr. Mayfield planned to meet us here tonight. Yeah, Jim should be here in about  minutes. He suggested that we get right into details. I was just saying to Brooke, now that we can market your quants track records, we have access to a host of new capital. And we\\'ve got something very special, something we\\'re thrilled about. New capital is exciting. That\\'s why we\\'re here? Talk to us a bit about oversight. I mean, obviously we\\'ve been very successful at what we do because We hope that it spreads across oh, thank you. Assuming we shed debt through some small liquidations, we\\'re looking at a significant uptake in ROI. I don\\'t want to pin a number on it, but they significant in the first quarter alone. I\\'m sorry, gentlemen. We\\'ve been here almost two hours now. Where is Mr. Mayfield? He just texted me. He\\'s very sorry, but he\\'s been detained. Detained? Where? All right. I think I can trust you with my family.  Oh, yeah? Of course. Mr. Miller, again, it was a privilege.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah? Dad, Dad? Excuse me. This is the bullshit way you try to close a deal? Port. Would you like some to have some port?  Dad. Did you get my message? Yeah?  No, what\\'s up? We need to sit down. What is it?  I can\\'t talk about it here? Brooke, I I found some strange entries in the Old Hill books.  What kind of entries? I don\\'t know yet, but something is definitely off. All right, all right. Come by around 11: tomorrow. We\\'ll look at it then. Okay? And, Brooke? See if you can find out what happened with Mayfield. All right? Excuse me. Thanks.  Good evening, Mr. Miller? Hey.  So how are they doing? Great. Everyone loves them.  How are they doing? So-so.  Where\\'s Julie? She\\'s in the back. Thanks. So I\\'ve seen you\\'ve met already. It\\'s Victor Rodriguez. Isn\\'t it amazing? He\\'s extraordinary.  Great show? Oh, this is Robert Miller. One of our collectors.  This is Alex Stanton and their daughter Ava? Alex.  She\\'s a talented young artist? Really? Painter?  Drawing? Drawing? That\\'s great. So, eh, I like the size of the paintings. I want to talk to you about them in a second.  Why are you doing this? Go away. Emma, let me see the list.  I will take these two? Okay.  What\\'s the Rubik\\'s Cube in the back there? Right there. Number seven. All right. Great. Don\\'t tell her it was me.  No problem? I mean it. You got it. Excuse me. Who is this? It\\'s me. What do you want? I\\'m here.  Where? I\\'m in your bedroom. Came in the back. Can you get those people out of here?  Are you serious? Look at your bedroom door. Do you see me? Yeah, I see you? I\\'m serious. Excuse me, guys. I\\'m sorry. I know, I know. You just come in and out whenever you want? I thought we should talk. One damn night in a month.  I told you it was important to me? I was working. You understand that? I have obligations.  I don\\'t want to hearI\\'m under a lot of pressure right now.  I don\\'t want to hear about your obligations!I could use a little help. If you cared, you would have been there. I was there. I was there! I was late, but I was there. And I\\'m here now. No, no, no. You\\'re here when it\\'s convenient for you to be here. Love means you fucking show up. Sorry.  Why did you buy those paintings? Because I liked them. Okay. Thank you for helping me to get started, but if I\\'m going to fail, then let me fail. Julie, you won\\'t fail. Why would you fail? You know, I\\'m not the kind of guy that wants to throw money away. You want to start a business, you have to project a certain image. What image? Success. The market is a disaster right now. For everybody. No one\\'s moving anything. So that\\'s why you\\'ve got to show sales. People look at you then and they say, \"Wow, how did she do that?\" That\\'s what they remember. Always. You\\'re never going to leave her. Come away with me. Let\\'s take your car and go. Where? It\\'s a place I\\'m staying. Beautiful, on the water. We could wake up there, together, just you and me.  I\\'d like that? Me, too. Just one more chance To prove it\\'s you alone I care for Each night I say a little prayer for Just one more chance Just one more night. Ahh! Jul Julie? Julie? God! Fuck! Fuck! Ow!  Yes, I want to make it collect? Your name, sir? Lawrence Grant. Who the fuck is this? Jimmy, it\\'s me. Robert? I want you to listen to me very, very closely. Vehicle is 978, brown Mercedes, registered to a Julie Cote? Douche.    th street. Subject is a French national. You\\'ve got to be fucking kidding me. Catching Detective wants us to rule before he calls it. We\\'ve been having the same fucking argument for  years. He can\\'t handle one drunk motorist who kills herself? You know what? I\\'m not so sure about this. If the car rolled on multiple impacts, but she was here and her feet were down here. So who kicked out the door? Let\\'s go. You want to tell me what this is? Better you don\\'t ask. So all you\\'re saying is you need a ride somewhere.  That\\'s correct? Because I\\'m going to be very clear about this. All right? You called me up for a ride. I showed up, I gave you a ride. No, you didn\\'t. We\\'re not here. Then where the fuck are we? We\\'re both asleep right now, at home.  Which is where you left your phone, right? Right.  Yeah, \\'cause if anyone checksWhy is anybody going to check? Well, they\\'re not. As long as we\\'re not here.  Anybody know you\\'re here? No.  Somebody knows you\\'re here? No.  Somebody knows you\\'re not there? My girl, but  Ah, Jimmy! Jesus Christ!You call me up at 2: a? m.!  What the fuck you want? I fucking told you! She asked me where I was going. All right? All right, what did you say? I told her I had to run out a minute.  You trust her? Is this the kind of shit you used to do to my dad?  Do you trust her? Yes, I fucking trust her!  I fucking trust her? All right, all right. Good.  Good. You\\'re at home and I\\'m at home? Jesus. My wife gets up at 5: a? m. for Pilates. I\\'ll be there next to her. That\\'s where I\\'ve been all night long.  You do the same with yours? I don\\'t know, man.  This is some pretty fucked-up shit. Seriously? Jimmy, just fucking do it.  Don\\'t think about itNo, fuck that, man! I don\\'t hear from you since the fucking funeral, you call me up out of the blue, using my father\\'s name? What is it? Do you want money? Is that what you want? I\\'ll give you money, all right? I will give you $5,. I will give you $10,. 20,000. I\\'ll give you whatever you fucking You want to talk to me like this?! You can get the fuck out of my car and you can walk. You want that?  You want to fucking walk home? I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m not myself right now. You came and you picked me up. I need your help, you helped me. I need your help. I\\'m sorry. You all right? Jesus, man! What the fuck happened to you?  We got to get you to a hospital. Right now? No, no.  I just got to get home? Rob, it looks like you\\'re bleeding inside, man. I\\'ll deal with it in a couple of hours. What if you don\\'t make it a couple of hours? Then I don\\'t make it. Call me, all right? Let me know everything is okay. Yeah, it\\'s best we don\\'t talk for a while. Hey, yo! So that\\'s it? You get in a bind and just call up the only nigga you know? Jimmy. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m really sorry. Go on home? Yeah, all right. Just go? You take care of that. Fuck! Everything okay, sir? No, I\\'m fine, Glen. Go back to bed. Where did you go? What? I woke up and you weren\\'t here.  I just went to get some ice cream? Mm. Was it good?  Yes? Good. Don\\'t forget to take your Lipitor in the morning.  Ellen? Hmm?  Do you still love me? Of course I do. Hypothetically, the situation you\\'re describing would be involuntary manslaughter.  Such a personWould be in a lot of trouble. Especially if that person were closing a merger with a large public bank where any publicity or arrest could delay or derail the transaction, but that\\'s only if there were some evidence that could link him to the crime.  Fingerprints? DNA? Very hard to collect after an explosion. Real world is different from television. What about cell phone records?  Did this person make any calls from the area? Not from a cell phone. No. Then they won\\'t be able to place him there. What would you advise such a person to do? To confess immediately.  Failing which? To put as much distance between himself and the event as possible. If possible. But let me tell you something. And I\\'m speaking to you as a friend now. There\\'s about  things that person wouldn\\'t have thought of. And the more time that passes, the more lies that are told, the worse it gets for him. Robert? Yeah?  They\\'re going to come to you? I know. An accident is not the worst trouble. If we talk to them now, we can probably work it out. Now you tell me what happens if the Standard deal does not close.  I got to tell my investors about our real losses? Nothing good. What did you say about the Justice Department? Depending on what they decide to arrest me on?  Fraud conviction gets me  years? I did. What choice do I really have? Now, you\\'re aware Congress plans to extend the audit requirements for private funds? Of course I am aware. I gave testimony to the committee. You know this? I know, but anyway, Standard wants to prepare for it now. So I was asked to go through every one of your trading books and reconfirm the assets? No, no. Absolutely not. It\\'s impossible. Don\\'t worry, I gave different books to the team and I kept Old Hill for myself. Anyway, I\\'m here to tell you I cleared it. The audit\\'s cleared? The report will be issued today. Actually, I\\'m calling it my \"swan song.\"  You\\'re leaving? Yeah, on Friday. You know, it\\'s a five-year clock.  And why? To prevent exactly what we\\'re doing, but honestly .there is nothing left to worry about. It\\'s great. Get out? Okay. What? How was it?  What? The show. What the fuck are you talking about? The show. Julie\\'s show. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was fine.  Mayfield\\'s here? He\\'s here? Where? Sherry-Netherland. He checked in about an hour ago.  He called? No. Brooke has a friend on the executive committee who said he\\'s taking meetings in his room. I don\\'t know. Maybe he\\'s settling in. You think we\\'re dealing with a fucking idiot? I spoke to legal. They said that Standard will sign once they get the audit report.  Yeah, it\\'s being issued now? How do you know that? Never mind that. Just find out why Mayfield hasn\\'t called us.  How am I supposed toDo I have to do every goddamn thing myself? Just find out, will you? Please? Thank you.  I really can\\'t reconcile this? Reconcile what? The Old Hill fund. Dad, are you listening to me? Yeah, of course I\\'m listening. Okay, those trades are in the special book. They don\\'t get audited here on the same balance sheet. Wait, but look at the sheet. There\\'s a $ million hole here. I mean, that can\\'t be right.  Evening? May I help you? Detective Bryer.  I was hoping to see Mr. Miller? Is he expecting you? Possibly. I really have no idea what\\'s going on, but the way that this sheet reads  half of the fund\\'s assets are missing? That\\'s ridiculous.  I mean, it can\\'t be right? Right. It\\'s ridiculous  and yet that\\'s whatOkay, okay, look. I I\\'ll look into this. I promise you. I\\'ll look into it.  Yeah? There\\'s a Detective Bryer here to see you.  Eh, give me a minute, then send him in? Okay.  Thanks? Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It\\'s just my next meeting came here a little early. That\\'s all. We\\'re going to have to pick this up later. Mom is looking for the hospital check. Brooke, we\\'ll pick it up later. Detective Bryer? Hi, I\\'m Cindy. Mr. Miller\\'s personal assistant. Right this way. Yeah, sorry to keep you waiting. You can sit there. We just heard about it. Really terrible. Okay, so you\\'re an investor in the gallery? Correct.  How did you meet her? Eh through I think it was a charity function.  My wife and I have a foundation? Okay.  When did you last see her? Last night. At the gallery. You stayed till the doors closed? No, I I was only there a couple of minutes. I think I left around 10.  Where did you go? Home. You go straight home? Yeah, yeah.  You stayed home? Yeah.  Your wife home? Yes. Okay. Okay, so now back to the gallery. Did you see her with anyone? See her what do you mean? I mean, like, boyfriend. Someone she might of left with? Not that I noticed. No, no. The reason I ask is we haven\\'t located the driver. The driver? Yeah, the driver. Someone else was driving. So sometimes the driver will go for help and he\\'ll die tryin\\' you know,  soThis is awful. Yeah? This is truly awful. We\\'re searching the area right now. So no boyfriend, no that you know of? Actually, we didn\\'t talk about personal matters.  She was just an employee, right? She well, not an employee.  I was an investor? Why did you invest?  Why did I invest? Yeah, why did you invest? She had a great eye. She actually, she found me these Brice Mardens here. They went up in value very quickly, and it was on the basis of that that I agreed to fund some of the gallery. All right. Do you mind if we search her apartment?  Why would I mind? Well, it\\'s in your company\\'s name. So Right. Oh, yeah. Of course. Yeah. Sure. Go ahead. Now, Mr. Miller? Mm-hmm. Why would you lease an apartment for Miss Cote? I mean, is that something that you would normally do for an employee? Well, actually, I said that she wasn\\'t an employee. But she I think she\\'d just come over from Paris, if I remember, and she needed a place to entertain buyers. So you leased her an apartment? Well, it was through the holding company. You are a little confused by all this, aren\\'t you?  I am, I am, but I\\'ll get there. Give me time? All right. Now I don\\'t mean to be indelicate, but But you\\'re going to be indelicate. From what I can gather, she wasn\\'t exactly an art star. She worked for a couple of dealers in Paris, but Okay, I get it. So why would I invest in her and help her find a place? Something like that, yeah? It\\'s very simple, Detective. I invest in people I believe in. I thought she\\'d do well. I backed her, she did.  It\\'s as simple as that? Well, that seems to make sense.  Yeah? We all good with the apartment, then, right?  Yeah, yeah. That\\'s fine. Go ahead? Thanks.  What happened to your head? What? Your head. What happened to your head? That\\'s a nasty cut. I\\'ve been looking at that for the last five minutes.  Does it hurt you? No, no, no. I just  I hit it on the medicine cabinet? Last night?  This morning? Hate when that happens.  Me, too? Yeah. Well, thanks for the chat. No problem. Ellen Miller\\'s office. And it transformed them. Seriously. There\\'s a Detective Bryer in the lobby. And thanks again for your generosity. All right. I\\'ll see you then. Bye-bye.  Sorry, what? A Detective Bryer.  What does he want? I don\\'t know. Well, I\\'m late, so I just can\\'t deal with it right now.  Okay. What about these? Send them a thank-you note.  Zappos has been so generous. Thanks. Bye, guys? Okay. No problem.  Mrs. Miller? Yes.  Detective Bryer? Did you just call my office?  Yeah, I was hoping to talk to you? I don\\'t have time right now.  Sorry? It will just take a couple of seconds.  This is about your husband? Well, fine, but make an appointment.  How\\'d it go? Well, the wife blew me off. Which was interesting. He didn\\'t admit to the affair, but then he wouldn\\'t, would he?  Why didn\\'t you pick him out? He\\'s a very rich man.  Anything? Yeah, about  million prints.  What happened with the pay phones? Got about  calls in a three-mile two of them look a little strange. Got an incoming, which is probably a local drug deal.  And the one we care about? Collect call. About a minute and a half.  Made from the Chevron station on Westlake Road? Who\\'d he call? Cell phone in Harlem. Still waiting on the address. So you\\'re at the crash site. All right, and you make it out of the car. Now you\\'re smart enough not to use your own cell phone. So you get to a pay phone and you\\'re a billionaire. Right? You\\'re a billionaire. So what do you do? You call someone in Harlem? Robert? I just heard about Julie. I\\'m so sorry. Her gallery called. Her mom\\'s flying in today. Her mom.  Service here? Tomorrow. 9: a? m. Wow. We should pick up the expenses for that. Whatever she wants. You take care of that personally for me?  Of course? Thanks.  You all right? Did you get ahold of Mayfield? No. Not yet, but we\\'ll get him. Robert? IThanks. I appreciate your concern. Let\\'s flash him, let\\'s flash him. Hold on, you gonna go  Wait, right here. Mr. Grant? Yes. NYPD Homicide. Do you mind stepping in the car, please?  What\\'s this about? Just get in the car, Jimmy.  Am I under arrest? Do you want to be?  So let\\'s do this again? Man, for what? My answers ain\\'t going to change.  So you\\'re asleepRight.  and the phone ringsRight. And it\\'s a wrong number. Why do you accept the charges on a collect call from a wrong number? I don\\'t think I want to answer any more questions. And then you stay on the phone for a minute and a half with a wrong number. What the fuck do you talk about? Area codes? I want to talk to my lawyer? Listen, big man. We know you went down there. We ID\\'d your photo with your neighbor, who saw you get into your truck  minutes after the call was made. If you got all that, what the fuck do you need me for, Officer? I don\\'t think you understand the gravity of the situation here, Jimmy.  This is a homicide? Lawyer.  You\\'re going to sign him out? I called in Earl Monroe.  The basketball player? Civil rights attorney.  Remember Crown Heights? He\\'s the best? He\\'s the best above th Street. That doesn\\'t make him any cheaper. You got to get Jimmy out of this. Might not be that easy. If he doesn\\'t cooperate, they\\'re likely to indict him on obstruction.  What would he be looking at? Hard to say. With his prior, five years. Maybe 10. Jesus. Hey. This is not going to go away. Okay. I\\'m going to call you tomorrow if there\\'s any news. Don\\'t you worry about anything here. Don\\'t talk to anyone else. Take care. Come on. Get in. All you said was you needed a fucking ride. You didn\\'t tell me you killed that girl.  Jimmy, I didn\\'tI\\'m trying to put my life back together. Okay. I appreciate you helped us, but now you\\'re taking it too far.  It\\'s going to be okay, Jimmy? Like it was your ass sitting there. Like you know a fucking thing about how it\\'s going to be. We got you the best criminal lawyer in the city. Don\\'t you got your own son for this?  Why the hell you didn\\'t call him? Because he would have  fucked it up, all right? Okay. Well, I\\'m sorry your son is a fucking idiot,  but that ain\\'t my fault? This isn\\'t productive. Oh, okay, then, Syd.  Tell us, what happens now? We meet with Earl and we go from there. I understand right now they don\\'t have enough to charge you with anything. You\\'re under suspicion? Under suspicion?  Motherfucker, I\\'m black!I am aware of that. And what exactly would you like me to do about it? Gentlemen, my driver will take you where you want to go, but I cannot be a party to this conversation. So this is where I get out. Why couldn\\'t you have just stayed? I couldn\\'t.  Why not? Because I have responsibilities. If I stayed there, a lot of people would have gotten hurt.  Well, somebody was hurt? Other people, Jimmy. I got business troubles, you understand? People rely on me. Listen, I want to talk to you a second. Come here. I want to show you something. Just for a second. Come here.  Now, you know your father asked me to look after you? Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know. I messed up. I\\'m sorry. But I do want to help you. You know that. So I\\'ve been able to set up a situation for you.  What\\'s that? This is a trust. In your name, assets of $ million.  Take a look at that? Are you serious? You think money is going to fix this?  Huh? What else is there?  What are you doing? Yo, man. Pull over. What are you doing?  What are you going to do? Do I look like a fucking snitch to you? I don\\'t know, Jimmy. I don\\'t know. Are you? Wait, wait, wait. Look, sorry. Just read it. Just take it home and read it. It\\'s not going to hurt you.  Yeah? I\\'ve got Chris Vogler from Fremaut Accounting.  You asked me to interrupt you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put him through. Chris? Robert, I\\'ve run into some problems. Look, we\\'re doing a non-recommend? What? They got compliance involved, I\\'m sorry? Whoa, wait, wait, wait. Chris? Chris? Chris!I\\'ve got to go. Chris! Ch God damn it, Chris! Oh, Peter. Listen. I\\'m looking at some statements right now. How much did you book last quarter? Why? Eh, what do you care? Peter, I\\'m really just asking you. All right, eh, 35. million for your whole group? Yes.  million for my entire group. You sure it wasn\\'t 68?What?  million isn\\'t a big enough number for you? I know that it\\'s a big number? Well, what the fuck are you No Peter, I\\'ll call you later? What do you want? What are you doing in my office? Eh, hello?  Can you explain these? Explain what? Old Hill. All the numbers you falsified? You don\\'t know what you\\'re saying.  Get out of my way? Brooke.  You\\'re hurting my arm? Can\\'t you just leave it alone?  You\\'re fired, Ben? You can\\'t fire me.  Oh, I just did? Who do you think asked me to make those changes? You tell me. He was doing a little dealing a while back. Looks like he stopped. Any family? Eh, they\\'re all dead. Kid\\'s a good student. Magnet school. Whatever. Then his mom dies and he gets popped for gun possession. Even so, how come he got probation? He had an excellent lawyer. How the fuck could this kid afford Felder & Chos? Well, we pulled his parents\\' tax returns. Guess where his father worked for  years. Miller Capital? He was the fucking driver? Oh, wow. Oh, this guy\\'s good.  Where are you at with the kid? So far, he won\\'t budge. Well, he\\'s a convicted felon. We\\'ll get a warrant. Put him in front of a grand jury. Let\\'s see how long he holds out when he realizes he\\'s looking at  years off the prior. I\\'m sorry. Mr. Miller, as I explained from downstairs,  he\\'s on a call right Mr. Miller!Whoa. Robert, what the fuckTell me what is going on.  I can\\'t? Tell me what the fuck is going on!  I can\\'t, I can\\'t!This is my life! I know. It\\'s not me! Okay. The audit  What? The audit passed. It passed a week ago, like I said. Okay. Everything is fine. Money\\'s confirmed. It\\'s all straight and done.  It really is? Why did you tell me that it didn\\'t? Because they asked me to hold it. Okay? Who\\'s they?  Who is they?!Mayfield. Mayfield. What? They\\'re negotiating. He wants a better price. Sherry-Netherland? Yes. James Mayfield, please. Mr. Mayfield. Uh-huh. I think it\\'s time we had a talk.  It\\'s not going to hold? The warrant doesn\\'t need to hold. It just needs to scare him into giving up Miller. What is it, Mike? You stalled that big career, so you\\'re reaching for a high note? Who gives a fuck? This is about Judge Rittenband, right?  This is \\'cause he\\'s running again? You want to cost the judge his seat on a profiling claim against Earl Monroe? I\\'m getting a new piece of evidence that\\'s going to seal it 100%. Good. Bring it back to me when you got it. You can have it in your hand before you go in the jury room. Look, Ray. We like this kid. I don\\'t want to lose him. Think about it. If we flip him, you get Robert Miller, and what\\'s that worth to Rittenband? Or to you for that matter?  fucking years. Ray,  years we\\'ve watched these guys. They out-lawyer us, they out-buy us. I\\'m fucking sick of it. Where\\'s the consequence? The guy did it. He does not get to walk just because he\\'s on CNBC. Give me the warrant. You better not fuck me. Yeah. I need a serious fucking favor.  Brooke\\'s waiting for you? We had a meeting? No, but she looked upset. Sweetie, you okay? What\\'s wrong?  You want to sit? I\\'ll stand.  Didn\\'t you think I\\'d find out? I did.  Why didn\\'t you tell me? Because I hoped you wouldn\\'t. Oh, come on. You tell me the truth now or I am done.  I made a bad bet? No, you committed fraud.  That\\'s a dangerous word? What would you prefer? That you cheated? That you stole money from people who trust you? That you lied that you lied right to my face?!  Why? Because we were going broke. Everything was finished.  We\\'d have nothing? How? How does that happen? How? You remember Alexandrov? He came to see me one day last year. He said, \"Robert, you got a great opportunity. There\\'s a copper mine in Russia. It\\'s under-exploited, there\\'s billions under the ground. To get it out, all we need is a couple hundred million. You put in 100, we\\'ll put in 100. We\\'ll triple it in six months.\" I was skeptical, so I go check it out. Geological survey\\'s right. Friendly government. And to lock it in, you hedge it. Right? We sell the copper ahead. Commodities exchange and it all works. It\\'s fine. We\\'re making a fortune. And then there\\'s something that I hadn\\'t accounted for. A variation margin. And that friendly Russian government not so friendly anymore. They\\'re blocking the exported copper. So I got to pony up. I got to put the cash in to cover the hedge. But I\\'m not worried about it because it\\'s still springing money. There\\'s so much money coming out of this ground, you can\\'t believe it. You can\\'t you can\\'t stop it. Yes. I\\'m the oracle. I have done housing. I\\'ve arb\\'d credit swaps. I have done it all. Yes. I know it\\'s outside the charter, but it is fucking minting money. It is it\\'s a license to print money for everybody. Forever! It is God.  Until? Until it\\'s not. The money\\'s trapped. I can\\'t get it out. I probably never will. It\\'s like a plane crash. It just happens. It does not just happen? It just happened, honey. You are so naive sometimes. You\\'re young, but you\\'re not that young. It happens. And like any father, I pray that it doesn\\'t happen to you.  Happily, because of me, it won\\'t happen to you? Thanks to you,  we all may be arrested? No one\\'s getting arrested. That\\'s why I borrowed the money from Jeffrey. Plugged the hole. They see that the books are fine. Transfer the company, I pay back Jeffrey with interest. I make all our investors whole and what\\'s left, we keep. At least we get to keep the house.  Everybody wins? Yes.  If we sell the company? It\\'ll sell.  If I lie for you? You don\\'t have to lie. You didn\\'t know about it. That\\'s why I didn\\'t tell you. I\\'m the chief investment officer of this company. What do you think they\\'re going to say at the deposition? \"She didn\\'t know\"? They\\'ll take away my brokerage license. Failure to supervise you. My name in every paper and blog while I visit your ass in jail! What do you want me to do? Did you want to let our investors go bankrupt? Is that what you wanted? You wanted people to get really hurt?!  What gives you the audacity to think that you..You want those lives  can make othersBecause it\\'s my job!  Job? It\\'s illegal? Yes. It\\'s illegal and I am your partner. You are not my partner. You work for me. That\\'s right. You work for me. Everybody works for me. Come here. Brooke. Please. Please. Come here. Just just for a second. Sit down. There\\'s something I want to tell you. Whatever you decide, I won\\'t blame you. I\\'m on my own path. It\\'s up to you to move with it or against it. But I\\'m the patriarch. That\\'s my role. I have to play it. For a moment there, I thought you were going to say you\\'re sorry. I\\'m sorry. Hey, Jimmy.  Come on, man. What? Take a ride with me.  Where? Back to the station? No, man. Just get in the car.  What if I say no? I\\'m not threatening you. I\\'m just asking you. Take a ride with me. Wasting my time, Detective. What? Well, it\\'s pretty fucking simple. I know you went to pick him up. So that\\'s what you want to talk about?  I told you, I ain\\'t making no more statements? And I know why.  Somebody cares? Here. Take a look at this. Take it. I got his phone calls. I got his text messages. I got his relationship with the girl. They were fucking, by the way. And then I got you. I got the time log from the pay phone. I got a fucking tollbooth photograph of you driving your car through the Triborough. Where you got that? That\\'s bullshit \\'cause I ain\\'t do it. It\\'s impossible. Really? Look, you lied to me. You lied to the police. You obstructed justice.  Talk to Earl, Detective? Fuck Earl. You see this? This means that tomorrow, grand jury hears your case in court. And tomorrow in court, I\\'m going to ask for a felony obstruction indictment. With your prior, you\\'re going to prison for  fucking years. You might get out in 10, but then you\\'ll be, what? 33? With no job. No girl. No life. Look. I know you think Miller\\'s your friend.  Who\\'s Miller? I know about your father. You don\\'t know a goddamn thing about my father. I know that Miller paid his bills while he was dying. I know he got Syd Felder to get you out of trouble on your gun charge. That doesn\\'t add up to this? You done? Okay. He\\'s driving he crashes, he runs away. Who\\'s he call? He calls you. Why do you think that is? Because you\\'re disposable. You\\'re the one person he can call that just doesn\\'t fucking matter. You\\'re a you\\'re a throwaway? Yeah. You\\'re just another part of his transaction. Will you open the door? So what? You\\'re his new nigga now? Open open the fucking door! I\\'m not fucking playin\\' with you, man. Open the door. You didn\\'t kill that girl. He did? Will you open the door? He\\'s using you. I know it. You know it. Do the right thing. Now get out of my fucking car. What do you think? He\\'s going to walk. You\\'re certain? Courts aren\\'t for certainty, but he says he was at home. Why shouldn\\'t he be? Phone call doesn\\'t make him a liar.  It\\'s not great? What\\'s baffling to me, though, despite your sentimental history together, is why you would put your family\\'s future in this kid\\'s hands. He\\'s not like us. Is that a good thing? I don\\'t know.  How\\'s Ellen? She\\'s good. Fine. Same.  Why? I heard something.  Yes? She met with Gil Deustchman.  The estate lawyer? Yeah. Has she mentioned anything? Not to me. That was the early morning of April th. Yes? You received a phone call? Yes? Who called you?  It was a wrong number? That\\'s a lie. Isn\\'t it, Mr. Grant? No. You were on the phone one and a half minutes. Isn\\'t it the case you know exactly who called you and exactly why? Why are you lying to this grand jury? I\\'m not lying. I\\'m going to introduce into evidence People\\'s A. This is a tollbooth photograph taken in the northbound ninth lane of Triborough excuse me, the RFK Bridge. Mr. Grant, directing your attention to the photograph. Would you please read the date and time stamp indicated on the upper right-hand corner.  This is crazy? You\\'ve got to answer. Mr. Grant, please answer the question. April th, 2: a? m. Again, directing your attention to the same photograph. Would you please read the license plate of the vehicle passing through the toll? A-O-C-  3. This is People\\'s B. A printout from the Department of Motor Vehicles plate registry. Mr. Grant, directing your attention to that printout. Are the numbers on the toll photograph the same ones that are on your own license plate? Mr. Grant? Yes. Yes, the numbers are the same? Yes.  How do you explain that? I can\\'t. But that is your car in this photograph. Isn\\'t it?  No? No, that is not your car? Answer the question, Mr. Grant. This is not my car in this picture. I don\\'t know how y\\'all did that, but this isn\\'t my car. You expect this grand jury to believe that, that is not your car, when there is a printout from the Department of Motor Vehicles? That\\'s asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito? Mr. Monroe, you are aware that you\\'re not permitted to go on record? Jimmy.  Jimmy, Jimmy, wait? What?  What was that? They\\'re lying.  Okay. Now here\\'sYou can halt the decision. Detective, we need a minute, please. How about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?  Because if you doGet the fuck out of my face. How about that? So you want to keep playing games or are you ready to tell me something? Detective, I need to speak with my client. So now if you would just please How how are y\\'all just going to lie like that? Huh?  How are y\\'all just gonna lie? We didn\\'t lie. You lied.  That wasn\\'t my car? Jimmy, don\\'t say anything else. Sure, it wasn\\'t. And it was a telemarketer called you from the pay phone who stopped at the Chevron to make a late-night sale.  That picture was some bullshit? Jimmy, stop. Detective, what\\'s going on? Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy. Tell him. See how your boss will like this one. Last chance. Wait here. Mr. Miller? I would like to introduce you to Julie\\'s mom. Sandrine. I\\'m so, so sorry. I want to thank you for everything you did for my daughter. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You believed in her. You gave her a chance. She was happy. I know she was happy. It\\'s not fair, is it? Not fair. It shouldn\\'t have happened. .rail thin. She\\'s a blonde. I would have known who she was if she didn\\'t come up and introduce herself to me. She looked totally different. She\\'s living in Miami and You\\'re going straight to level six? Don\\'t you think you better pace yourself a little bit? I\\'m good. I want to run. Something the matter? You and Tom all right? We\\'re fine. You worried about the deal closing?  No? Do you want me to guess? Come on, Brooke. Don\\'t be silly.  Tell me what\\'s going on? You know, I can\\'t stay for breakfast today. I have to just I got to get into work. I don\\'t know what I was thinking. Did you finish the deal with the hospital? Uh, no.  Did he write the check? No.  Why not? Issues related to the closing. We don\\'t lie to each other, Brooke? I\\'m not lying to you. It\\'s complicated. You wouldn\\'t understand. You know, I know that the that the police came to the office. Do you know what that\\'s about?  I honestly have no idea? How about your father\\'s head? Where he cut his head and the pain that he\\'s hiding in his stomach and the fact that he hasn\\'t slept? And now, for some reason, it\\'s way too complicated for me to understand? There\\'s no money for a routine gift? Does that seem a little strange?  Of course it\\'s strange? So tell me what\\'s happening. What do you want me to say? He\\'s my dad.  I have to trust him? No. You have to do what\\'s right for you. Not him. Not me. Not anyone. This is your life. I love you. I\\'ve got to go. Mr. Mayfield. You keep sending people to my office  to do business? They\\'re just getting acquainted. Yeah. The intricacies of my operation, so that you cannot buy it? Just coffee, thanks. You remember what it was like on our side of the fence. Everything just moves a little slower. Plus, this whole audit mess doesn\\'t help. You know, clearing that all up.  Fuck you? Excuse me? Fuck you. I am the oracle of Gracie Square. You came to me. I did not come to you.  Robert, I think we\\'re getting off on the wrong foot? No, no, no. Forget it. Forget the deal. I don\\'t even care about the deal. No, I run a very comfortable no, excuse me. I run a thriving business. It has returned, year to date, 15.4%. Approximately $ million from an operation that you don\\'t have and we both know you need. Which is why you called me in the first place. You, on the other hand, you take a salary of $ million. And what are you doing with it? Falling stock price no, negative 16? Is that what it is? You\\'ve also lost approximately . billion to your investors. Tell me, why the fuck do I need you?  Let\\'s just calm down? You know what we\\'re gonna do? We\\'re gonna put out a press release. Immediately. Today. We\\'re gonna say there\\'s no deal. There never was a deal. You\\'re not going to be buying Old Hill. You\\'re not going to be buying Quantum. You\\'re not going to be buying anything. You? You\\'re just a browser. Me? I\\'m going to continue to enjoy my earnings. And while I soar on princely wings to my next winning enterprise, your shares are going to drop another couple of bucks based on a failed acquisition attempt. Bodes well for your tenure, doesn\\'t it? Your price is too high. You have a nice day, James. 14400.  550.450. 14525. That\\'s it. Yes or no. And if it\\'s no, that\\'s any further communications  goes right into my trash can? It\\'s a deal. One other thing. Six months, I\\'m going to be gone. I\\'m out of here. My daughter\\'s going to take it over. You know her, you trust her.  All right? And you\\'re going to have to make my son a VP.  Robert? No, no. He doesn\\'t have to do anything. He just gets a salary. He gets the office. Five-year employment contract for both of them. My lawyers draft them. Yes or no?  Yes? Okay.  What are you doing? I\\'m writing the deal.  You\\'re not serious? Yeah. I\\'m serious. Very serious. Sign it. I\\'ll send over a draft of the press release. You all right? Yeah, yeah. I\\'m fine. Before I leave, what would you have paid? 16600. And you would have taken? 17475.  So we made a good deal? Yeah. Actually, I lied. I would have taken 400. Anyway, I will be seeing most of you at the gala tomorrow night. Since the sale is official, as of this afternoon, you\\'re free to talk about it now.  More questions? Will we get new business cards? Yes. Everyone but you. All right. Thank you all very, very much. You\\'re going to be proud of this. It\\'s a good day. Your hard work made it happen. Thank you all. Thank you, thank you, thank you. So how did you get Mayfield to come around? I met his price. Took it out of your share.  Hey, Robert? Yeah?  Nice job? Well, thank you. Now go get me that fucking hospital check. Yeah? It\\'s not good. Hello. You want something to drink?  What do you got? Not much.  Got any milk? Nope. I\\'ll take a water. Where are you going? What?  Boxes? Was planning on Virginia. Looks like I\\'m not going anymore. What? You waiting on me to say something?  I told you not to take the toll? Yeah, you did. I said listen carefully. Follow my directions. Do exactly what I tell you to do.  You said all that? But you took the toll anyway.  No, I did not? Don\\'t fucking lie to me. I\\'m not lying. I took  the whole goddamn way there. I did what you said. I didn\\'t stop. I didn\\'t take the Triborough. I followed all your fucking instructions.  Then where did they get the photograph from? You tell me.  You\\'re saying it\\'s a fake? How did you get so fucking rich again?  Don\\'t be such a wise-ass? This is my fucking life, man. Earl\\'s telling me it could be  years!  fucking years! How much is  years worth, Robert? Look, man. I told you, I ain\\'t no fucking snitch. But this is bad. This is real bad. Me and Reina got a whole plan we about to make happen next week.  What plan? I got money saved up. Buying a business.  What business? I bought an Applebee\\'s.  What\\'s an Applebee\\'s? It\\'s a fucking restaurant.  It\\'s a chain restaurant? You bought an Applebee\\'s in Virginia? Is this really what you came here to talk about?  What are you gonna do? It\\'s not really that simple, Jimmy.  I\\'m in a situation now? What situation? I told you. Right now, if I were to speak, a lot of people would get hurt. Jobs. Families. A lot of innocent people. Do you think you can understand that? Yeah, but what about me? What about my situation? They showed me the pictures. That\\'s fucked up what you did.  And I know all the people counting on you. Whatever? It was an accident. But you told me Earl was gonna make this right. Robert, you know I care about you. All the things you did for us and for my father. But Earl said they\\'ll offer me a deal. No charges at all. I walk away. They just want to know who I went to pick up. Why are you putting me in this situation, man? Why are you putting me in this position? Can you just hang tight? Can you do that? Just a little longer. All right, but Earl said the deal is on the table for  hours. After that, they\\'re going to file a case. Earl says we\\'re going to lose. All right. Just hang with me a little bit. You got to give him up. You said take the money. Yeah. That was to keep quiet, not to go away. What\\'s he offering you now? What can he offer me? We went to the toll authority and they said they gave the tape to the cops. I requested our investigator go examine it at the evidence room, but honestly, what\\'s the point? He says he didn\\'t take the toll? And you believe him? Does Standard have claw-back? What? What do you mean? Let\\'s just say I decide to go in? Have you lost your mind? Wait a minute. Just listen. Listen to me. If I were to surrender now could they roll back the deal? No. What\\'s done is done. There\\'s no intention of fraud, you haven\\'t warranted any behavior. So it\\'s just money? Four years, you think? I don\\'t know. At this point, they\\'re not going to make it easy. I really suggest you think about this. Call the D? A. Get it started. Yeah, Glen. Mrs. Miller say where she was going tonight? Ah. No, I\\'ll try her her cell. Thank you. Hi, this is Ellen Miller. I\\'m not available right now. Syd? Yeah, yeah. Did you make that call to the D? A. yet? Thank God. No, no, no, no, no. Listen to me. Call Earl. Tell him to get his car. Tell him to meet us over here at my house in  minutes. Yeah, and Syd? Bring a notary. I\\'m going to need a receipt, please. Thank you. You have a good night now. Hi. I\\'m Brent Owens. Night Supervisor. How can I help you? Hello, Brent. I\\'m Earl Monroe. I\\'m issuing a criminal evidence request. I\\'m going to need to have a look at one of your lane tapes. I don\\'t understand. This says you want to look at a tape that was made ten minutes ago? Wait, wait. Just wait. Okay. They won\\'t release tape without a court order, but they did give me a printout. The same kind they used at Jimmy\\'s indictment.  Your car? With plates? Yes. Okay. You got Jimmy\\'s? Thanks. Son of a bitch. They look a little different to me, too. Is there a reason why you haven\\'t allowed Mr. Monroe\\'s investigator to conduct his own analysis? We\\'ve had some issues regarding chain of custody. Now you don\\'t have them anymore. You\\'re to meet with him, with the evidence, in the next hour. I\\'m afraid that\\'s not possible. Where is the tape? Am I not speaking loud enough? Your Honor? Yes?  There seems to beLet him tell me.  We don\\'t know where it is? Come again?  It\\'s not in the evidence locker? Where is it?  We don\\'t know? I\\'ll ask you one more time, Detective. Where is the tape? We lost it? Mm. In light of these developments and I would think you should be very happy to hear this. With Mr. Monroe\\'s approval, I\\'m going to offer Mr. Deferlito the opportunity to voluntarily dismiss the indictment to save us all a bunch of embarrassment.  I don\\'t feel comfortable with that, Your Honor? Further, I\\'m going to put all charges against Mr. Grant under seal. This case is dismissed with prejudice and not to be refiled. Hold on, Detective. If you have another suspect in the automobile death, then you are to present him. But Mr. Grant is free from any further inquiry. This is over. Do I have your understanding? Thank you. Close the door, Detective. Please. You finessed this. Didn\\'t you?  I\\'m sorry? You finessed it. I know it and you know it. I know who you\\'re after. I saw all the evidence. Not just a toll photo.  You got to get him the right way? Oh. Okay. So let me get this straight. What you\\'re telling me is I\\'m supposed to sit around with my thumb up my ass and my fingers crossed, hoping that one of these fucking days, somewhere down the line, one of these rich assholes is gonna say the wrong thing loud enough so that we can\\'t choose to ignore him anymore? Get the fuck out of my office. Yes, Your Honor.  Well, when do you expect her? Hey.  When do you expect her? What\\'s going on? So I don\\'t have to call you a ninth time, can you take down what I\\'m saying? Word for word. Exactly. Okay. You got a pencil? All right. Are you ready? Okay. Here goes. Mrs. Miller, exactly how fucking stupid do you really think I am? He didn\\'t hurt anybody. He helped a lot of people.  This piece of paper makes everything okay? No. It makes it easier. You heard him say something. No. Robert, look. You asked me to come meet you and I\\'m here. But I came because I want to get something straight between us. We\\'re even. Okay. We\\'re even. Just for the record, though, what you did, way beyond the money. Nothing beyond money for you, Robert. We both know that.  Thanks a lot? If I take this what does that say about me? Fuck it. I\\'m going to take your money. I\\'m going to do something good with it. Hey, sweetie. What time do you want to get there? I don\\'t want to get there too soon. How late do you think it will go? You okay? What is it?  You spoke to Brooke? She told you that? No, she didn\\'t have to.  Yeah, I explained to BrookeYou explained?  Did you tell her everything? Yeah. Yes. Everything?  Lift up your shirt? What? Lift up your shirt. Did you tell her about this?  Ellen, I don\\'t know what you think you know? Don\\'t treat me like an idiot. You\\'ve been sneaking off to see her for months. You don\\'t think I know?  What do you think you know? I never cared, really, about your secretaries, your gallerists, your whores, whatever you want to call them. I cared about our home.  Now you brought this to our door? I did what was necessary. No, you did what was necessary for you, Robert, for your interests. For my interests? Yes. Everything I do is for us. For this family.  Now you\\'re telling me how to run my business? This isn\\'t about business! This is our life! Where do you think we\\'re going tonight? What do you think I\\'ve tolerated all of this for so long? You tolerated? Wow.  I\\'m glad you find that funny? What about me? What about me? What about the complaints? The unhappiness? The drinking? The shopping? The trainers? Everything! But, yes, the charities. The wonderful, sainted charities. You know, all the wonderful things that you do. How do you think I pay for them? I didn\\'t ask you because I didn\\'t want you to lie.  Because you didn\\'t want to give them up? I thought that we had an understanding, and you broke that understanding when you brought Brooke into it.  No, I kept her out? When you made Brooke complicit.  When you risked her future, and I\\'m done? I kept her out.  What is this? Read it. All ownership and voting rights transfer to the Miller Charitable Foundation to be administered by Brooke Miller.  You really expect me to sign this thing? You\\'re not following.  Apparently not. No, no? Okay. Um, the police have been trying to talk to me. I assume because they want to know where you were that night. I\\'m not going to lie for you.  Not unless you sign that? Yeah. This leaves me with nothing. I think you\\'ll find a way to manage. I\\'m sure you have all kinds of things offshore for a rainy day.  This is fucking crazy? If you sign it, then I will tell your lie. I will say that I was with you that night. All night, here. And you will be free and clear. And the people that need our money will get it. That\\'s my price. You are out of your mind. I am not signing this. I will not sign that! Well, then, I will have to tell them that you came home at 4:.  bruised and bleeding? Why would you tell them? That\\'s fucking ridiculous. What  You trying to blackmail me? I think we call it negotiating. You\\'re not going to win that one. There\\'s no fucking way. Then you know what? It will cause just enough trouble, the kind of trouble that you don\\'t want.  Apparently, according to my lawyer, it\\'s enoughFucking lawyer  to give them probable cause? Fuck!  Then they can subpoena your DNA and your cell phone andFuck the DNA!  I\\'m sick of this shit!So, really, Robert. What you have is a choice. You can either be in court and the tabloids for the next three years, or you can be at your business. You won\\'t do this. You won\\'t do it.  You wouldn\\'t do it to the kids? Just try me. You broke our little girl\\'s heart. It\\'s how it all works, Ellen.  You know that? I know.  But she didn\\'t? She\\'ll be better for it. The world is cold. Then you\\'re going to need a warm coat. There\\'s one more thing. I hate to mention it now  but I just received it? Speak, John. I had Stern Marling do a secondary audit on the Miller financials. Who authorized this? I did. What did you conclude? It\\'s in front of you. I didn\\'t ask you what the paper said, John. I asked you what you thought. What do you think? I think I think I don\\'t see anything wrong here. And to receive this prestigious award I invite now to the stage the man who led this generous effort and whose financial trading firm, Miller Capital, was just this morning acquired by Standard Bank & Trust. A dedicated businessman, a family man, philanthropist, and all-around humanitarian. A man I am very lucky to call my mentor, my friend, and my father. Mr. Robert Miller. I see Who you are Behind the skin And the muscles I see Who you are now And when You get older later I will see the same girl The same soul Lioness, fire heart Passionate lover And afterwards Later this century When you and I Have become corpses Let\\'s celebrate now All this flesh on our bones Let me push you Up against me tightly And enjoy Every bit of you Let\\'s celebrate now All this flesh on our bones Let me push you Up against me tightly Let\\'s celebrate now All this flesh on our bones And enjoy Every bit of you I see Who you are now I see.'),\n",

She looks well spoken for. Never know your luck, though. Eh, mate? Think l'll give her the treatment!No, Steve, no. Don't do that? No, you're all right? Don't do that. Steve. Steve! Hello, love. l've got something to show ya. Are you out of your mind or what? You fuckin' little prick! And l mean little! Don't judge a book by its cover, sweetheart?

Tell him if he doesn't put that thing away, ..l'll rip it off and shove it down his fuckin' throat! Do your flies up, you fuckin' animal. You almost gave me a heart attack.Just leave it. lt's not worth it! He's done it again. l had to pull him off! Fuckin' right laugh! Aagghh! Aagghh! Nick! Nick! You all right? Nick! lt was thanks to Maggie Thatcher opening up the City of London ..that yours truly from Watford came to be working for a posh outfit like Barings. That was me lying on the floor, if you hadn't guessed. Nick Leeson. You've probably heard about me. Barings was the oldest private bank in the world. They financed the Louisiana Purchase back in eighteen hundred and something. They even had the Queen as a customer! l was just a humble clerk. But not for long, l hoped. Car crash. l hit my head on the back of the seat and broke my nose. Everybody else was all right cos they were wearing their, um seat belts. Poor chap! Nick, l know you're keen to get out of the back office and onto the trading floor, ..but in the meantime something else has come up. We've got problems in our Jakarta office. We need someone to go out there and sort things out. l thought that someone might be ..Nick Leeson? lndonesia was one of the new ''tiger economies'' ..everyone was getting so excited about. ''Emerging markets'' they were calling them, ..and Barings was one of the first to see their potential. The rewards were high. But so were the risks. One hundred million pounds ..in bearer bonds. As good as cash. We could pick 'em up, walk out, ..come to some arrangement with laughing boy Customers refuse to pay for them. They say what's on them doesn't match the original deal. The real reason: the market goes down, they don't want any more. lt's a mess. You're absolutely  per cent right, Susi. lt's one hell of a fuckin' mess. lt was my job to sort out the certificates ..so customers wouldn't have any more excuses not to pay. Until then, Barings had this bloody great hole in their balance sheet. lt was boring work, but l knew if l made a success of it ..then l could write my own ticket. All the certificates are in the right denomination. l've sorted out all the documentation. That's all in order now, so ..all l need from you ..is a cheque! Hello. l'm Lisa. l'm, um Nick Leeson. Can l help you? Barings sent me to help with the settlements. Didn't they tell you? Oh, of course! l've been on at them for so long l never thought they'd get round to it. What do we do with that lot? Build a bonfire? l'd never even heard of Barings before l started working for 'em. lt's not like there's a Barings in Watford. You're a hero in London. They think the sun shines out of your arse. Really? l was beginning to feel like one of those Japanese soldiers. Still stuck out in the jungle  years after the war! What's it like here? They tell me it's not safe at night. Bollocks. The locals are great. And it's not full of pompous ex-colonials thinking they were born to rule the world. That's what l love about Asia. Anyone can make it. Doesn't matter which school you went to. When they told me l was going to Jakarta l had to look it up on the map. As a matter of fact, so did l. l really want to be a trader. lf Barings don't let me on the floor after this, l'm off? Not gonna be bloody clerking all my life? Ooh! Ambitious, aren't we? ls that bad? lt's great. l just want to get on in life. l like to enjoy myself, don't get me wrong. Work hard, play hard. Well, l think this is me. Well, night, Nick. That was fun.  Yeah, it was, wasn't it?  OK. Night-night!See you tomorrow, then. Lisa was a stunner all right. Love at first sight. Together we made short work of the rest of those bonds. Soon we cleared up most of Barings' losses and it was time to go home. See you later, Lisa. Bye. laughs l think you'll agree that in Nick Lisa has met her prince. guests Hear! Hear! Join me in wishing them well in their new life in Singapore, where Nick is to be general manager of the trading floor.

A couple more in the back office. No need to pay top dollar. Get them young, get them hungry and train them up.  l'm a bottom line kind of guy, Nick? Absolutely. That's my philosophy. l took him at his word. My team were young, hungry and they didn't have a clue.

No one's playin'. 7590, and trading small. 7600, and thin too.  here. There's a seller who wants to trade in size. Shall l low-tick him? Yeah. Flush him out.  Squeeze the sucker? How many? 7200. Buy them now.  Buy 'em!Filled! We paid  for 200. Way to go, Nick! l sold at 590. Fuck a duck! Just made 2, quid. Yes! ''Money'' continues They were a good bunch and they were keen to learn. lt looked like a madhouse with all the traders waving and shouting, but it all made sense once you got the hang of it. There were hiccups, but that's normal in any operation, especially a new one like ours. The important thing was we were picking up the business and the future looked rosy. Nick, what's the difference between initial margin and variation margin? lnitial margin's a down payment on each futures contract that we trade. We don't pay in full until a contract matures. But in the meantime the value of each contract may go up or down. So SlMEX calculate our positions on a daily basis. They'll ask for more money if the market goes against us. That's variation margin. Got it. l think! We need to open an errors account. We've had a few mistakes. l need somewhere to put them till l can write them out. Sure. What number shall l give it?  Well, what's your lucky number? Eight. lt is a very lucky Chinese number. And how many numbers do we need? Five. Then let's give it all the luck it can handle. Call it the  account. And now it gives me great pleasure to welcome the chairman of Barings Bank, Peter Baring. We may be the oldest merchant bank in the world, but that's no excuse for not keeping up with the times. When l became chairman, l realised we couldn't go on running Barings like a gentlemen's club. We had to look beyond our traditional recruiting grounds, the old school tie, to seek out a new and hungrier breed. We're beginning to see the fruits of those efforts, and l have to say, the recovery in profitability, since the reorganisation, has been amazing. To be frank, l've discovered it's not actually terribly difficult to make money in the securities business! Filled. Yeah, you paid  for 20.  Come in. Simon, er l've got a slight problem. One of the girls sold  contracts for Fuji Bank instead of buying. l can't do anything about it till Monday. What's the damage? 220, at the close. Sack the cow. She'll never work on SlMEX again. That's a bit hard, isn't it? Look, you handle it. Have a word with London, but make sure you make that client good. All right. Hey! Have a beer, shithead! Cheers. Hi, darling. Anyone seen Kim? She was here a minute ago. Kim Nick, Nick l'm really sorry. l got so confused.  Everybody was shouting all at once? That's the job. That's what it's all about, keeping a cool head. l'm so sorry! l'll pay you back the money. Sure, Kim. Four years' salary? And if the market moves it could be even worse. Come on, come on. Come on, everyone makes mistakes. Look, with a bit of luck l can trade out of it on Monday, all right? Nick, l've been waiting for you while everyone else is having a good time.  l'm going home now? Kim! Kim!  Everything all right? Never better. Why don't you let me come in and help? l can't sit around all day doing nothing. lt's not a problem, Lisa. l can handle it. Fernando, how are March futures looking?  l need  contracts at Friday's price? You won't get Friday's price! l should have closed off the position and taken the loss. lnstead, l waited for the market to change. lt changed all right, but not the way l wanted. Now l was stuck with a bigger loss than l could own up to. And it was all my fault. Nick! l hear your girl handed in her notice. Never came back. She couldn't stand the pace. So much for loyalty!  Did you make the client good? Of course. Made a small profit, actually. Good man. softly This one's for the five eights account. l bought the missing contracts. 660,000?  Shh!lt was only  before. And the market went the wrong way. l had to cut the loss. What did Simon Jones say? Are you serious? He'd shut us down if he knew. lt'll be all right so long as we balance the books by the end of the month.  How? We trade on our own account until we wipe out the losses, then we use money from the client account and pay it back with next month's profits. You mean, gamble? whispers Relax, Bonnie. That's all the market is. One giant casino! George! l was counting on nobody looking at the books until the end of each month. As long as the five eights account had a nil balance on the last day of the month, no one would suspect that anything was wrong. But instead of winning back the position we made more losses, and l had to borrow more money from the client account to hide them. Fuckin' hell, George, what are you playing at? Get fuckin' out! Get fuckin' out! Now! What the hell are you playing at? Out! Get out! Fuckin' hell!  Agh? God, you're tense. Stiff as a board. lf you only knew! All cos those bastards won't let me hire proper staff.  l thought it was going so well? lt is. lt's going brilliant. l just spend most of my life covering everybody else's arse. Well, why don't you let me help with the back office?  l'm bored being a lady of leisure? No. Why not? lt's ridiculous, you having to handle trading and settlements. You'll have a nervous breakdown. l don't want you interfering. l can handle it. All right, keep your pants on! No one's saying you can't. l'm not going back to being a bloody clerk. l'd rather be a plasterer. My mum always used to say l could be anything l wanted, so long as l took my chancesand worked like a dog. Well, you have. You've worked really hard and it paid off. She'd have been so proud of you. Do you really think so? Yeah. l know l am! That was the worst partLisa thinking l was this brilliant success. lf she only knew what a fuck-up l really was! When l wanted the market to go up, it went down. lf l wanted it to go down, it went up. lt was hard not to take it personally. Nick? Nick! l just worked out the balance in the eights account.  The losses are over $ million!Keep your fuckin' voice down! Look, there's no need to panic. There's not enough in the client account to make margin payments, Nick. softly Right. l need dollars. l need dollars to cover the initial margin payment! l can get dollars from London to cover all the client positions for the futures l buy! Nothing unusual about that. But l'm gonna need yen. Gonna need yen to cover the daily variation columns! Which'll leave a yen deficit by the end of the month. Unless unless l sell options. That'll generate commission in yen. And return the balance sheet on the five eights account to zero! As long as London kept sending out money to finance the client positions, l'd have enough cash to stay on top of the margin payments. lt was like robbing Peter to pay Paul, but hopefully l'd end up making enough to pay Peter back before he found out. Meanwhile l had to generate more and more business to justify my cash calls, and for that l needed customers. The bigger the better. Mm-hm. Oui. Bon, tres bien. Mr Leeson.  l'm Pierre Beaumarchais? Nice to meet you. l work for the Geneva Banking Trust, based in the Bahamas. l was speaking with Ang Swee Tian, president of SlMEX. He's impressed by the amount of business you've been generating.  There's a lot of opportunities here? Oh, yes. l do a lot of business on SlMEX. With the exception of George Soros, l probably trade in the Nikkei more than anyone. Sometimes over 5, contracts in a day. That is a lot. The whole market only does about 20. Could Barings handle that amount of business? You bet we could! Beaumarchais was the answer to my prayers. l'd be able to siphon off enough commission to square the eights account once and for all.  Hello? Pierre Beaumarchais. l want to buy 4, June contracts. l've got a price of 350, but this'll move it. Try not to pay more than 400. We gotta get them cheap. Beaumarchais is a big player. lf we pull this off, we get a shitload of business.  What's liquidity like? Tight as a flea's arse. We'll get away with 500, then the price will move up. OK. But then we'll make the other traders think we're sellers. And when the price drops buy! All right? OK. Sell 250! Sell 250! Sell 250! Sell 240! Sell 240! Sell 240! Sell 200! Sell 200!  Buy  contracts!Sell 200! Buy? Buy? Buy at 200! Buy at 200! Buy at 210! Buy at 210! Buy at 220! Buy at 220! Buy at 230! Buy at 240! Buy at 240! Buy at 240! Filled! Nobody saw us coming! We swooped on the first   like a Stealth bomber! 74, contracts! Balls of steel, Fat Boy. Balls of fuckin' steel! Andy Williams: ''Can't Take My Eyes Off You'' At last my luck had changed. Suddenly l couldn't stop making money. l was long in the Nikkeithat meant gambling on it going upand up it went. Up and up and up. That's very good! Very good. Serves you right, Lisa! lf it went all the way up to  9,000, l stood to make a killing on the options l'd sold. Come on, come on! Come on, baby, you can do it. Come on.  Yes!Yes! Bonnie, we're on a fuckin' roll! Yes! Do you think we'll do it? bell rings lt's amazing! You've made back all the losses.  Over $ million? What did l tell you? Oh, ye of little faith! You keep doubling up, and sooner or later you're bound to win. ''Jingle Bells'' The Nikkei has closed up for the third day in a row, and the rally shows little sign of running out of steam. Analysts are predicting additional gains in the days ahead. bulletin continues  Happy? Yeah. Are you? Never better. l have been sailing a bit close to the wind. l didn't want to worry you with it.  What do you mean? No, it's all right. The market turned round and a whole load of my positions came good. l made it all back. What are you on about, Nick? Don't get your knickers in a twist, but we made mistakes and ran up some losses. l went out on a limb to get back the position. How big were the losses?  lt's about a million? A million quid?! For God's sake, Nick! No, it's all right. lt paid off. l squared it up. l had to do it to protect the guys. Promise me that you'll never do that again.  lt's not worth it, Nick? l promise. You will give me a heart attack. they laugh  Merry Christmas? Merry Christmas. cheering Fuck off! l really meant it. l was the number one trader, and as the new year came in l was determined to kick my addiction to the eights account. What will the market do? Long-term? No one thinks long-term, they think nanoseconds!  Long-term's tomorrow morning? Tomorrow, then.  That would be telling? Leeson speaks, the market moves! You said it, mate. Pierre. l want to sell the  call options and buy the  calls in December. l've got an offer of .  for size. Can you do better? l'll get back to you. Quick as you can, Nick. l have to move fast. Oui, oui, je suis toujours la. What the hell is he on about, .  for size? The market in  calls is down. He wants to cut his losses.  Yeah, but why . 38?lt's a ratio. The  calls are trading at  ,400. Divide  by  ,400, you get . 43. All right. But not . 38. Unless someone's offered him a discount. Probably Societe Generale. We can't let those wankers get our biggest client.  What are you gonna do? Just have to leg it. Buy the contracts from Pierre and sell them when the market rises? l thought we were not supposed to trade for the bank. Pierre? l can do it. What's the exact size? 46,500? All right, leave it with me. No problem. What if the market doesn't rise, uh? What if it falls? l've gambled and won before. l can gamble and win again. Balls of steel, me old mateys, and you'd better believe it. Bonnie, l need you to reopen the eights account. We got caned on Beaumarchais' contracts. Now the bastard's gone back to Societe Generale. Fax Brenda Granger in London. Ask her for funds to cover the margin payments. Tell her it's for client positions.  Hello? lt's Simon. Can you come into my office? Right away. Christ, l'd been rumbled! The only surprise was it'd taken so long. What was l gonna tell Lisa? She'd bloody murder me.  Come in. Congratulations, Nick. The ' bonuses are in, and you're down for   grand.  35? That's fantastic! Your little operation generated profits of over  million last year. You're a star! ln fact, your figures are so high they're going to check up on you. Check up on me? They're sending Ash Lewis out for the audit. Don't worry. lt's purely routine. Ash Lewis? She's meant to be a right ball-breaker, isn't she? That's our booth. Filled! You paid 250. Hi, Nick. Ron Baker and Ash Lewis. Ron is head of Derivatives Trading in London. Which l guess makes me your boss, Nick.  How do you, Mr Leeson? Very well, thank you. OK. Let's see the action! Henry! Baker Who's doing all the business? We're the biggest, right? We do a lot of arbitrage, so we do have a high volume. We signal orders in to George in the pitthis is Henryand at the end of the day the girls in the office log all the deals on to the computer. Lewis You manage the trading floor and the settlements office, is that right? Yes, yes. That's a little unusual. Whatever happened to checks and balances?  That's something we need to talk about? l'll be here for three weeks. This is going to be a thoroughly comprehensive audit. No stone unturned. Absolutely. Anything l can do to help, any stone needs turning, let me know. Are we filled? Good man, Henry. Nice to see you, Simon. Dad's seen this flat in Blackheath. Needs a bit of work, but him and my granddad can fix it up. Think of it like an insurance policy in case you get sacked, have to go back to England and work as a plasterer!  What's up with you, misery-guts? What would you do, Lise? What would you do if l did get the elbow? You've just been given a ruddy great big bonus. But what if it all went wrong? What if l'm not as clever as everyone thinks? Oh, of course you are! Anyway, it's you l love. l don't give a toss about the money. lf it was up to me we'd jack it all in now, go back to England and start a family. You're doing brilliantly, Nick. You're a bloody star.  Nick! Fuck! Simon!  You're looking disgustingly chirpy? Haven't you heard? Panic over.  Ash has been called back to London? You're kidding. Why? Office politics. Some turf battle between Futures and Securities.  And what about the audit? They'll send Mark Taylor and Chris Carr. Compared to Ash they're a couple of pussies. Pity. l was rather looking forward to seeing the dreaded Ash Lewis in action! whispers Yes! No, l'm just leaving now. l'm gonna jump in the shower. lf you get home first, put the oven on.  All right, sweetheart. l'll see you then? Bye, darling. cackles  Get in, you bastard!What the fuck is that? Sex on wheels. lt's a Porsche, moron!

Jerry Lee Lewis: ''Great Balls Of Fire'' Whoo!  lt's a fuckin' one-way street, George? Whoops! Goodness, gracious, great balls of steel!  Whoo!Fuckin' George! Shit! There's that Reuters journalist. Nick! Nick! He's been bugging me for weeks for an interview.  Hey, Nick!All right, mate? Nick, my man. What'll you have? Oh, a beer, please. You know George Seow, one of my dealers? This is Danny from lntercontinental Trading.  Just been sent from the London office? Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you. l hear Barings have almost cornered the market here, thanks to you. The rumours have been greatly exaggerated. Don't be so modest. He's king of the exchange! Barings got an award for all the business he's generated.  Do you want a beer? l'd love a beer. Aagghh! canned laughter shouting, laughter music, drunken shouting Nick Watch the Drambuie settle. And it's called depth charge. lt's guaranteed to blow your fuckin' head off. Are you ready?

Outraging a lady's modesty very serious crime in Singapore. News of my disgrace reached London. At the highest level. lt's slightly embarrassing, but one of our traders got drunk and pulled a moon. What did you say? He exposed his bottom. laughter  Why? Playing silly buggers, l expect. Unfortunately, the law over there takes rather a dim view. Maybe we should sack him. Sacking him would be awkward, to say the least. He generates a significant amount of our profits in Southeast Asia. l, er ought to mention we're getting stick from the Bank of England about our funding over there. Technically we're in breach of regulations on the ratio of lending to capital. Would you like me to have a quiet word in their ear? Oh, we're not quite there yet. When l spoke to Andy Dixon at the Bank, he said the matter was ''buried reasonably deep in his in-tray''. Just flagging a concern. Quite right. lt's something we should keep an eye on. Well is that it? Any other business? Well, what about this chap Leeson? He of the exhibitionist tendencies. l suppose it's something we should leave to the Singapore authorities. l have to say l'm inclined to agree. So, it was the profits that saved me. lf they only knew! Nick! That guy from Reuters again. The second time today. Tell him l've Oh, fuck it! Gimme the phone. Print me up a balance on the eights account. Hi, Loy. Nick! You're a hard man to pin down. You know how it is. What can l do you for?  Quite a position you've been buying?

Then print me a new report after that entry so it shows 7. billion yen  ..as if it was owing to us from SlMEX? Sure, Nick. Then fax Brenda Granger in London, asking for more funds. Say we've had a large margin call on our client positions. How much? A million. Make it two. phone rings  Nick!Mm? Nick, it's the phone.  Hello? l'm not disturbing you, am l? lt's am. Oh, Christ. Sorry, mate. Had no idea. The old farts are getting nervous. They want you to unwind the position a little. That's easier said than done. Don't want to send the wrong signal to the market. Yeah, yeah. Second, we need another  million profit by next month to secure our bonuses. Two million? Ron, what planet do you live on, mate? One minute you want me to unwind the positions Failure is not an option, mate. See you at the junket in London in three weeks' time.  million? Who do they think l am, George Soros?

Listen, with this conference you'll be away from the trading floor a long time. l had to come back a week early for this funeral.  l told you, Lisa's granddad passed away? l'm sorry about that, mate, but l'm fighting for your bonus. You need to keep up those profits.  l couldn't miss this funeral? No one's asking you to! l'll issue you a pass so you can come in on Sunday and trade through the night. You won't miss a thing! Get out the fuckin' way! lf he's working this hard he's going to need his food. He wants me to go into the office on Sunday night and trade. Well no! That's completely out of order. Let someone else make the profits! She's right, Nick. You're not a machine. lt's bonus time. lf l don't deliver, then everybody loses out. lt's not fair, Nick. You carry on at this rate, you're gonna be in a right old state. lt's gonna be your funeral next. For as much as it hath pleased almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed, we therefore commit his body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Good to see you, son. Sorry occasion, but there you go.  He had a good innings? That's the main thing. So how's it going over there?  Can't complain?

Don't pay any attention to me. lift pings l felt sick going into the office, seeing all the people l'd been avoiding for months. lt was one thing to con people over the phone, quite another to do it to their face.

Nobody out there can answer our questions but you. And they just asked for another ton of funding.  All right. This one? Yeah. Brenda was my cash lifeline. She was the last person l wanted asking awkward questions. But first l had to deal with Peter Norris. He's such a red-hot trader l'm having him come in overnight! Are you really? You can't keep Nick away from the floor. He's the key man in Singapore. Sounds like you're the key man in Asia. He's insane! You should see how he takes that market on.  Are you enjoying yourself? Yes, it's all right. both ''All right''? they laugh Now, we need to talk about merging the sales areas in Asia. Nick has some views. lf we can replicate his success in Hong Kong and Tokyo What do you think, Nick? lt does make a lot of sense to merge. There would need to be controls, of course, but the trading books can be used to supplement a customer's requirements and increase information flows. Synergetically. Exactly. Synergy. So you see, Peter, Nick agrees. And he's been very successful with his customers. They love him! Yes, excellent. Well, keep up the good work, and Ron, you sort out what you want with this merger.

Well, can't you get the bonus in London? Please, Nick! l wanna get on with my life. l wanna start a family. l'm going stir-crazy here all on my own! Calm down. Look, l just need a bit more time to sort things out, turn things around. No! You're up at dawn and then you come back at night and collapse into bed How am l meant to get pregnant again if we never make love? l know. But this could set us up for life!  When's bonus day? th of February. Just five weeks to go. Right, we're gonna leave on the th. l mean it. l'm calling the furniture removers tomorrow. All right. All right. With everything else closing in on me, l'd forgotten about the mooning charge. When it finally came up, l was facing a possible jail sentence. The charge has been reduced to a misdemeanour. The maximum penalty is a $ fine. l think we should plead guilty. Thank you very much. lt was uncanny. l'd got away with it again! To the Singapore legal system, a shining example to the free world! We bared our all for Barings. Bearer bonds takes on a whole new meaning after this! phone rings Talk about a bear market! Hello? Mooners Anonymous. This is Wei Wei from Coopers & Lybrand. ls that Nick? Speaking. l'm compiling the end-of-year audit. There seems to be a big hole in the accounts. l'm missing the 7. billion yen receivable from SlMEX. Nick, can you hear me? ls everything all right? lt's a little complicated. What do you need? l can't find any paperwork. lt was an over-the-counter trade between Speer, Leads and Kellagg and Barings London. lt fell through the computer system. l'll have a word with the systems manager. l need three bits of paper. One: confirmation from SLK that the 7. billion yen will be paid. Two: sight of your bank balance to show it's been received. And three: a note from Ron Baker saying he's aware of the deal and approves it. line goes dead Well? Oh, it's just a computer glitch. They're doing their annual audit. laughs And so, with scissors and paste, l created $ million out of thin air. This was forgery, pure and simple, and there was no going back.  Nick!Simon. Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack!  What's this missing seven billion yen? Oh, that's a nightmare. lt's an OTC trade that was incorrectly booked. The auditors are really on my case about it. lt's a pain in the arse, but we've got to get it sorted. The point is, we're owed the money by SLK. Who the hell are SLK? Speer, Leads and Kellagg. lt's a brokerage house. Better send me a memo as soon as. Get these auditors off my back. Sure, Simon. Don't worry, l'm onto it. phone rings Bonnie, it's Nick. Listen. Listen very carefully. Transfer 7. billion yen from the client account to the house account tomorrow. But it won't go! There isn't enough money. l know that, but then you can reverse it. lt's just an electronic transaction. But l want the transfer done. And l want the bank to send us a fax of the statement, showing the 7. billion yen credit. All right, Nick. lf you say so. Cheers, Bonnie. Nick? What's all this about seven billion yen? Someone from London, Tony Hawes, was looking for you. Jesus Christ, if l hear any more about this seven billion yen lt's about $ million, innit? What do you reckon? Red or blue? You think l just walked off with $ million? l didn't say that. lt's a computer error. You need someone in the back office, l told you. You're not bloomin' Superman! Don't start all that again. lt wouldn't have happened if l'd been there. Right. l'm goin' out.  Where are you going? To get pissed. lf anyone calls, tell 'em l've gone to South America. Well, you can bloody stay there, then! Twat! key in door What have you done now, Leeson? What have you done now?  Come in. l thought you'd like to know the audit's been cleared.  Nick sent the papers. Everyone's happy? Thanks, Ron. Technically we've breached SlMEX rules, but it was just a non-transaction. With any luck the auditors won't mention it, or we may have problems with the local regulator. Sounds sensible. Do you know, Nick made $ million doing arbitrage in a week? That's about half a billion dollars a year. The guy's a turbo arbitrageur! lf he's doing that amount of business for that amount of profit, why don't we shut down the rest of the bank? We're just overhead. Yeah! phone rings  Hello? Nick, are you avoiding me? l've been trying you for days. Sorry, Tony, it's been chaos. The audit went through. l thought you knew.  lt's this SLK thing? lt's all been cleared up. l know. What's bothering me is where you got all the money to actually well, pay SLK in the first place. l mean, it's the equivalent of $ million! lt doesn't add up, you know. lt's obvious. lt's part of the funding we've had from you over the past few weeks. Yes. So, the same figure will flow back to you. l see. You're saying that some of the funding was used to pay SLK? That's right, Tony. So we'll be able to pay it back to you. That'll be good. Er getting our funding down will be good. l'm having to juggle quite a few balls. We all are, Tony. Look, l've got to dash. l've got company for dinner.  Of course. Thanks, Nick. Thanks for clearing that up. phone rings Yes, Ron. What do you want? lt's me, you wanker! Danny. Bubble? What are you doing calling me in the middle of the night? Are you anywhere near a TV? l suggest you tune in to CNN. The worst damage was in the seaport of Kobe. Road and rail links are shattered Jesus, an earthquake! That's all we fuckin' need. This is gonna kill the market, man. The Nikkei's gonna fall through the fuckin' floor! milling around in search of help. Rescue operations are going to be complicated, long and expensive. Mike Chinoy, CNN, reporting live from Tokyo. uproar Market's down  points, you stand there cool as a fuckin' cucumber. The way l see it, it's an opportunity. l'm gonna buy into the market. Buy it all the way back up to  9,000. Oi! Fuckin' true what they say about your gonads, mate. See what l mean? Think l'll give Fernando a bell in Tokyo, see what's shakin'. No pun intended. lt's Nick. What's the situation in Kobe? We've been trying to contact our friends, but the lines are down. Hold it a second. We got movement. Holy shit, selling! There's some selling! Fuckin' hell, it's in free fall! l've never seen it move so fast. 03350! 350! 03350! Nick? Sure you don't want us to stay? No, l l'm fine. You go. You'll make it right, Nick. We all believe in you.  million! l, Nicholas Leeson, have lost  million quid in one day! What does he do, exactly? That's what no one seems able to explain. lt's simple. He switches contracts between Osaka and SlMEX, exploiting price differentials between the two markets. That's how he offers the best deals to our customers. lf it's that easy, why isn't everybody doing it? Because he's absolutely in the vortex of the information curve over there. He's discovered a whole new way of making money. Well, he's giving us horrendous funding problems, that's all l know. He doesn't do things by the book, Ron. He just doesn't respect the rules. ls he really the kind of person we should be employing at Barings? Oh, fuck the rules. lt's barrow boys like Nick who are turning the City around. You can't run a modern financial centre with a bunch of Hooray Henries. Bastard! Wakey-wakey!  What's the action, mate? You tell me. The market's up and down like a tart's knickers.  l think the worst is over? Who knows? You could be right. Well, that's my hunch anyway. Listen, l was out last night with that Loy. You know, that journo from Reuters. He's convinced there's no mystery customer. He reckons it's you. He thinks you're trading on your own account. Without the bank's approval. Now, you're not that crazy, are you? What do you think? Who, then? Beaumarchais? l thought he'd given you the elbow.  l can't tell you? Come on. lt's me, Danny Boy! l could tell you but l'd have to shoot you afterwards. l know one thing. lf Customer X didn't exist, you'd have to invent him.  million? You've already had  this week. Everybody's had an advance margin call from SlMEX on their client positions. They're worried about stability with these big movements. lt's an emergency measure(? lsn't everybody squealing out there? No, we'll get it back when the market calms down. Nick, when are you gonna reduce these positions? The bean counters are freakin' out! Ron! Didn't know you were there. For fuck's sake, we've had the Bank of lnternational Settlements asking if Barings can meet its margin payments!  lt is not good for the image!l hear you, Ron. lt's a tight market. Yeah, well, you've really gotta try. Take a hit on it if you have to. l know Norris is gonna want to discuss it with you when he's out there next week. Norris?  l didn't know he was coming? Yeah, with Tony Hawes. They want to check the numbers. lron out these funding problems once and for all! thunder There was no way l could reduce my positions without the market collapsing. By the time they got to Singapore l was in deeper than ever, faxing Brenda daily, 30,  million dollars at a time. They were gonna kill me. Lookin' like shit, Nick. Lookin' like fuckin' shit, mate.  Good evening, sir? Good evening. laughter and chat Hawes His approach shot sliced into the woods  Nick. There you are? l'm sorry l'm a little bit late.  What'll you have? A beer would be great, thanks. Another Tiger, please. Nick  How was the market today? lt stayed between 18, and 18,300. lt's settled after the earthquake. Happy with the positions you're running? l'm relaxed. They're March contracts, so l'll let them expire.  Good? Thanks. Now, we've had a lot of stick over funding. Brenda Granger tells me we're borrowing all over Japan to get the funds to you. People are beginning to talk, Nick. l understand. l understand completely. Excellent. Good man. And that was it. That was apparently all he had to say on the subject of my enormous exposure causing so many ulcers throughout Barings. Better than you get in London, that's for sure! You'll enjoy the next course.  Lobster, sir? No, thanks. l'm not very hungry. l should have been able to relax after that, but l couldn't stop thinking about the losses in the five eights account. Shame you can't stay for the match on Saturday. voices echo Hawes You're down for 450, aren't you? Your bonus. Only a week to go. Sorry? Have you thought about what you're going to do with it? Only a week to go! Ahem! Excuse me. l have an announcement to make. l know that some of you are worried about our exposure in the market, and you're probably wondering about the identity of our mystery Customer X. Well, the fact is he doesn't exist. We are the customer: Barings. Look properly at the five eights accountwhich is not a client account, it's an errors accountand you'll realise it's concealing losses in the region of  million. No, l tell a lie. lt's more like  after today! What are you going to do with all that money, Nick? Well, l won't spend it on futures and options!  That's very good? Very good. l was living from day to day, hoping for a miracle. l wasn't running a position any more. The position was running me. Man, look at the state you're in. You got the bloody shakes!  You been on the razz all night? Nah.  l'm just getting killed by the market? Tell me about it! l've had a shitty week too. Penguin? You lucky sod! Do you know how rare they are? Do you know?  lt ain't that bloody funny!Lucky Leeson(! You have it. l'm not laughing at you, Bubble. Fuck! Sorry. 16'Ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! You really are in a bad way, ain't ya? What's the matter? l have an unauthorised position. Fuckin' hell. How big? Big enough to be a problem. Poor bastard! l can't say it comes as a complete surprise.  Does Lisa know? No, she'd kill me. She's got enough on her plate. She's just waiting for my bonus so we can go home! So what are you gonna do? Well l just have to keep buying futures to support the market. lf it sticks at 18,000, my options are still in the moneyl could get the position back.  l may even come out ahead? Nick You listen to me now, right. You don't fight the market, man. Even if you can make the margin calls, what happens when the contracts expire? The way the market's going, your losses could be catastrophic! Five for a thousand, five for a thousand! Come on! George, move this fuckin' market! lf it stays below 18, we're dead! Come on! Nick.  Nick!Tony. Nick, l really need to go over some of the figures with you. Sure, Tony. Back in a minute. Seven for five! Seven for five! l'm sorry. Money! l'd thrown away countless more millions, and it hadn't made a dent. l was only one day from bonus day, but the game was up. l was beaten. Oh, Nick, you're a bloody fool, aren't you? Well, it's not the end of the world. You've got your health, you've got me Shame about the bonus. Sorry. Slow down. The video shop's on the next left.  l wanna get our deposit back? Right. We're gonna need it, darlin'. phone rings  Hello? The positions have got bigger! lf they aren't reduced l'm coming out there to sort you out!  You're very faint, Ron? And what's this rumour l hear? There's a rumour that we're the customer. Sorry, you're gonna have to speak up. Tell me we're not the customer, Nick.  l'm losing you, Ron? Nick! Nick, are you there? Goodbye, Ron. They wouldn't give me the full 200, but l stood my ground and got 180. Good girl. Nick! phone rings Excuse me, sir. There's a phone call for you.  Not now? lt's Peter Norris. He said it's urgent. Oh. Thank you. Would you excuse me? Peter? l'm sorry to drag you away from your dinner party. l'm afraid l've got some rather bad news. By the time the shit hit the proverbial fan in London we'd escaped Singapore to ponder the future and consider my options. lf l had any. What's gonna happen, Nick? They must have got my fax and closed down all the positions on Friday. The market seems to be holding up OK. But you're definitely out of a job? lt could have been a lot worse, but l still lost them a ton of money. l'm starving! Think they do burgers here? laughs No! You're not having a burger.  That tummy of yours is driving me nuts? Don't stress me, wench! laughs l'll work it off in the gym. Better still kissing  Stop it. People are watching? So? l don't care. Come here, girl. Jesus Christ, Lisa!  Barings has gone bust!What?! The Chancellor of the Exchequer is trying to calm fears sparked by the failure of Barings Bank. ln a statement to Parliament he denied reports that the British banking system is about to collapse. According to him, Barings' failure is a unique situation, which he blames on the actions of a rogue trader in Singapore. Estimates of potential losses range from  million to over one billion pounds. There's no way of knowing how markets will react when they reopen on Monday. As the Bank of England tries to put together a rescue package, with the Sultan of Brunei rumoured as a buyer, time may be running out for one of Britain's most venerable financial institutions. Charles Samson, CNN, London. whispers Fuck! Oh, Nick! How could you not tell me? How could you have kept it hidden for all this time, Nick? You must have been through hell! You would have marched me straight into Simon Jones's office.  Too bloody right!Then l'd have got fired, and l couldn't have made the money back. That's all l was gonna do. No, but you were gambling. That's what you were doing. With other people's money. l didn't want to let everyone down. You, my dad, the girls in the office Even Ron bloody Baker! Do you think they're all gonna hate me now? Well, l don't think you're gonna be Mr Popular! lt could easily have been the other way, you know. lt so nearly was. Then l'd be a hero. Oh! whispers Come here. Come here. l still love ya. Mm?   l love you very much? l love you too. Shall we see if l can do something about that belly? l see. Yes, l understand. No, of course. Thank you again for your efforts. Goodbye. That was the Sultan of Brunei's office. They have decided not to proceed. They believe the risks are too great and the time too short, in view of the need to have a rescue package ready by the time markets open again in the Far East. ls there really no one else? We've tried everyone. lt's hopeless. l therefore have to inform you that Barings is insolvent and will go into immediate liquidation. sobs Peter Barings has gone on TV and said there's been a conspiracy. They've lost  million quid! l lost nowhere near that. lt was more like 300! But Barings didn't do anything Friday. Now the word's out, the market's crashed. Bloody idiots! They think you've run off on your yacht.  What?!l know. But listen, mate. You've got no friends here now, so just get the fuck out of Asia. Get back to London, Australia, anywhere. Just get out. We're tryin'. Oi, Nick get yourself a good lawyer.  Be lucky? Cheers, mate. Tannoy Flight   to Hong Kong leaving from gate two. Fuck! There's a manhunt all over Asia. They think we're sailing around in our yacht!  What bloody yacht? l know. What about the flights?  There's one to London. Via Singapore? That's no good. There's a flight to Frankfurt. Via Abu Dhabi. Let's take it. And Lisa Pay cash.  Newspaper, sir? No, thank you.  Ma'am? Er no, thanks. Nick, take that thing off. There's a guy over there lookin' at me. l'm not surprised, with that bloody hat on! Talk about conspicuous! You're sticking out like a sore bloody thumb. Did you say we stop at Abu Dhabi? Yeah.  That's where they cut your hands off? Oh, don't be ridiculous! They just stone you. What? l'm sorry, but you've gotta laugh! Poor old Barings, eh? That's what you get for hiring the wrong sort of person. That was when it hit methe enormity of what l'd done. Whatever happened, l knew things were never gonna be the same again. And l've never felt lonelier in all my life. l love you, Lisa. Whatever happens, l love you. l love you too. l've got to get back to London. l couldn't stand being in jail in Singapore. l couldn't stand it if l couldn't see you. Jesus Christ, it's the police! They must know l'm on the flight. Well no, not necessarily. Due to our early arrival, passport control will take place as you leave the plane. Please have your documents ready. See? l'm scared, Lisa! You be strong, OK? Danke. Pass, bitte. Danke. Thank you. Please show your passport. Where is your man? l'm her man. uproar  bid on 100!  bid on 100! Come on! Who wants some of that?  bid on 100!  bid on 100! Come on! Aria from Mozart's ''The Magic Flute'' And that's it, more or less. That's the end of my story. Barings was eventually sold to the Dutch bank lNG for the princely sum of 1. Lisa's got a new life as a flight attendant for Virgin Atlantic. l hear she's got herself a new fella. As for me, l fought unsuccessfully against extradition from Frankfurt to Singapore on charges of fraud, forgery and breach of trust. l was sentenced to six and a half years in prison. Despite rumours of secret bank accounts and hidden millions, l did not profit personally from my unlawful trading. To be absolutely honest, sometimes l wish l had. l've got something to say We have come a long way After all the things that we have been through l'm glad still to have you l know you're hurtin' And though you're hurtin' lt will get better every day l love all that you are You are what l live for After all the things that we have been through l'm glad still to have you l know you're hurtin' And though you're hurtin' lt will get better every day\")]}"
