1
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,423
Your breakfast, sir.

2
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:23,193
Pork bellies! I have a hunch
something exciting is going to happen

3
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,953
in the pork belly market this morning.

4
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,742
Will Miss Penelope
be dining with you this evening, sir?

5
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,776
Yes. Yes, she will.

6
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:30,444
- Good morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning, Folsey.

7
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:42,435
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Good morning.

8
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:44,945
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning.

9
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:48,726
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning.

10
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:51,593
Good morning, Mr Winthorpe.

11
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,905
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.

12
00:05:58,006 --> 00:06:00,395
- Good morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning.

13
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,651
- Good morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning.

14
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:27,088
Pork bellies. I knew it. I knew it!

15
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:47,468
- Good morning, Mr Duke.
- Good morning, Mr Duke.

16
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:51,825
- Good morning, Mr Duke.
- Morning, Mr Duke.

17
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,901
- Morning, Mr Duke.
- Morning, Mr Duke.

18
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:58,113
- Mr Duke.
- Good morning, Mr Duke.

19
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:00,358
Good morning, Mr Duke.

20
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:34,021
When do we sell?

21
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:37,631
How stupid these scientists are!

22
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:41,905
The eternal question! There is no question.
The answer's obvious.

23
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,484
I don't care about
heredity versus environment.

24
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:49,747
I'm sick and tired of hearing it. I care
how much we get for our pork bellies.

25
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:52,042
Winthorpe will sell
at 76 and a quarter.

26
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:54,776
His charts say that's as high as it'll go.

27
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:58,287
It'll never get that high. Let's sell now.

28
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,591
Patience, Mortimer.
Let's see if Winthorpe's right.

29
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,550
Winthorpe's wrong. It's topped out.
I say we sell now.

30
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,459
- Just another few seconds.
- The market's closing.

31
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,212
We won't get the order in.

32
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,129
We just made an extra $347,000.

33
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:37,775
Get me Winthorpe.

34
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:41,530
Well, I never had an instant
of doubt in my mind, Mortimer.

35
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:45,731
Yes, I'm sure a lot of people
went belly-up on that one.

36
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:48,022
I'll see you at the club.

37
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:19,892
Morning Mr Duke.

38
00:09:20,112 --> 00:09:23,343
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Thank you very much.

39
00:09:23,616 --> 00:09:26,653
Vietnam did this to me
but I'm not bitter, thank you.

40
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:29,949
Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukkah?

41
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:32,880
Spare a poor war veteran some change?
I'm on my knees for life.

42
00:09:33,127 --> 00:09:35,083
I have no money to give you.

43
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:37,048
Please, anything.

44
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:39,817
A quarter, just a couple of dollars.

45
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:42,725
Anything, a quarter, a nickel, please.

46
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:45,167
Hey, man, I really don't appreciate this.

47
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:49,225
I don't care what it is,
smoked ham, anything, a jacket.

48
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:52,513
Thanks! How'd you
like a stump up your ass?

49
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:56,165
- Stay outta here!
- You've got a lot of soul. I appreciate it.

50
00:10:01,743 --> 00:10:03,734
Listen to this.

51
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:05,945
"Expect this stagnation to continue,

52
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:08,156
"until the Department Of Agriculture's

53
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:10,492
January crop report."

54
00:10:10,712 --> 00:10:13,909
Exactly as we thought, Randolph.

55
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:17,484
Wrong! Quite wrong. Untrue.

56
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:19,752
They've given this genetics fellow

57
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:23,362
the Nobel Prize. He doesn't know
the first thing about human nature.

58
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:27,841
We're about to make
millions of dollars in frozen orange juice

59
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:30,139
and you're talking about human nature.

60
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:32,111
Money isn't everything.

61
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,435
Grow up.

62
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:36,002
Mother always said you were greedy.

63
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:38,038
She meant it as a compliment.

64
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,953
Ezra, right on time.

65
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:51,815
I bet you thought
I'd forgotten your Christmas bonus.

66
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:54,083
There you are.

67
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:58,892
Five dollars!
Maybe I'll go to the movies…

68
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:02,229
by myself.

69
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:06,631
- Half of it is from me.
- Thank you, Mr Mortimer.

70
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:21,379
- Gentlemen.
- Looking good, Louis.

71
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:23,264
Feeling good, Todd.

72
00:11:23,462 --> 00:11:26,977
We need a fourth for squash today, Louis.
Are you interested?

73
00:11:27,258 --> 00:11:30,455
No can do. I'll be having dinner
with Penelope, tonight.

74
00:11:31,513 --> 00:11:36,382
- Oh, lucky you.
- It's not luck, Todd.

75
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:49,063
Randolph, Mortimer.

76
00:11:49,283 --> 00:11:51,513
What have you got for us?

77
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,814
It's that time of the month again.

78
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:57,872
Payroll cheques for our employees,
which require your signatures.

79
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:00,523
And no forgetting to sign the big ones.

80
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:04,190
We are paying some of our employees
an awful lot of money.

81
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,856
You can't get around
the minimum wage.

82
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:19,196
$50,000 to Clarence Beeks!
Who the hell…

83
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:24,831
I meant to ask you about that.
I went through our records,

84
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:28,313
and there doesn't seem to be
a Clarence Beeks employed with the firm.

85
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,005
Oh, Clarence Beeks.
Yes, of course.

86
00:12:34,293 --> 00:12:38,650
- He's doing something top secret for us.
- Research.

87
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:42,332
How is Penelope?

88
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:46,431
Don't forget she's our grandniece - you'd
better make an honest woman of her.

89
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,717
Well, I'll certainly try, sir.
The wedding invitations go out this week.

90
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,931
Good. Good work, Winthorpe.

91
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,038
Don't worry about this,
Winthorpe.

92
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,110
I'll take care of this one personally.

93
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,522
- Goodbye, Winthorpe.
- Goodbye, Winthorpe.

94
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:19,526
Winthorpe is a very steady young man.

95
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:22,480
We're lucky
to have him managing our firm.

96
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:27,558
Oh, hogwash. Exeter, Harvard -
he's the product of good environment.

97
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:30,490
It's got nothing to do with environment.

98
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:34,122
With his genes, you could put him
anywhere and he'd come out on top.

99
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:37,918
Breeding, same as in race horses.
It's in the blood.

100
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,099
Hey, baby, what's happening?
How you doing?

101
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:54,377
Once you've had a man with no legs,
you never go back.

102
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:57,668
I know what you're thinking.
You seen "Porgy And Bess"?

103
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,239
We can make it, baby. Me and you.

104
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,959
You bitch!

105
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:18,836
- Who's that? Who's there?
- Police!

106
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,311
We've had complaints about con men
pretending to be blind and crippled.

107
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:27,221
I ain't seen nothing since
I stepped on that landmine in Vietnam.

108
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:29,497
It was very painful.

109
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:32,106
You were in 'Nam? So were we. Where?

110
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:35,178
I was in… Sang Bang…

111
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:36,830
Dang Gong…

112
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:39,485
I was all over the place, a lot of places.

113
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:41,161
What unit?

114
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:44,472
I was with the Green Berets,
Special Unit Battalions…

115
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:49,205
Commando Airborne Tactics…
Specialist Tactics Unit Battalion.

116
00:14:49,531 --> 00:14:50,884
Yeah, it was real hush hush.

117
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:54,430
I was Agent Orange,
Special Agent Orange, that was me.

118
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:56,694
Airborne, huh?

119
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,296
I can see! I can see!

120
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:11,343
I have… I have legs.

121
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:14,707
I have… Oh shit, look at this.
Legs! I can walk.

122
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:17,696
Jesus, praise Jesus.

123
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:22,329
I appreciate this. Oh, this is beautiful.
I can't believe… Thank you.

124
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:24,529
I don't know what to do it's…

125
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:28,901
Glory be to God. Praise Jesus.
Look at me.

126
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:31,590
This is too much. I can't believe it.

127
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:36,857
Ah, beautiful. Listen… I can't thank you.
First Moses, now this. God, Jesus…

128
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,520
I'm so happy, oh God.
Look at me, this is too much.

129
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:43,631
What a happy day!

130
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,763
Really, I appreciate it.
Y'alls OK now. Look at this.

131
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:50,801
I can walk. I don't know what to say…
I'll be all right. Take it easy.

132
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:54,696
Y'all beautiful,
both of you are, the two of you.

133
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:04,810
How are you doing?

134
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:14,481
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Stop thief.

135
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:17,306
- Help, help!
- What are you talking about, man?

136
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:20,824
Don't kill me, take it, please.
I'm getting married.

137
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:23,654
- I don't want your bag.
- Help! Help!

138
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:26,960
Help! Help!

139
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:29,217
Help!

140
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:31,955
He's in there. After him.

141
00:16:35,903 --> 00:16:39,418
- Excuse me.
- Watch out. He probably has a weapon.

142
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,580
Stop him. He has my briefcase.

143
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:47,947
He's inside. That guy's crazy.

144
00:16:52,338 --> 00:16:54,329
He's getting away.

145
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,665
There he is. That's him. Get him.

146
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:59,763
He's under the table.
Somebody go under there.

147
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:02,005
Right there. There he is.

148
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:08,526
Is there a problem, officers?

149
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:18,967
What in heaven's name is going on here?

150
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:23,798
- He tried to rob the payroll, Randolph.
- I didn't, he bumped into me.

151
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,844
I did not.
You tried to grab my briefcase.

152
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:29,884
- It was an accident.
- An accident, really?

153
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:32,691
- What will happen to him?
- We'll book him

154
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:36,123
on assault, robbery, and resisting arrest.

155
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,664
Well done, Winthorpe.

156
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,486
I'm innocent.
I was trying to give his briefcase back.

157
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,205
I can't go to jail cos of some ass-wipe.

158
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:47,955
Officer, I would like to press
full charges.

159
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:50,662
People like this are a menace
to decent society.

160
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:53,419
You're from a broken home of course?

161
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:55,535
Yeah, it was broke. So what?

162
00:17:55,744 --> 00:17:58,577
You have a history of juvenile arrests,
I presume?

163
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:01,982
Drug abuse, reform school,
state prisons and all that-

164
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:05,210
I want a lawyer.
Is there a lawyer in the house?

165
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:15,748
That man is a product
of a poor environment.

166
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:18,406
There's nothing wrong with him,
I can prove it.

167
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,887
Of course there's
something wrong with him…

168
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:24,219
He's a Negro!

169
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:27,675
He's probably been stealing
since he could crawl.

170
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:44,330
Given the right
surroundings and encouragement,

171
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:50,136
I'll bet that that man could run
our company as well as Winthorpe.

172
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:53,385
Are we talking about a wager, Randolph?

173
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:59,404
I suppose you think Winthorpe…
say if he were to lose his job,

174
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:02,365
would resort
to holding up people on the streets.

175
00:19:02,612 --> 00:19:06,287
No, I don't think that
would be enough for Winthorpe.

176
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:11,854
We'd have to heap a little more
misfortune on those narrow shoulders.

177
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:15,221
If he lost his job and his home

178
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,974
and his fiancée and his friends.

179
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:21,967
If he were somehow disgraced
and arrested by the police

180
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,251
and thrown in jail, even.

181
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,514
Yes, I'm sure he'd take to crime
like a fish to water.

182
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,440
You'd have to put him in the wrong
surroundings, with the worst sort of people.

183
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:38,164
I mean real scum, Randolph.

184
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,436
We've done it before.

185
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,170
This time it's in a good cause.

186
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:46,109
How much do you want to bet?

187
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:48,923
- The usual amount.
- Why not?

188
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:57,205
You're so brave, Louis.

189
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:59,617
Someone has to take a stand
against criminals.

190
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:02,039
But he could have killed you.

191
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:06,735
In such a situation, you have
no time to think - instinct takes over.

192
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:09,894
It's either kill or be killed.

193
00:20:13,694 --> 00:20:15,810
Did Louis tell you what he did today?

194
00:20:17,323 --> 00:20:22,761
Mr Louis kindly shared this afternoon's
excitement with me, Miss Penelope.

195
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:27,804
You're so hot tempered, darling.

196
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:33,481
I would have grovelled
and begged for mercy.

197
00:20:41,267 --> 00:20:43,576
I want you Louis, now.

198
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:50,015
- Coleman.
- Sir?

199
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,357
We'll take our drinks in the living room,
by the fire.

200
00:20:55,825 --> 00:20:59,374
- No dessert, sir?
- You have it.

201
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:03,496
Thank you, sir.

202
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,478
Hello.

203
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:17,919
Oh, hello Mr Duke, sir…
A what?

204
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,988
A scientific experiment.

205
00:21:23,232 --> 00:21:25,302
Not at all, sir, no I…

206
00:21:25,526 --> 00:21:27,994
It all sounds very…

207
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:30,937
…original.

208
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:34,964
Well, it's your house and I work for you.

209
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:37,998
I shall make the necessary arrangements.

210
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,528
And a very good night to you, sir.

211
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:47,665
What a scumbag.

212
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:52,386
Mumsie wants to have a party for us
right after New Year's.

213
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:55,071
January 2nd, is that good for you?

214
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,302
OK with me, hon. Darn nice of her too.

215
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:01,203
Oh, heck. 2nd January. Can't do it.

216
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:04,798
- Oh, Louis.
- It's the day the crop reports come out.

217
00:22:05,697 --> 00:22:10,725
What do those stupid old crop reports
have to do with Mumsie's party?

218
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:14,036
It's the busiest time
of year in the office, sugarpuff.

219
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,283
It's just not fair. Why can't you
make them do it another day?

220
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:22,466
The Department Of Agriculture gets those
estimates from all over the country.

221
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,749
Pork bellies, soybeans,

222
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,846
frozen orange juice.

223
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,774
I'll just have to ask Todd to take me.

224
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:34,810
Now, wait just a minute. If you think
I'm going to let that playboy…

225
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:37,256
Just teasing you.

226
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:39,599
You know something, Witherspoon?

227
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:43,653
- What?
- We are going to make a great couple.

228
00:22:43,949 --> 00:22:46,463
We're going to have a great life.

229
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:51,010
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?

230
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:54,525
Will you be needing me any more,
this evening, sir?

231
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:59,542
No, I think I have everything I want.

232
00:23:00,343 --> 00:23:02,140
Good night, sir.

233
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:14,328
I had to keep him
under surveillance.

234
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:18,196
I had to make sure
he had his payroll before I made my move.

235
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:21,561
- Tell us how you cut him.
- With no knife.

236
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:25,978
- You told me you cut the dude.
- With these I cut him.

237
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:29,679
I am a chain belt in Kung Fu.
Bruce Lee was my teacher.

238
00:23:54,363 --> 00:23:58,834
That's the "quart of blood" technique. Do
it, a quart of blood drops out of a body.

239
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,199
- Tell him how you beat on the cop.
- Cops, plural.

240
00:24:03,498 --> 00:24:07,810
Beat the shit out of ten cops and had
to change my whole strategy around.

241
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:12,520
When they brought you in and booked you,
you was crying like a pussy.

242
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:17,632
- Yeah.
- The cops threw tear gas in my face.

243
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:21,602
I still walked in like a man,
so get outta my face.

244
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:25,045
You beating up a man,
putting him in hospital.

245
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:27,704
- How come I don't see marks on you?
- Yeah.

246
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:30,252
Cos I'm a karate man, all right.

247
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:34,037
Karate men bruise on the inside
They don't show their weaknesses.

248
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:38,238
You don't know that, motherfucker.
Now get off my back, all right.

249
00:24:39,414 --> 00:24:42,850
I wish my bitches would hurry up.
I ain't got time to be here.

250
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:46,119
Where is your bitches,
Mr Big Time Pimp?

251
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:47,655
Yeah.

252
00:24:50,844 --> 00:24:54,120
Didn't I tell you,
the phone in my limousine is busted

253
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,381
and I can't get in contact
with my bitches.

254
00:24:57,227 --> 00:25:00,139
Yeah, the phone in the limo had busted.
Are you ignorant?

255
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,819
- Look, sit down, all right.
- Lt ain't cool being no jive turkey

256
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:08,228
so close to Thanksgiving.

257
00:25:12,035 --> 00:25:13,434
Hey, now…

258
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,072
You boys don't know what you're doing,
I can see that already.

259
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:22,850
Do you know who you're fucking with?
Back the fuck up, back up.

260
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:26,927
D'you know who you're fucking with
in cell number four on the ninth floor.

261
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:29,687
- Billy Ray Valentine?
- Yes.

262
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:31,330
Move it.

263
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:35,270
- You made bail.
- I did?

264
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:50,021
May I suggest using a night stick, officer?

265
00:25:50,246 --> 00:25:52,043
Get outta here.

266
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:20,427
Mr Valentine.

267
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:24,561
Could you spare us a moment?

268
00:26:26,037 --> 00:26:30,189
- Don't I know you two guys?
- Step inside, nice and warm in here.

269
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,654
- Whisky, all you want.
- I ain't falling for the same trick twice.

270
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:39,078
You'd get me in the car,
and have me arrested for stealing it.

271
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:42,301
Why should we do that, Mr Valentine?

272
00:26:42,555 --> 00:26:45,194
We're the ones who bailed you out.

273
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,608
Who are y'all? What y'all want?

274
00:27:22,852 --> 00:27:27,482
We want to help you. My brother and I
run a privately funded programme,

275
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:30,489
to rehabilitate
culturally disadvantaged people.

276
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:34,809
We'd like to supply you
with a home of your own, a car,

277
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:38,745
a generous bank account,
and employment with our company.

278
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:42,188
We're going to start you at $80,000 a year.

279
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:45,992
- $80,000?
- Mmm.

280
00:27:46,212 --> 00:27:47,645
Excuse me.

281
00:27:50,091 --> 00:27:52,605
This is a practical joke, right, brother?

282
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:58,848
Then these dudes
are a couple of faggots, huh?

283
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:01,134
What's my next move, man?

284
00:28:02,939 --> 00:28:04,930
Thank you, you've been helpful.

285
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:12,905
- What about the payroll?
- We've had the charges dropped.

286
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:15,317
You're a free man, Valentine.

287
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:18,529
We can stop right now
and you can walk out on us forever.

288
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:33,595
No, I believe I can hang out
with you fellas for a while.

289
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:36,121
- Excellent.
- I'm Randolph Duke.

290
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:38,343
How you doing Randy, what's happening?

291
00:28:38,563 --> 00:28:41,714
- My younger brother, Mortimer.
- Hey Morty! What it is.

292
00:28:41,984 --> 00:28:44,134
Billy Ray Valentine, Capricorn.

293
00:28:44,362 --> 00:28:47,559
Randy, that's like Randy Jackson
from the Jackson Five, right?

294
00:28:47,824 --> 00:28:50,054
- Yes, I suppose so.
- Yeah.

295
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:06,360
Here we are, William.

296
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:10,714
How you doing?

297
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:13,573
Hey, Randy, Morty. This
is nice, I like this.

298
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:16,406
- William…
- Billy Ray.

299
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:19,958
William, this is Coleman.
He'll look after your day-to-day needs.

300
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:24,229
- Can I relieve you of those?
- You get a glass, I'll give you a sip.

301
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:29,204
- Perhaps, your coat, sir?
- Yes, this is my coat.

302
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:32,489
Coleman is here to take care of you.
He is your servant.

303
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,661
- May I?
- Get out of here.

304
00:29:34,878 --> 00:29:39,030
Valentine very badly wants to take a hot
bath and get into something comfortable.

305
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:41,536
Don't you, Valentine?

306
00:29:45,515 --> 00:29:47,506
Jacuzzi, sir?

307
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:50,365
I knew you was faggots.
You ain't Jacuzzying nobody.

308
00:29:50,604 --> 00:29:52,993
It's a whirlpool bath sir.

309
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:55,223
I think you'll enjoy it.

310
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,490
Bubbles, man!
Say, when I was growing up,

311
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:07,984
we want a Jacuzzi,
we had to fart in the tub. This is bad!

312
00:30:17,677 --> 00:30:20,908
- What's he doing in there?
- He's singing, sir.

313
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:23,172
They're very musical people, aren't they?

314
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,758
- What shall I do with his clothes?
- Send them to the laundry.

315
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:33,456
He'll need them to wear back to the ghetto,
after I've won our bet.

316
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:38,249
- Well, what do you think?
- I like it, Randy, very nice.

317
00:30:38,576 --> 00:30:41,648
I like the way you have
the mirror and stuff.

318
00:30:41,913 --> 00:30:45,701
- I don't think he understands.
- Morty, I do understand.

319
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:49,118
- William, this is your home.
- Right.

320
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,009
- It belongs to you.
- Yeah, I like my home. It's very nice.

321
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:56,771
- I have nice taste in houses.
- Everything here is yours.

322
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,250
- This is my stuff?
- Your own property.

323
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:01,466
- My own personal shit.
- You understand?

324
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:04,677
Yeah, I like that.
You know what I like most?

325
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:07,658
The curtains, it's beautiful the way
I've set this place up.

326
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:10,654
This is something else.
I like it. The cabinets.

327
00:31:10,904 --> 00:31:14,214
Beautiful. I suppose
you'll give me this TV set for free?

328
00:31:14,492 --> 00:31:16,722
- That's right.
- Everything here is mine?

329
00:31:16,953 --> 00:31:19,626
- I guess the stereo's mine too?
- Absolutely.

330
00:31:19,873 --> 00:31:22,467
This is too much.
I could really dig this. You know why?

331
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:24,700
This happens to me every week.

332
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,673
This is your house.

333
00:31:27,924 --> 00:31:31,553
These are your personal possessions.

334
00:31:31,845 --> 00:31:34,439
You will only be stealing from yourself.

335
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:37,479
Look, first you throw my ass in jail.

336
00:31:37,727 --> 00:31:42,164
Then you run me some garbage
about how this is my house, this is my rug

337
00:31:42,482 --> 00:31:44,712
and this is my personal slave too.

338
00:31:44,943 --> 00:31:49,061
I understand how you feel
but the fact remains, all this is yours.

339
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,674
You may do with it whatever you wish.

340
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,619
This is my stuff.
I can do what I want with it, right?

341
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,712
This is my vase, Billy Ray's vase?

342
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:02,952
I can play Harlem Globetrotters
shit with it, like Meadow Lark Lemon?

343
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:10,666
- Hey man, I'm sorry about that.
- Perfectly all right, it was your vase.

344
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:14,958
That was a fake, right?

345
00:32:15,186 --> 00:32:17,700
I think we paid $35,000 for it.

346
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:24,087
But, I seem to remember we estimated
its value at $50,000 for the insurance.

347
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:30,347
You see, Mortimer? William
has already made us a profit of $15,000.

348
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:41,500
You want me to break something else?

349
00:32:41,717 --> 00:32:42,991
No.

350
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,429
Excuse me.

351
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:11,808
I hope we're not pushing it, using Mr
Beeks for this, as well as the crop report.

352
00:33:12,168 --> 00:33:16,161
We are involved in a very important
scientific experiment, Mortimer

353
00:33:16,465 --> 00:33:19,059
and Mr Beeks has always proven reliable.

354
00:33:58,012 --> 00:33:59,843
Excuse me… Sorry.

355
00:34:06,313 --> 00:34:08,543
Hello, Todd. Gents.

356
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:27,387
Gentlemen. There is something rotten
in the Heritage Club.

357
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:31,520
Something that has
never raised its vile head

358
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:35,229
in the 208 years of the club's history.

359
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,687
There is a thief,

360
00:34:38,892 --> 00:34:40,883
and he's sitting here among us.

361
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:44,015
Not an ordinary thief like the man

362
00:34:44,274 --> 00:34:47,505
Winthorpe had the guts
to stand up to yesterday.

363
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:52,374
No, this man is a hundred times lower.

364
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:58,509
I'd like to introduce Mr Beeks
of Lyndhurst Security.

365
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,800
Thank you. I'd like
to ask you gentlemen to all stand up.

366
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:19,071
I'd like to ask you to place
your left hand on the shoulder

367
00:35:19,355 --> 00:35:22,153
of the man to your left.

368
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:29,022
I would now ask you

369
00:35:29,242 --> 00:35:33,952
to place your right hand in the coat pocket
of the member to your right.

370
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:37,599
And empty the contents
of those pockets onto the table.

371
00:35:42,048 --> 00:35:43,879
Thank you.

372
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:46,223
You may sit.

373
00:35:57,107 --> 00:36:00,099
We marked three $50 bills with red X's.

374
00:36:02,363 --> 00:36:04,797
Less than ten minutes ago

375
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:08,912
those bills were stolen
from a coat in the cloakroom.

376
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,163
One of our operatives witnessed the theft.

377
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:47,589
Now, wait a minute. I've never seen
this money before in my life.

378
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:52,033
Randolph, Mortimer, this is outrageous.
I haven't done anything wrong.

379
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:55,480
Oh, Winthorpe.

380
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:58,628
I'm glad your parents
are not alive to see this.

381
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:02,890
Wait, this is preposterous.
This is insane.

382
00:37:03,141 --> 00:37:05,894
I have no reason to steal. I'm not a thief.

383
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:09,181
I demand a fair hearing.
At least grant me that.

384
00:37:29,087 --> 00:37:32,159
You realise you're making
a grave mistake.

385
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:36,178
Boy, are you two going to be sorry.
You know who I am?

386
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:39,986
Yeah, Winthorpe Louis III.

387
00:37:40,267 --> 00:37:43,065
I'm permitted two calls,
point me to the phone.

388
00:37:43,312 --> 00:37:46,463
- Take off your clothes.
- Wait, I know my rights.

389
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:48,085
Take off your clothes.

390
00:37:49,444 --> 00:37:53,119
You are making a career decision here.
Now, you'd better think about it.

391
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:56,365
Because you'll have to live with it
for the rest of your life.

392
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,578
Strip, before I tear you a new asshole.

393
00:38:03,668 --> 00:38:05,659
Did you hear what this man said?

394
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:09,189
Now, I have witnesses.
This man is physically threatening me.

395
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:14,426
Winthorpe…

396
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,312
Louis the third.

397
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:21,074
All right. One gold watch.

398
00:38:25,151 --> 00:38:27,949
One alligator skin wallet.

399
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:32,648
Master Charge,
American Express… Gold Card.

400
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,797
Visa, Diner's Club, Carte Blanche.

401
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:40,032
Two tickets…

402
00:38:40,794 --> 00:38:44,230
- "La Bo-heem"
- "La Bohème" - it's an opera.

403
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:47,124
It's an opera.

404
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:59,001
- One cellophane bag.
- I've never seen that before in my life.

405
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:06,126
That's PCP - phencyclidine.
Angel dust.

406
00:39:06,407 --> 00:39:08,796
You ever seen
what this stuff does to kids?

407
00:39:09,035 --> 00:39:13,187
You're looking
at three to five, mandatory… Louis.

408
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,432
What's happening, Terry?
Gimme a bottle of your best champagne.

409
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:41,527
You've got a nerve,
showing your face here after all this time.

410
00:39:41,822 --> 00:39:44,052
Look, man, I got your money.

411
00:39:44,868 --> 00:39:48,656
I got your poor… measly…$27…

412
00:39:48,956 --> 00:39:50,992
with interest.

413
00:39:52,543 --> 00:39:55,376
Billy Ray, honey. Ls that you?

414
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:59,418
Who do you think it is?
Terence, get the lady some champagne.

415
00:39:59,718 --> 00:40:03,870
In fact, champagne for everybody,
courtesy of Billy Ray Valentine.

416
00:40:12,149 --> 00:40:14,140
A toast to Billy Ray?

417
00:40:18,823 --> 00:40:20,222
I'm very sexy.

418
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:24,321
People will say, "Billy Ray, you're sexy,"
and not understand my sexuality.

419
00:40:24,621 --> 00:40:26,100
I know.

420
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:32,574
You was in the tank last night,
braggin' on your limousine.

421
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,309
You're the motherfucker
I was gonna carve.

422
00:40:36,552 --> 00:40:38,349
Yeah.

423
00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:43,521
Motherfucker?

424
00:40:43,727 --> 00:40:45,445
<i>Moi?</i>

425
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:49,355
That's my limousine outside,
why don't you take a look at it?

426
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,641
Right outside?

427
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:55,118
Yeah.

428
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:57,356
You took care of him, baby.

429
00:40:57,576 --> 00:41:00,932
I was gonna kick his ass,
but I'm a peaceful man.

430
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:12,137
Ladies, it's time for me to get home.

431
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:16,662
But if any of you ladies want
to drop by my house for cocktails,

432
00:41:16,973 --> 00:41:19,487
there's plenty of room in my limousine.

433
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:21,717
Come on, everybody.

434
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,316
- You're looking so fine, Billy Ray.
- Thank you very much.

435
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:57,895
If you're gonna vomit,
the bathroom's downstairs.

436
00:41:58,187 --> 00:42:00,178
No, downstairs, man.

437
00:42:02,025 --> 00:42:03,424
Shit!

438
00:42:06,113 --> 00:42:08,263
Hey! Hey!

439
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,562
That's a Persian rug. It's from Persia.

440
00:42:19,378 --> 00:42:21,608
What is this shit here?

441
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,388
Hold up! Hey, who's been
putting out their Kools on my floor?

442
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,508
Who has been putting out
their Kools on my floor?

443
00:42:36,189 --> 00:42:38,703
Have you people ever heard of coasters?

444
00:42:42,654 --> 00:42:47,205
Would you like me to prepare some
more hors d'oeuvres for the guests, sir?

445
00:42:47,535 --> 00:42:49,526
Fuck them.

446
00:42:49,746 --> 00:42:53,864
Coleman, there was more people
in this room before, where 'd they go?

447
00:42:54,168 --> 00:42:57,683
I believe some of them
have adjourned upstairs, sir.

448
00:42:58,047 --> 00:42:59,844
To my bedroom?

449
00:43:01,843 --> 00:43:04,038
I'm waiting for you, Billy Ray.

450
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:07,125
Put your clothes on and get out.

451
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:27,273
Yeah, that's my girl, over there.

452
00:43:34,797 --> 00:43:37,027
Can I have everybody's attention please?

453
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,095
Get the fuck out!

454
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:00,983
Good night, sir.

455
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:04,559
Good night, madam.
I hope you enjoyed it.

456
00:44:08,795 --> 00:44:10,194
Thank you.

457
00:44:14,343 --> 00:44:17,255
It was a stone groove, my man.

458
00:44:17,513 --> 00:44:19,504
You are the most righteous…

459
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:23,080
Get the fuck out, man.
Let's go, come on.

460
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:26,060
Hurry up.

461
00:44:27,191 --> 00:44:30,979
And be quiet out there.
My neighbours are asleep, they work too.

462
00:44:35,158 --> 00:44:36,989
Well, your…

463
00:44:37,202 --> 00:44:40,672
Your friends seemed to enjoy it,
I thought it was a great success.

464
00:44:40,957 --> 00:44:45,792
They weren't friends. They're a bunch of
freeloaders, treating my house like a zoo.

465
00:44:47,464 --> 00:44:52,174
Why don't you retire, sir? I'll straighten
up. You've got a big day tomorrow.

466
00:44:54,806 --> 00:44:57,843
Yeah, yeah, I think I will…

467
00:44:59,853 --> 00:45:01,650
…retire.

468
00:45:02,606 --> 00:45:05,166
Good night, Coleman. Thanks, man.

469
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,720
Good night, sir.

470
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:35,378
Let's go, Winthorpe.

471
00:45:48,367 --> 00:45:51,996
- Excuse me.
- I'll see you later, we'll have lunch.

472
00:45:52,288 --> 00:45:55,200
How would you like
to make a fast hundred?

473
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:57,449
I just got out.

474
00:45:57,669 --> 00:46:02,060
Are you trying to entrap me right here?
You guys must be getting desperate.

475
00:46:30,624 --> 00:46:32,615
Is that your purse?

476
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,661
Yes.

477
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:38,872
That's a nice purse.

478
00:46:41,303 --> 00:46:43,294
Thank you.

479
00:46:49,187 --> 00:46:51,655
Darling, I'm so glad to see you.

480
00:46:52,524 --> 00:46:55,322
Louis, you're making a scene.

481
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,311
The good news is I'm innocent.

482
00:46:58,531 --> 00:47:01,568
I've never done anything resembling this.

483
00:47:01,826 --> 00:47:04,818
Louis, you look awful. I'm so ashamed.

484
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,753
Those clothes and those shoes and…

485
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:12,513
you've been fighting, and you smell.

486
00:47:13,715 --> 00:47:15,706
I smell?

487
00:47:15,926 --> 00:47:19,475
Penelope, do you realise
where I've been since yesterday?

488
00:47:19,763 --> 00:47:22,357
They beat me up and stole my clothes.

489
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,795
Those men wanted to have sex with me.

490
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:28,648
- Can we discuss this somewhere else?
- They tried to bend me over this…

491
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:33,218
If this place is indicative of correctional
institutions in this country,

492
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:35,963
they might as well let
all the convicts out.

493
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:38,190
It's far worse on the inside.

494
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:43,040
Stealing from your friends, Louis?
Heroin, Louis? Have you lost your mind?

495
00:47:43,374 --> 00:47:46,571
Mother wants me to call off the wedding
and so does Todd.

496
00:47:46,836 --> 00:47:49,350
Todd, what does Todd have to do with it?

497
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:54,185
You've been fired from Duke & Duke.
They're charging you with embezzlement.

498
00:47:55,554 --> 00:47:58,273
Embezzlement?
I've never stolen anything in my life.

499
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:00,586
How could the man I loved,

500
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:04,439
whose children I wanted to have
and breast-feed, be a heroin dealer?

501
00:48:04,731 --> 00:48:06,961
It wasn't heroin, it was angel dust, PCP…

502
00:48:08,194 --> 00:48:11,345
Listen Penelope,
I swear to you, on my honour,

503
00:48:11,614 --> 00:48:13,605
with almighty God as my witness,

504
00:48:13,825 --> 00:48:16,259
I am not an angel dust dealer.

505
00:48:20,917 --> 00:48:22,987
Oh, Louis.

506
00:48:27,925 --> 00:48:29,961
I've been looking
everywhere for you, baby.

507
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:34,216
- Louis, I'm hurting. I just need a shot.
- Would you please…

508
00:48:34,516 --> 00:48:38,509
- Who is this person?
- I've never seen this woman before.

509
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:42,221
Don't say that, Louis.

510
00:48:44,402 --> 00:48:47,872
Come on baby, just a dime bag.
I'll do all those things you like.

511
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:56,306
You lying… filthy… disgusting… creep.

512
00:48:56,624 --> 00:49:01,334
Todd was right about you. I never want
to see you again as long as I live.

513
00:49:13,644 --> 00:49:17,034
Grand! Great! Thanks a lot.

514
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:21,603
It was a joke.
Your friend said it would get you off.

515
00:49:21,903 --> 00:49:26,772
- Someone told you to do this to me?
- Yeah, and he paid me $100.

516
00:49:27,117 --> 00:49:28,516
He's over there.

517
00:49:32,457 --> 00:49:35,654
Let me get this straight,
I give you 20 for the cab,

518
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:38,194
and you'll give me 50 at your house?

519
00:49:38,422 --> 00:49:41,653
That is correct.
My butler will give you $50,

520
00:49:41,926 --> 00:49:43,917
and drive you anywhere you wish.

521
00:49:44,137 --> 00:49:47,447
You don't exactly look like
the type that has a butler.

522
00:49:47,724 --> 00:49:52,115
- If you're hustling me…
- Hustling you, hustling you?

523
00:49:55,442 --> 00:49:58,832
You don't think they give these
to just anyone, do you?

524
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:03,185
I can charge goods and services
in over 86 countries around the world.

525
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:07,527
Yeah? Well I don't take credit cards.

526
00:50:17,467 --> 00:50:20,300
You'll see what a mistake all this was.

527
00:50:30,023 --> 00:50:31,217
Yes?

528
00:50:31,399 --> 00:50:34,948
Coleman, could you let me in?
I'm having trouble with my key.

529
00:50:35,237 --> 00:50:40,436
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Just let me in, I'm in no mood for jokes.

530
00:50:40,785 --> 00:50:45,301
Coleman? There's no Coleman here.
You've made a mistake.

531
00:50:53,007 --> 00:50:54,998
Excuse me, for a moment.

532
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:59,245
Coleman! Let me in.

533
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:04,434
If you don't go away,
I shall call the police.

534
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:22,958
Hello. I'll be making a cash withdrawal
for the amount of $500.

535
00:51:24,544 --> 00:51:26,614
In fact, make it $1,000.

536
00:51:33,888 --> 00:51:35,526
Excuse me.

537
00:51:44,191 --> 00:51:48,548
I'm sorry, Mr Winthorpe,
but the IRS has frozen your accounts.

538
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,774
What? You know me.

539
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:53,140
You're a heroin dealer, Mr Winthorpe.

540
00:51:53,368 --> 00:51:56,883
It wasn't heroin, it was angel dust - PCP
and I never touched it.

541
00:51:57,164 --> 00:52:01,521
Regardless, it's not the kind of business
we want at First National.

542
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:05,370
May I see your credit cards please?

543
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,069
- I've been ordered to repossess them.
- What?

544
00:52:13,308 --> 00:52:17,779
Wait, what am I supposed to live on?
What's going to happen to me?

545
00:52:19,148 --> 00:52:20,547
Roger.

546
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:36,656
Why is someone
deliberately trying to ruin my life?

547
00:52:36,918 --> 00:52:39,591
Tell you what. Forget about the $50, OK?

548
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:41,829
I'm just real tired. I'm going home.

549
00:52:43,801 --> 00:52:47,111
You've got to believe me.
You must believe me.

550
00:52:47,388 --> 00:52:50,585
I have been framed.
You can't just leave me here.

551
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:53,240
I've got enough problems, Louis.

552
00:52:57,316 --> 00:52:59,307
Come on, come on.

553
00:53:00,737 --> 00:53:02,534
Listen! Wait!

554
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:03,808
Wait.

555
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:09,789
I have over $150,000 in that bank.

556
00:53:10,915 --> 00:53:14,703
But you don't care because
you helped them do this to me.

557
00:53:22,178 --> 00:53:24,294
Get off your knees, Louis.

558
00:53:32,648 --> 00:53:34,639
Give me your hand.

559
00:53:37,696 --> 00:53:39,493
Soft hands.

560
00:53:40,658 --> 00:53:44,856
And a manicure. Never done a hard day's
work in your life, have you?

561
00:53:49,918 --> 00:53:52,512
I'm gonna regret this but…

562
00:53:52,755 --> 00:53:55,064
come on. Get in.

563
00:54:13,445 --> 00:54:17,438
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
This has been a grave mistake.

564
00:54:18,075 --> 00:54:21,067
Hey, that looks just like
the dude that had me busted.

565
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:23,240
Sir?

566
00:54:23,457 --> 00:54:26,369
Right there,
he looked just like the mother…

567
00:54:26,627 --> 00:54:29,903
I mean, he looks just like
the gentleman that had me busted.

568
00:54:30,673 --> 00:54:32,425
To whom are you referring, sir?

569
00:54:32,634 --> 00:54:34,431
The dude right there.

570
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:38,898
- Right over there.
- That's my car.

571
00:54:39,141 --> 00:54:43,180
Coleman!
Coleman, that's my car!

572
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,870
That's my car! That's my driver.

573
00:54:52,698 --> 00:54:54,893
There's some strange shit
going on here, Coleman.

574
00:54:55,952 --> 00:54:58,420
You don't want
to be late for your first day, sir.

575
00:55:06,214 --> 00:55:08,569
What do they want me to do here?

576
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,349
- I'm sure they'll tell you.
- What if I can't do it?

577
00:55:13,389 --> 00:55:15,380
Just be yourself, sir.

578
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,070
Whatever happens,
they can't take that away from you.

579
00:55:35,164 --> 00:55:37,758
- Excuse me, my name is…
- Mr Valentine.

580
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,468
They're waiting in the last office
down the hall.

581
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:07,777
- Ah, William, my boy. Right on time.
- Come in, come in.

582
00:56:10,496 --> 00:56:12,487
Sit down.

583
00:56:15,418 --> 00:56:18,216
No thanks, guys.
I already had breakfast.

584
00:56:18,463 --> 00:56:21,023
This is not a meal, Valentine.

585
00:56:21,258 --> 00:56:25,490
We are here to try to explain to you,
what it is we do here.

586
00:56:25,805 --> 00:56:28,603
We are commodities brokers, William.

587
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:31,080
Now, what are commodities?

588
00:56:31,311 --> 00:56:34,109
Commodities are agricultural products.

589
00:56:34,356 --> 00:56:37,985
Like coffee, that you had for breakfast.

590
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:40,917
Wheat, which is used to make bread.

591
00:56:41,156 --> 00:56:43,351
Pork bellies, which is used to make bacon,

592
00:56:43,575 --> 00:56:47,454
which you might find in a bacon,
lettuce and tomato sandwich.

593
00:56:49,165 --> 00:56:54,797
Then there are other commodities like…
frozen orange juice… and gold.

594
00:56:55,172 --> 00:56:59,643
Though, of course, gold
doesn't grow on trees like oranges.

595
00:57:01,221 --> 00:57:03,815
- Clear so far?
- Yeah.

596
00:57:04,057 --> 00:57:07,891
Good, William.
Now, some of our clients are speculating

597
00:57:08,187 --> 00:57:11,418
that the price of gold
will rise in the future.

598
00:57:11,691 --> 00:57:16,685
We have other clients who are speculating
that the price of gold is going to fall.

599
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:19,703
They've placed their orders with us

600
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:23,625
and we buy or sell their gold for them.

601
00:57:23,913 --> 00:57:26,586
Tell him the good part.

602
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:32,032
The good part is that no matter whether
our clients make money,

603
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:37,296
or lose money,
Duke & Duke get the commissions.

604
00:57:37,971 --> 00:57:40,485
Well, what do you think, Valentine?

605
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:46,196
Sounds to me like you guys
are a couple of bookies.

606
00:57:46,481 --> 00:57:48,039
I told you he'd understand.

607
00:57:49,776 --> 00:57:53,451
It doesn't take a genius
to figure out what happened.

608
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:57,971
It's the same guy who tried
to rob the payroll, no doubt, that's him.

609
00:57:58,286 --> 00:58:00,277
He planted the drugs on me.

610
00:58:00,497 --> 00:58:02,692
Rachim, Mohammed, Larry.
How are you guys doing?

611
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:05,714
Hey, hey, how ya doing?

612
00:58:07,546 --> 00:58:09,537
You know those people?

613
00:58:21,855 --> 00:58:24,050
He was wearing my Harvard tie.

614
00:58:24,274 --> 00:58:28,552
Can you believe it? My Harvard tie.
Like, oh sure, he went to Harvard.

615
00:58:30,197 --> 00:58:35,430
If he's being driven around in my car,
he could actually be living in my house.

616
00:58:36,621 --> 00:58:38,816
Maybe he's even taken my job.

617
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:43,239
For all I know, right at this moment
he could be fondling my fiancée.

618
00:58:44,005 --> 00:58:47,714
And Coleman -
after years of service, this betrayal.

619
00:58:48,009 --> 00:58:50,000
I don't understand it.

620
00:58:50,721 --> 00:58:53,713
There's going to be retribution.
Oh, he's going to pay.

621
00:58:53,975 --> 00:58:56,489
- The things that I…
- Shut up, Louis.

622
00:58:56,728 --> 00:59:00,118
Taxis cost money,
food costs money and rent costs money!

623
00:59:00,399 --> 00:59:04,233
Now, you want me to help you out,
I expect a lot in return.

624
00:59:04,528 --> 00:59:08,521
These were here when I moved in.
Put 'em on if you want.

625
00:59:14,832 --> 00:59:19,860
Look, I cannot begin to tell you
how much I appreciate this…

626
00:59:20,213 --> 00:59:24,365
- Ophelia.
- Ophelia, you realise that's the name…

627
00:59:24,676 --> 00:59:27,793
I know, Hamlet's girlfriend.
He went crazy, she killed herself.

628
00:59:28,055 --> 00:59:30,853
This is not Shakespeare, Louis.

629
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:35,651
I'm 24. I'm from a small, miserable
mining town you probably never heard of.

630
00:59:37,232 --> 00:59:41,544
The only thing I've got going for me,
is this body, this face,

631
00:59:41,863 --> 00:59:43,854
and what I got up here.

632
00:59:53,626 --> 00:59:55,617
I don't do drugs.

633
00:59:55,837 --> 00:59:57,828
And I don't have a pimp.

634
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,541
This place is a dump.

635
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:04,992
But it's cheap,
it's clean and it's all mine.

636
01:00:05,265 --> 01:00:08,655
I've saved 42 grand
and it's in T-Bills earning interest.

637
01:00:08,935 --> 01:00:12,166
I've got three more years on my back.
I'll have enough to retire.

638
01:00:13,691 --> 01:00:15,886
You're a prostitute?

639
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:24,586
I'm talking about
a business proposition, Louis.

640
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:29,778
I help you get back on your feet
and you pay me, in cash, five figures.

641
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:33,118
That's the deal
and it's not subject to negotiation.

642
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,371
Understood?

643
01:00:51,609 --> 01:00:56,239
By the way, food and rent are not
the only things here that cost money.

644
01:00:56,573 --> 01:00:58,484
You sleep on the couch.

645
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,190
It's hit rock bottom. Come on, let's buy.

646
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:07,111
Buy 200 May belly contracts at 66.8.

647
01:01:07,336 --> 01:01:11,534
- Put them on my personal account.
- That's a big mistake, man.

648
01:01:11,841 --> 01:01:17,757
- Valentine, this is very important, watch.
- You're going to get reamed on this one.

649
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,973
Why shouldn't we buy now, William?

650
01:01:21,227 --> 01:01:22,979
Price is going to keep going down.

651
01:01:25,189 --> 01:01:27,623
Randolph, this isn't
Monopoly money we're playing with.

652
01:01:30,279 --> 01:01:33,351
This is Randolph Duke.
Hold that belly over a moment.

653
01:01:34,742 --> 01:01:39,338
Tell me why you think
the price of pork bellies is going down.

654
01:01:39,664 --> 01:01:44,374
- It's Christmas time. Everybody's uptight.
- Could we please buy now?

655
01:01:44,712 --> 01:01:48,068
- If you want to lose money go ahead.
- What are you trying to say?

656
01:01:48,341 --> 01:01:51,856
OK, pork belly prices
have been dropping all morning.

657
01:01:52,137 --> 01:01:56,688
So everybody's waiting for them
to hit rock bottom so they can buy cheap.

658
01:01:57,018 --> 01:01:59,816
The people with
pork belly contracts are thinking,

659
01:02:00,063 --> 01:02:03,214
"Hey, we're losing all our money
and Christmas is coming."

660
01:02:03,483 --> 01:02:06,475
"I won't be able to buy my
son the GI Joe with the Kung Fu grip."

661
01:02:06,737 --> 01:02:10,730
"And my wife won't make love to me
cos I ain't got no money."

662
01:02:11,034 --> 01:02:13,502
They're panicking, screaming, "Sell, sell."

663
01:02:13,745 --> 01:02:18,023
They don't want to lose all their money.
They are panicking right now. I can feel it.

664
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:19,972
Look at them.

665
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:22,967
He's right, Mortimer, my God, look at it.

666
01:02:23,923 --> 01:02:26,312
I'd wait till you get to 64, then buy.

667
01:02:26,551 --> 01:02:28,940
You'll have cleared out
all the suckers by then.

668
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:32,733
Do you realise how much money
he just saved us?

669
01:02:32,975 --> 01:02:35,364
Money isn't everything, Randolph.

670
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:42,468
Advise our clients
interested in bellies to buy at 64.

671
01:02:42,778 --> 01:02:45,008
Mr Valentine has set the price.

672
01:02:47,492 --> 01:02:51,371
Well done, William.
Very well done.

673
01:02:51,663 --> 01:02:54,416
Come on, Randolph, we're gonna be late.

674
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:28,254
Yo…
Mortimer dropped his money clip.

675
01:03:29,457 --> 01:03:32,449
- You can count it, it's all there.
- Thank you.

676
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:37,420
- It's all there, count it.
- I'm sure it is. Keep up the good work.

677
01:03:37,758 --> 01:03:39,794
All right, Randy.

678
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:42,001
Nice try, Mortimer.

679
01:04:36,075 --> 01:04:38,669
That was great, that was really great.

680
01:04:42,373 --> 01:04:45,171
…and she stepped on the ball.

681
01:04:47,921 --> 01:04:51,277
Oh my God, I don't believe it.

682
01:04:54,429 --> 01:04:58,468
- Ah, there you are.
- I think I'm going to be sick.

683
01:04:58,767 --> 01:05:00,758
Don't worry, I'll handle this, Pookums.

684
01:05:02,563 --> 01:05:04,554
Todd, Harry, Andrew, Philip.

685
01:05:04,774 --> 01:05:08,608
I realise this looks completely awful
but I just wanted to assure you,

686
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:11,543
my friends, that I am completely innocent.

687
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:15,980
I'm going to fight this.
Someone is out to get me and I know who.

688
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,757
The important thing is
that I can rely on you,

689
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:22,317
my friends, as character witnesses.

690
01:05:29,636 --> 01:05:31,672
I'm going to be defending myself

691
01:05:31,888 --> 01:05:35,244
and I wondered
if you could see your way clear

692
01:05:35,518 --> 01:05:40,114
to perhaps advance me
a small loan until the hearing.

693
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:46,428
Frankly, Winthorpe,
and I think I speak for all of us,

694
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:51,017
I think it shows incredibly bad taste
for you to embarrass us like this.

695
01:05:53,163 --> 01:05:55,313
I believe I'm still a member of this club.

696
01:05:57,376 --> 01:06:02,769
Nobody wants to buy your drugs, Louis.
Why don't you just go away?

697
01:06:16,314 --> 01:06:18,305
Burnt my fingers, man.

698
01:06:21,445 --> 01:06:23,436
I beg your pardon.

699
01:06:25,033 --> 01:06:27,831
Man, that watch is so hot, it's smokin'.

700
01:06:28,078 --> 01:06:31,753
Hot? Do you mean to imply, stolen?

701
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:35,431
- I'll give you 50 bucks for it.
- 50 bucks!

702
01:06:36,129 --> 01:06:40,247
No, no, no. This is a Rochefoucauld,
the thinnest water-resistant watch in the world.

703
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:43,110
Singularly unique, sculptured in design,

704
01:06:43,345 --> 01:06:47,941
hand-crafted in Switzerland
and water-resistant to three atmospheres.

705
01:06:48,268 --> 01:06:53,706
This is the sports watch of the '80s.
$6,955 retail.

706
01:06:54,066 --> 01:06:55,704
Got a receipt?

707
01:06:55,901 --> 01:06:58,096
Look, it tells time simultaneously

708
01:06:58,321 --> 01:07:01,518
in Monte Carlo, Beverly Hills, London,
Paris, Rome and Gstaad.

709
01:07:01,783 --> 01:07:05,901
In Philadelphia it's worth 50 bucks.

710
01:07:06,997 --> 01:07:08,988
Just give me the money.

711
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,700
How much for the gun?

712
01:07:29,398 --> 01:07:32,993
So, this snail is standing
in front of the Cadillac salesman, see,

713
01:07:33,277 --> 01:07:36,667
and says,
"How much is that Cadillac?"

714
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:47,960
The snail says,
"I want a big 'S' put on each door"

715
01:07:48,253 --> 01:07:53,373
"and on top of the car, I want a big 'S'
so everybody can see it."

716
01:07:53,717 --> 01:07:57,869
Salesman says, "Why do you want that?"
He says, "When I drive down the avenue…

717
01:07:58,181 --> 01:08:02,652
"I want everybody to say
'Look at that S-car-go."'

718
01:08:09,569 --> 01:08:12,129
"Look at the S-car-go."

719
01:08:19,288 --> 01:08:23,440
I'm considering going long on April wheat.
What do you think, Valentine?

720
01:08:26,922 --> 01:08:30,517
I can think of three good reasons
why you shouldn't do that, judge.

721
01:08:30,802 --> 01:08:35,000
One, the Russian wheat harvest isn't going
to be as bad as people think… and two…

722
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:41,302
…and three, judging by
the jewels around your girlfriend's neck,

723
01:08:41,564 --> 01:08:45,079
I think you're going to need every penny
just to keep her happy.

724
01:09:25,364 --> 01:09:28,879
103.
That's it, you're staying in bed.

725
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:34,154
That man has moved into my house.
He's stolen my job. I have to do something.

726
01:09:36,502 --> 01:09:38,493
Stay here.

727
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:47,200
It's ten o'clock - here's Johnny.

728
01:09:47,431 --> 01:09:51,390
Listen, baby, I'm sorry.
My momma just came in from outta town.

729
01:09:51,686 --> 01:09:53,677
Can we do it next week?

730
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,559
Flowers for me?

731
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:01,370
Thanks.

732
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:08,792
- What are you doing?
- You've got company.

733
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:11,428
Business is business.
I'll go for a walk.

734
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:14,659
- Fresh air will do me good.
- Lay down.

735
01:10:19,301 --> 01:10:22,293
I'm sorry you had to cancel
your appointment.

736
01:10:25,183 --> 01:10:27,174
What are you doing?

737
01:10:41,159 --> 01:10:44,390
Ophelia, I can't tell you
how good that feels.

738
01:10:45,414 --> 01:10:48,008
You've been so kind to me.

739
01:10:48,251 --> 01:10:51,561
I'm just protecting my investment.
That's all.

740
01:10:53,757 --> 01:10:55,748
Shut up and go to sleep.

741
01:11:11,027 --> 01:11:14,417
99 and a half. You're not
getting out of bed until it's normal.

742
01:11:14,698 --> 01:11:17,292
I feel fine and I've
inconvenienced you enough.

743
01:11:17,534 --> 01:11:20,094
You have work to do and so do I.

744
01:11:20,329 --> 01:11:22,320
Nobody works on Christmas Eve.

745
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:26,453
I'm going shopping
and then I'll make you a nice quiet dinner.

746
01:11:26,753 --> 01:11:28,744
Now, read your paper.

747
01:11:44,482 --> 01:11:48,555
Christmas! I'll give him a Christmas
present he'll never forget.

748
01:13:16,003 --> 01:13:18,801
Ah William, where've you been?
The party's already begun.

749
01:13:19,048 --> 01:13:21,039
I have some work to finish.

750
01:13:21,259 --> 01:13:24,251
It's Christmas Eve
and William wants to keep working.

751
01:13:25,639 --> 01:13:28,915
I'll think of you in Stockholm,
when I accept the Nobel Prize.

752
01:13:29,185 --> 01:13:33,497
The wager has two parts - something
about a second party turning to crime.

753
01:13:37,403 --> 01:13:39,837
Didn't you say you had work to do?

754
01:13:40,072 --> 01:13:44,384
Yes sir. I was wondering about this
$10,000 cheque to Mr Clarence Beeks.

755
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,694
I'll take care of it, Valentine.

756
01:13:46,913 --> 01:13:49,711
I don't recall a Clarence Beeks, Mr Duke.

757
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:52,348
It was before you joined us, Valentine.

758
01:13:52,587 --> 01:13:57,058
We did manage to stay in business
for 47 years before your arrival.

759
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:00,557
Have a drink, William.
Merry Christmas.

760
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:03,796
- Merry Christmas, Mr Duke.
- What?

761
01:14:04,058 --> 01:14:06,970
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, oh, Merry Christmas.

762
01:14:17,615 --> 01:14:21,085
Ho, ho, ho!

763
01:14:32,132 --> 01:14:34,123
Just what do you think you're doing?

764
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,958
Randolph, Mortimer, come in here quickly,
I've finally caught him.

765
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:44,908
- Who are you?
- I've caught him red-handed.

766
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,138
Winthorpe, is that you?

767
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:50,953
I'm making a citizen's arrest.
This man is a drug dealer.

768
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:54,195
Look, his office drawer,
he's got all the bad drugs here.

769
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:57,247
Marijuana joints, pills, Quaaludes,

770
01:14:57,494 --> 01:15:01,772
Valium, yellow ones, red ones,
cocaine grinder, drug needles.

771
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:04,153
He's the pusher, not me.

772
01:15:04,377 --> 01:15:07,335
I just came in
and caught him planting this stuff.

773
01:15:07,589 --> 01:15:10,387
It's obviously
some primitive attempt to frame me.

774
01:15:10,634 --> 01:15:15,025
Frame you? Boy, if that
isn't the pot calling the kettle black.

775
01:15:15,348 --> 01:15:18,101
This man's obviously a lunatic.
I'm calling security.

776
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:21,385
Put that phone down.

777
01:15:23,149 --> 01:15:26,346
Hello, security…
Merry Christmas.

778
01:15:28,863 --> 01:15:31,172
You tried to rob me,
plant drugs on me.

779
01:15:31,408 --> 01:15:35,321
You steal my house, my car, my job.
I ought to kill him now.

780
01:15:35,621 --> 01:15:37,612
Look, this is a big misunderstanding.

781
01:15:37,832 --> 01:15:41,507
I don't know nothing about it.
Could you put the gun away?

782
01:15:41,795 --> 01:15:45,424
Put that gun away at once, Winthorpe.
Have you lost your mind?

783
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:48,275
Freeze, slime ball.

784
01:15:50,472 --> 01:15:55,626
I realise this whole experience
must have been rather unsettling for you.

785
01:15:55,978 --> 01:15:58,014
Winthorpe, don't leave. We can explain.

786
01:15:58,773 --> 01:16:01,367
Yeah, you'll be sorry.

787
01:16:03,945 --> 01:16:07,221
You'll all be very, very sorry.

788
01:16:29,725 --> 01:16:33,638
Poor, deluded creature.
We caught him pilfering at our club,

789
01:16:33,938 --> 01:16:37,248
embezzling funds, selling drugs.

790
01:16:37,525 --> 01:16:39,834
Now he's dressing up like Santa Claus.

791
01:16:40,863 --> 01:16:42,854
Very sordid business.

792
01:16:43,073 --> 01:16:46,622
I can't believe Winthorpe
would fall to pieces like that.

793
01:16:47,036 --> 01:16:49,231
It's not my business,
but he belongs behind bars.

794
01:16:49,456 --> 01:16:52,766
- He's unemployed, Valentine.
- It's no excuse, Mortimer.

795
01:16:53,043 --> 01:16:55,511
He's flat broke, obviously hungry.

796
01:16:55,755 --> 01:16:57,905
But he has money to buy drugs, right?

797
01:16:58,132 --> 01:17:02,045
You can't be soft on people like that.
Take it from me, Randolph.

798
01:18:07,837 --> 01:18:10,067
Pay up, Mortimer, I've won the bet.

799
01:18:12,593 --> 01:18:15,153
Here, one dollar.

800
01:18:17,515 --> 01:18:22,464
We took a perfectly useless
psychopath, like Valentine,

801
01:18:22,813 --> 01:18:26,488
and turned him
into a successful executive.

802
01:18:27,777 --> 01:18:29,768
And during the same time,

803
01:18:29,987 --> 01:18:33,946
we turned an honest, hard-working man

804
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:38,360
into a violently deranged, would-be killer.

805
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:44,023
Now, what are we going to do
about taking Winthorpe back

806
01:18:44,296 --> 01:18:46,287
and returning Valentine to the ghetto?

807
01:18:46,506 --> 01:18:49,657
I don't want Winthorpe back
after what he's done.

808
01:18:50,886 --> 01:18:54,561
You mean keep Valentine on,
as Managing Director?

809
01:18:55,892 --> 01:19:00,647
Do you really believe I would have a nigger
run our family business, Randolph?

810
01:19:00,981 --> 01:19:04,053
Of course not. Neither would I.

811
01:19:04,861 --> 01:19:07,853
I do think we should hold off
on switching them back, though.

812
01:19:08,114 --> 01:19:11,106
Until we get that crop report,
New Year's Eve, don't you?

813
01:19:11,368 --> 01:19:13,928
Absolutely, no sense
rocking the boat until then.

814
01:19:14,163 --> 01:19:17,712
If Mr Beeks does what we paid him to do,

815
01:19:18,001 --> 01:19:21,152
we should have a very happy New Year.

816
01:19:21,421 --> 01:19:23,412
Indeed.

817
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,709
Hey, Winthorpe, Winthorpe.

818
01:19:52,665 --> 01:19:53,700
Hey.

819
01:20:16,151 --> 01:20:18,949
Hey, Winthorpe.
Yo, Winthorpe.

820
01:20:20,197 --> 01:20:22,506
Winthorpe. Yo.

821
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:28,070
Sorry about that.

822
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:44,171
Yo! Yo!

823
01:20:45,601 --> 01:20:47,592
Hey, Taxi!

824
01:22:45,071 --> 01:22:47,187
Hi, Louis. Merry Christmas.

825
01:22:51,787 --> 01:22:54,096
Louis, I have a big surprise for you.

826
01:22:55,625 --> 01:23:00,335
Excuse me. The door was open…
I'm looking for a Louis Winthorpe.

827
01:23:00,672 --> 01:23:04,347
- Does he live here?
- Wait here a minute, I'll be right back.

828
01:23:09,015 --> 01:23:11,893
Louis, Louis. It's him. It's Valentine.

829
01:23:13,228 --> 01:23:16,220
Louis… Louis?

830
01:23:21,655 --> 01:23:23,134
Louis.

831
01:23:24,867 --> 01:23:27,176
It was close but he's going
to be all right.

832
01:23:27,411 --> 01:23:30,084
Now, make sure he gets plenty of rest.

833
01:23:30,331 --> 01:23:32,447
And for God's sake, no excitement.

834
01:23:34,211 --> 01:23:36,202
Thanks, Doc. Merry Christmas.

835
01:23:36,422 --> 01:23:39,414
Merry Christmas to you.
I'll let myself out, Coleman. Thank you.

836
01:23:39,675 --> 01:23:41,666
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

837
01:23:49,603 --> 01:23:53,312
It was a dream.
I dreamt the whole thing.

838
01:23:53,608 --> 01:23:55,599
It was just a bad dream.

839
01:23:55,819 --> 01:23:57,775
Good morning, sir.

840
01:23:57,988 --> 01:23:59,501
Merry Christmas.

841
01:23:59,698 --> 01:24:03,327
Coleman, I've had
the most absurd nightmare.

842
01:24:03,619 --> 01:24:06,053
I was poor and no one liked me.

843
01:24:06,289 --> 01:24:10,043
I lost my job, I lost my house.
Penelope hated me.

844
01:24:11,003 --> 01:24:13,836
And it was all because
of this terrible, awful Negro.

845
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:21,553
- Oh dear!
- Lt… was… the… Dukes.

846
01:24:21,849 --> 01:24:24,238
You're a dead man, Valentine.

847
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:29,690
It was an experiment.
They used us as guinea pigs, man.

848
01:24:32,778 --> 01:24:34,973
The Dukes used us as guinea pigs.

849
01:24:35,197 --> 01:24:38,348
To see how our lives would turn out.
They made a bet.

850
01:24:38,618 --> 01:24:41,416
- I'm afraid it's true, sir.
- I believe him, Louis.

851
01:24:41,663 --> 01:24:46,453
The Dukes ruined my life over a bet?

852
01:24:46,794 --> 01:24:51,106
- For how much?
- A dollar.

853
01:24:52,634 --> 01:24:54,625
One dollar.

854
01:24:55,721 --> 01:24:58,713
Fine, that's the way they want it.

855
01:25:00,268 --> 01:25:01,542
No problem.

856
01:25:04,147 --> 01:25:07,617
You can't just shoot people
with a double-barrelled shotgun

857
01:25:07,901 --> 01:25:09,892
cos you're pissed at them.

858
01:25:10,112 --> 01:25:13,024
- Why not?
- It's assault with a deadly weapon.

859
01:25:13,282 --> 01:25:15,512
You get 20 years for that shit.

860
01:25:15,744 --> 01:25:17,735
Do you have any better ideas?

861
01:25:17,954 --> 01:25:22,744
Yeah, it seems the best way to hurt rich
people is by turning 'em into poor people.

862
01:25:24,462 --> 01:25:27,898
You have to admit,
you didn't like it yourself a bit.

863
01:25:28,175 --> 01:25:31,167
Under heavy security,

864
01:25:31,428 --> 01:25:35,023
the crop estimates
for next year's orange crop

865
01:25:35,308 --> 01:25:39,096
are being delivered to the Department
Of Agriculture in Washington DC.

866
01:25:39,396 --> 01:25:43,355
Louis, Louis, that's him,
the guy who paid me to talk dirty to you.

867
01:25:43,651 --> 01:25:47,166
In charge of security, Mr Clarence Beeks
of Lyndhurst Security.

868
01:25:47,488 --> 01:25:49,444
Clarence Beeks.

869
01:25:49,657 --> 01:25:54,173
- The Dukes gave him 10 grand.
- I saw 50,000 in the payroll.

870
01:25:54,496 --> 01:25:56,646
Mortimer said it was for research.

871
01:25:56,874 --> 01:26:01,664
Research, so he can get that top secret
report, two days before it goes public.

872
01:26:02,005 --> 01:26:06,920
Oh my God, the Dukes will corner
the entire frozen orange juice market.

873
01:26:07,261 --> 01:26:09,377
Unless somebody stops them.

874
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:12,191
Or beats them to it.

875
01:26:12,434 --> 01:26:14,026
Eggnog?

876
01:26:14,227 --> 01:26:16,787
Duke & Duke, may I ask who's calling?

877
01:26:17,022 --> 01:26:20,014
Duke & Duke, he's busy.
Can you hold please?

878
01:26:20,276 --> 01:26:23,791
May I help you? One moment,
Mr Beeks, I'll put you right through.

879
01:26:31,956 --> 01:26:36,507
Operation "strange fruit"
proceeding according to plan.

880
01:26:37,796 --> 01:26:42,153
I anticipate penetration and acquisition
at 21:00 tomorrow. Hold on.

881
01:26:42,802 --> 01:26:44,793
Fuck off!

882
01:26:45,012 --> 01:26:49,767
- When can we expect delivery?
- I will be leaving DC by train.

883
01:26:50,102 --> 01:26:55,540
Will rendezvous at 24:00 at the
Hilton Hotel, parking level D, Section 4.

884
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:58,539
That's the orange section.

885
01:26:58,778 --> 01:27:00,973
Orange, I like that, very good.

886
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:04,031
The final payment is due on delivery,
in cash.

887
01:27:17,675 --> 01:27:19,427
Jesus, hey!

888
01:27:19,969 --> 01:27:21,960
Happy New Year!

889
01:27:55,176 --> 01:28:00,204
- Ever make it with an ape?
- Harvey, haven't you had enough drink?

890
01:28:00,557 --> 01:28:03,025
Are you kidding,
it's not even New Year's Eve.

891
01:28:03,269 --> 01:28:05,578
Come here, kiss this beautiful ape.

892
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:08,088
Come on.

893
01:28:09,276 --> 01:28:11,267
Harrisburg Express…

894
01:28:19,204 --> 01:28:21,877
- What?
- It's my turn to drive.

895
01:28:24,001 --> 01:28:26,231
- No it isn't.
- Lt is.

896
01:28:26,462 --> 01:28:30,091
- I'm sure you think it is, but it isn't.
- Don't you remember?

897
01:28:30,383 --> 01:28:32,897
You drove the shipment of anchovies.

898
01:28:33,136 --> 01:28:37,448
Yeah, but you had the video tape
recorders this afternoon.

899
01:28:39,727 --> 01:28:41,718
I backed them up about five feet.

900
01:28:41,938 --> 01:28:45,931
We take turns. Sometimes it's longer,
sometimes shorter. It's my turn now.

901
01:28:46,235 --> 01:28:48,669
- No it isn't.
- Yes it is.

902
01:28:56,079 --> 01:28:59,594
- Merry New Year.
- Happy New Year.

903
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:01,911
In this country, we say, "Happy New Year".

904
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:07,323
Thank you for correcting my English,
which stinks.

905
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:11,942
I am Naga Eboko,
exchange student from Cameroon.

906
01:29:41,423 --> 01:29:43,414
Beef jerky time.

907
01:29:44,092 --> 01:29:47,289
- You want some beef jerky?
- No, please.

908
01:29:48,097 --> 01:29:49,735
There's plenty, you know.

909
01:29:50,391 --> 01:29:52,666
This animal's being
routed through to New York.

910
01:29:52,894 --> 01:29:55,931
Its care and feeding instructions
are on this bill of lading.

911
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:58,181
OK, gotcha.

912
01:29:58,401 --> 01:30:02,076
I doubt you'll have need it but, there's
a tranquilliser gun in the First Aid kit.

913
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:07,888
- Oh, yeah?
- Say, have you guys been drinking?

914
01:30:08,203 --> 01:30:11,673
- No, sir. Not us.
- There's enough drunks here already.

915
01:30:16,379 --> 01:30:18,449
Happy New Year.

916
01:30:18,674 --> 01:30:22,587
That's kind of you, son.
A Happy New Year to you, too.

917
01:30:22,887 --> 01:30:27,642
Could I offer either of you two gentlemen
a wee jolt of Irish whisky,

918
01:30:27,976 --> 01:30:30,171
to usher in the New Year.

919
01:30:30,395 --> 01:30:32,386
Not for me, pal.

920
01:30:34,025 --> 01:30:37,017
I do not drink. Lt is against my religion.

921
01:30:37,278 --> 01:30:41,590
I always say, religion's a fine thing,
taken in moderation.

922
01:30:41,909 --> 01:30:43,900
Beef jerky?

923
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:46,953
No son, it gives me wind,
something terrible.

924
01:30:51,294 --> 01:30:53,285
We are moving! We are moving!

925
01:30:57,677 --> 01:31:00,669
New York, here we come!

926
01:31:13,361 --> 01:31:15,591
Come in, my child, join the party.

927
01:31:15,822 --> 01:31:19,781
Let me see, you would be from Austria.
Am I right?

928
01:31:20,077 --> 01:31:23,990
- No, I am Inga from Sweden.
- Sweden?

929
01:31:24,290 --> 01:31:27,327
<i>But you're wearing Lederhosen.</i>

930
01:31:28,504 --> 01:31:30,620
<i>Ja, for sure, from Sweden.</i>

931
01:31:35,470 --> 01:31:37,586
Please, help me with my rucksack.

932
01:31:39,516 --> 01:31:41,507
Oh yeah, sure, why not?

933
01:32:09,926 --> 01:32:13,396
I'm hungry, man.
I've got to get something more to eat.

934
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:17,355
Well, maybe there's
some pretzels in the bar car.

935
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:36,707
You're welcome!

936
01:32:48,595 --> 01:32:51,587
- Who is that?
- Open the door, man.

937
01:32:58,982 --> 01:33:02,372
I'm dressed as a baggage handler.

938
01:33:02,653 --> 01:33:07,329
Imagine how embarrassed I was that
someone had the same costume I had!

939
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:12,562
Monkey, monkey?
I'm a fucking gorilla you clown!

940
01:33:13,249 --> 01:33:17,322
I certainly hope there's
enough space on the train for me.

941
01:33:18,421 --> 01:33:21,652
Naga, Naga Eboko, from Cameroon.

942
01:33:21,925 --> 01:33:24,439
Do you remember me? It's Lionel Joseph.

943
01:33:25,805 --> 01:33:30,276
Lionel, from the African Education
Conference, right?

944
01:33:30,602 --> 01:33:35,153
I was Director of Cultural Events
at the Haile Selassie Pavilion.

945
01:33:35,482 --> 01:33:38,042
I remember
we have big fun there.

946
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,832
<i>Now we are all here,
we will have a picnic, ja?</i>

947
01:33:57,090 --> 01:34:01,049
You will help me get my rucksack down
for the Swedish meatballs.

948
01:34:05,475 --> 01:34:07,864
- Remember the one we did?
- Yeah.

949
01:34:13,484 --> 01:34:16,715
- The memories.
- All day long I could tell those stories.

950
01:34:16,988 --> 01:34:19,980
- Those were good ones.
- The good old days.

951
01:34:20,242 --> 01:34:22,437
<i>- There you are, sweet pea.
- Danke.</i>

952
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:29,077
So, the train will be
pulling into Philadelphia soon.

953
01:34:29,336 --> 01:34:32,248
Will you be getting off
at the city of brotherly love?

954
01:34:32,506 --> 01:34:34,701
I will but you won't…

955
01:34:36,093 --> 01:34:38,084
…Winthorpe.

956
01:34:38,304 --> 01:34:40,499
- See if this one's empty.
- Hey, back off.

957
01:34:40,724 --> 01:34:43,682
I'll rip out your eyes
and piss on your brain.

958
01:34:43,936 --> 01:34:46,166
- Excuse me.
- You got it.

959
01:34:47,773 --> 01:34:50,128
All right. On your feet. Up! Let's go.

960
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:53,352
Bunch of fucking weirdos!
We're going to take a little walk.

961
01:34:53,613 --> 01:34:56,571
Don't try anything funny
or the whore loses a kidney.

962
01:35:24,691 --> 01:35:27,364
- No, I'm from Sweden.
- Beat it.

963
01:35:27,611 --> 01:35:32,048
Hey, I'm King Kong,
the biggest, baddest guy in the jungle.

964
01:35:32,366 --> 01:35:34,357
Get lost, you maggot.

965
01:35:35,578 --> 01:35:38,411
Hey, who is that guy,
your father or something?

966
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:45,411
All right, hold it right here.

967
01:35:45,631 --> 01:35:48,099
- Honestly, Beeks.
- This is as far as we go.

968
01:35:49,386 --> 01:35:51,695
No more cockamamie cigar smoke.

969
01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:54,649
No more Swedish meatballs there, tootsie.

970
01:35:55,309 --> 01:35:58,460
And no more phoney Irish whisky.

971
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:00,880
No more goddamn jerky beef.

972
01:36:01,691 --> 01:36:03,682
The party's over.

973
01:36:03,902 --> 01:36:07,372
The party's over. Hey, come on.

974
01:36:07,657 --> 01:36:09,648
What do you mean, "The party's over"?

975
01:36:09,867 --> 01:36:12,620
It's not even ten o'clock, you dummy.

976
01:36:12,871 --> 01:36:15,385
Hey, come on. Loosen up, man.

977
01:36:15,624 --> 01:36:17,615
It's almost New Year's Eve.

978
01:36:49,997 --> 01:36:52,557
Hey, look what happened to me!

979
01:37:02,010 --> 01:37:04,604
Sometimes, they look so human,
it gives you the creeps.

980
01:37:07,225 --> 01:37:10,376
Boy, that other one's
getting kinda horny, ain't he?

981
01:37:10,645 --> 01:37:13,876
Think we ought to hit him up
with the tranquilliser gun?

982
01:37:14,149 --> 01:37:16,140
It's New Year's. Let 'em have their fun.

983
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,714
That black one must be the female.

984
01:37:39,929 --> 01:37:44,480
- Where is he?
- Beeks. Are you there, Beeks?

985
01:37:51,692 --> 01:37:53,728
I'm over here.

986
01:37:57,908 --> 01:38:00,217
That's far enough.

987
01:38:00,452 --> 01:38:02,443
Did you get the report?

988
01:38:03,664 --> 01:38:05,894
Let's see the money.

989
01:38:14,176 --> 01:38:16,167
OK, toss it over.

990
01:38:28,026 --> 01:38:30,017
Thank you, Beeks.

991
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:44,124
Wonderful news. Wonderful.

992
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:47,616
Beeks, Happy New Year.

993
01:38:59,311 --> 01:39:03,509
My life savings. Try not to lose it.

994
01:39:03,816 --> 01:39:07,968
Lose it? In a couple of hours, you're going
to be the richest butler that ever lived.

995
01:39:12,785 --> 01:39:16,300
I worked real hard for this, Louis.
Hope you know what you're doing.

996
01:39:17,749 --> 01:39:20,547
- Thank you, Ophelia.
- What are you doing?

997
01:39:22,588 --> 01:39:24,579
10:31…

998
01:39:24,799 --> 01:39:26,790
That's us, Louis.

999
01:39:32,349 --> 01:39:34,499
Coleman, would you please.

1000
01:39:34,727 --> 01:39:36,718
Thank you.

1001
01:40:14,981 --> 01:40:19,452
I could use a stiff drink.
Would you care to join me?

1002
01:40:46,184 --> 01:40:48,778
- Morning, Mr Duke.
- Wilson.

1003
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:51,011
- Good morning, Mr Duke.
- Wilson.

1004
01:41:03,662 --> 01:41:05,653
Keep the change.

1005
01:41:06,874 --> 01:41:10,025
Think big, think positive.
Never show any sign of weakness.

1006
01:41:10,295 --> 01:41:15,244
Always go for the throat. Buy low, sell
high. Fear, that's the other guy's problem.

1007
01:41:15,592 --> 01:41:19,870
Nothing can prepare you for the unbridled
carnage you are about to witness.

1008
01:41:20,181 --> 01:41:22,172
The Super Bowl, the World Series.

1009
01:41:22,392 --> 01:41:27,227
Pressure? Here it's kill or be killed.
Make no friends and take no prisoners.

1010
01:41:27,564 --> 01:41:30,556
One minute you're up half a million,
the next, boom.

1011
01:41:30,818 --> 01:41:33,252
Your kids don't go to college
and you've lost your Bentley.

1012
01:41:33,488 --> 01:41:36,798
We've got to kill the motherfucker…
We've got to kill them.

1013
01:41:37,075 --> 01:41:40,954
We want you to buy as much OJ
as you can, the instant trading starts.

1014
01:41:41,247 --> 01:41:44,876
Don't worry if the price starts going up,
just keep buying.

1015
01:41:45,168 --> 01:41:47,841
They'll broadcast the crop report
in an hour, what if…

1016
01:41:48,088 --> 01:41:50,238
Let us worry about that, Wilson.

1017
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:55,414
Yes, sir.

1018
01:41:59,017 --> 01:42:04,410
- How's the ulcer, Harry?
- Pretty good. How's the hypertension?

1019
01:42:04,774 --> 01:42:06,765
Hasn't bothered me in months.

1020
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:36,841
Let's kick some ass.

1021
01:42:58,085 --> 01:43:01,964
This is it. The last
bastion of pure capitalism left on earth.

1022
01:43:02,256 --> 01:43:06,488
Here in New York they trade everything,
gold, silver, platinum,

1023
01:43:06,803 --> 01:43:09,601
heating oil, propane, cocoa and sugar

1024
01:43:09,848 --> 01:43:12,203
and, of course,
frozen, concentrated orange juice.

1025
01:43:12,434 --> 01:43:16,313
The people on the phones are taking
orders from brokers all over the world.

1026
01:43:16,606 --> 01:43:20,918
The runners hand those
orders to the traders in the pits.

1027
01:43:25,116 --> 01:43:28,506
They're trading cotton over there.
And that's the silver pit.

1028
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:32,567
The Dukes' trader is going to be
buying like crazy right from the opening.

1029
01:43:32,833 --> 01:43:34,824
We wait until he drives the price up?

1030
01:43:35,044 --> 01:43:39,435
Right. I can't wait to see his face, when
they broadcast that genuine crop report.

1031
01:43:39,757 --> 01:43:41,748
OJ trading opens at 9:00.

1032
01:43:41,968 --> 01:43:44,766
- Let's go kick some butt.
- Let's go.

1033
01:44:46,626 --> 01:44:49,936
Hey, hey. The Dukes
are trying to corner the market.

1034
01:44:50,213 --> 01:44:53,205
- They know something.
- Let's get in on it.

1035
01:44:54,384 --> 01:44:55,897
200, taken.

1036
01:44:56,095 --> 01:45:00,054
- 130.
- 200, 200.

1037
01:45:00,391 --> 01:45:02,382
Louis.

1038
01:45:02,602 --> 01:45:04,593
Not yet, almost.

1039
01:45:05,022 --> 01:45:07,092
- 220 taken.
- 209.

1040
01:45:07,316 --> 01:45:10,353
- Yeah, yeah, got 'em.
- 139.

1041
01:45:14,407 --> 01:45:18,116
Now!
Sell, 200 April at 142.

1042
01:45:32,470 --> 01:45:36,463
That's not right.
How can the price be going down?

1043
01:45:36,766 --> 01:45:39,360
Something's wrong. Where's Wilson?

1044
01:45:41,897 --> 01:45:43,888
What are they doing here?

1045
01:45:44,108 --> 01:45:47,896
- They're selling, Mortimer.
- Why, that's ridiculous.

1046
01:45:49,823 --> 01:45:55,102
- Unless that crop report…
- God help us.

1047
01:46:05,549 --> 01:46:08,825
I told you we shouldn't have
committed everything, you asshole.

1048
01:46:09,095 --> 01:46:13,088
We've got to get Wilson
and tell him to sell.

1049
01:46:39,255 --> 01:46:40,654
Ladies and gentlemen,

1050
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:42,671
the Secretary Of Agriculture.

1051
01:46:52,937 --> 01:46:57,169
Ladies and gentlemen, the
orange crop estimates for the next year.

1052
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:15,857
After calculating the estimates from
various orange producing states,

1053
01:47:16,172 --> 01:47:18,128
We have concluded the following…

1054
01:47:18,633 --> 01:47:22,546
The cold winter has apparently
not effected the orange harvest.

1055
01:47:28,311 --> 01:47:32,782
…consumers can expect
orange juice prices to fall…

1056
01:47:40,158 --> 01:47:42,194
Wilson, for Christ's sake, sell.

1057
01:47:54,048 --> 01:47:55,845
Buy 'em.

1058
01:48:30,549 --> 01:48:32,540
Wilson, where are you going?

1059
01:48:32,759 --> 01:48:37,150
You idiot. Get back in there at once
and sell, sell.

1060
01:48:50,488 --> 01:48:52,479
- Five.
- Yeah, 200.

1061
01:48:52,699 --> 01:48:55,497
- 100.
- Yeah, that was 100.

1062
01:48:55,744 --> 01:48:58,622
Did you get that?

1063
01:49:15,475 --> 01:49:17,466
Happy New Year.

1064
01:49:19,438 --> 01:49:22,475
- Winthorpe.
- Valentine.

1065
01:49:22,733 --> 01:49:26,487
- How'd you make out today?
- How could you do this to us,

1066
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:28,771
after everything we've done for you?

1067
01:49:28,990 --> 01:49:31,982
Oh, see I made Louis a bet here.

1068
01:49:32,244 --> 01:49:35,919
Louis bet me that we couldn't get rich
and put you in the poorhouse.

1069
01:49:36,207 --> 01:49:39,005
He didn't think we could do it. I won.

1070
01:49:39,252 --> 01:49:41,243
I lost.

1071
01:49:41,797 --> 01:49:44,595
- One dollar.
- Thank you, Louis.

1072
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:48,251
- After you.
- Certainly.

1073
01:49:52,434 --> 01:49:54,425
Margin call, gentlemen.

1074
01:49:54,645 --> 01:49:57,079
- Why you can't expect…
- You know the rules.

1075
01:49:57,315 --> 01:50:02,230
All accounts to be settled at the end
of the day's trading, without exception.

1076
01:50:02,571 --> 01:50:06,689
You know perfectly well,
we don't have $394 million in cash.

1077
01:50:06,992 --> 01:50:11,907
I'm sorry, boys. Put the Duke brothers'
seats on the exchange up for sale at once.

1078
01:50:12,248 --> 01:50:15,479
Seize all assets of Duke & Duke
Commodity Brokers,

1079
01:50:15,752 --> 01:50:19,301
as well as all personal holdings
of Randolph and Mortimer Duke.

1080
01:50:19,590 --> 01:50:22,627
We're ruined!

1081
01:50:22,885 --> 01:50:25,604
This is an outrage,
I demand an investigation.

1082
01:50:25,847 --> 01:50:30,284
You can't sell our seats. A Duke has been
on this exchange since it was founded.

1083
01:50:30,603 --> 01:50:32,878
We founded this exchange. It's ours.

1084
01:50:33,106 --> 01:50:35,097
It belongs to us.

1085
01:50:36,234 --> 01:50:38,190
We'd better call your brother
an ambulance.

1086
01:50:38,403 --> 01:50:41,793
Fuck him!
I want trading reopened, right now.

1087
01:50:42,074 --> 01:50:45,908
Get those brokers back in here.
Turn those machines back on.

1088
01:50:46,204 --> 01:50:49,002
Turn those machines back on.

1089
01:50:53,379 --> 01:50:57,008
You and your Nobel Prize, you idiot.

1090
01:50:57,300 --> 01:51:00,019
Where's Beeks? Where in hell is Beeks?

1091
01:51:00,262 --> 01:51:02,822
- Beeks!
- Yeah, I forgot all about that guy.

1092
01:51:12,317 --> 01:51:14,751
OK, one male gorilla.

1093
01:51:14,987 --> 01:51:17,547
Wait a minute.
There's two of them in that cage.

1094
01:51:17,782 --> 01:51:21,491
One gorilla, two gorillas. Big deal.
Whole bunch is getting sent back to Africa.

1095
01:51:21,786 --> 01:51:26,098
It's a big scientific experiment.
What do I know? Anyway, they're in love.

1096
01:51:47,274 --> 01:51:50,027
- Hey, Coleman.
- Yes.

1097
01:51:51,529 --> 01:51:54,202
What about lunch?
The lobster or the cracked crab?

1098
01:51:54,449 --> 01:51:57,725
- What do you think?
- Can't we have both?

1099
01:51:57,994 --> 01:51:59,950
Why not?

1100
01:52:00,164 --> 01:52:02,155
- Dimitri.
- Sir.

1101
01:52:02,374 --> 01:52:07,402
- Lobster and cracked crab for everyone.
- Extra prima good, Mr Coleman, sir.

1102
01:52:16,808 --> 01:52:19,276
Looking good, Billy Ray.

1103
01:52:19,519 --> 01:52:21,908
Feeling good, Louis.
