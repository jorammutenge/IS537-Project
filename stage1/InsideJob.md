1<br>00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:10,634<br>Iceland is a stable democracy<br><br>2<br>00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:12,430<br>with a high standard of living,<br><br>3<br>00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:14,071<br>and, until recently,<br><br>4<br>00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,436<br>extremely low unemployment<br>and government debt.<br><br>5<br>00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:23,208<br>We had the complete infrastructure<br>of a modern society.<br><br>6<br>00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:26,073<br>Clean energy, food production.<br><br>7<br>00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:28,685<br>Fisheries with a quota system<br>to manage them.<br><br>8<br>00:01:28,854 --> 00:01:33,188<br>Good healthcare, education,<br>clean air.<br><br>9<br>00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:35,016<br>Not much crime.<br><br>10<br>00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:37,492<br>It's a good place for families to live.<br><br>11<br>00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:41,360<br>We had almost<br>end-of-history status.<br><br>12<br>00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:47,035<br>But in 2000, Iceland's government<br>began a broad policy of deregulation<br><br>13<br>00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:49,868<br>that would have<br>disastrous consequences,<br><br>14<br>00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:54,001<br>first for the environment<br>and then for the economy.<br><br>15<br>00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:57,979<br>They started by allowing multinational<br>corporations like Alcoa<br><br>16<br>00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,516<br>to build giant<br>aluminum-smelting plants<br><br>17<br>00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:05,555<br>and exploit Iceland's geothermal<br>and hydroelectric energy sources.<br><br>18<br>00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:08,925<br>Many of the most beautiful areas<br>in the highlands<br><br>19<br>00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:13,622<br>with the most spectacular colors<br>are geothermal.<br><br>20<br>00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,424<br>So nothing comes<br>without consequence.<br><br>21<br>00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:56,334<br>At the same time,<br><br>22<br>00:02:56,507 --> 00:03:00,170<br>the government privatized<br>Iceland's three largest banks.<br><br>23<br>00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:02,835<br>The result was one of<br>the purest experiments<br><br>24<br>00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:05,983<br>in financial deregulation<br>ever conducted.<br><br>25<br>00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:14,655<br>We have had enough.<br>How could all of this happen?<br><br>26<br>00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,593<br>Finance took over and more<br>or less wrecked the place.<br><br>27<br>00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:24,330<br>In a five-year period,<br>these three tiny banks,<br><br>28<br>00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:26,970<br>which had never operated<br>outside of Iceland,<br><br>29<br>00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:30,039<br>borrowed 120 billion dollars,<br><br>30<br>00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:33,301<br>10 times the size<br>of Iceland's economy.<br><br>31<br>00:03:33,477 --> 00:03:35,707<br>The bankers showered money<br>on themselves,<br><br>32<br>00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,780<br>each other, and their friends.<br><br>33<br>00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:39,610<br>There was a massive bubble.<br><br>34<br>00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:43,151<br>Stock prices went up<br>by a factor of nine.<br><br>35<br>00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:45,516<br>House prices more than doubled.<br><br>36<br>00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:56,796<br>He borrowed billions to buy up<br>high-end retail businesses in London.<br><br>37<br>00:03:56,968 --> 00:03:59,197<br>He also bought<br>a pinstriped private jet,<br><br>38<br>00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,132<br>a 40-million-dollar yacht<br><br>39<br>00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:03,397<br>and a Manhattan penthouse.<br><br>40<br>00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:05,404<br>Newspapers<br>always had the headline:<br><br>41<br>00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:08,601<br>This millionaire bought<br>this company<br><br>42<br>00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:13,943<br>in the U.K. Or in Finland<br>or in France or wherever,<br><br>43<br>00:04:14,117 --> 00:04:15,414<br>instead of saying:<br><br>44<br>00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:19,351<br>"This millionaire took<br>a billion-dollar loan<br><br>45<br>00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:23,856<br>to buy this company,<br>and he took it from your local bank."<br><br>46<br>00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:25,995<br>The banks set<br>up money market funds,<br><br>47<br>00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:29,359<br>and the banks advised<br>deposit-holders to withdraw money<br><br>48<br>00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:31,762<br>and put them<br>in the money market funds.<br><br>49<br>00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:34,369<br>The Ponzi scheme needed<br>everything it could.<br><br>50<br>00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:37,631<br>American<br>accounting firms like KPMG<br><br>51<br>00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:40,275<br>audited the Icelandic banks<br>and investment firms<br><br>52<br>00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:42,240<br>and found nothing wrong.<br><br>53<br>00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:46,041<br>And American credit-rating agencies<br>said Iceland was wonderful.<br><br>54<br>00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:48,650<br>In February 2007,<br><br>55<br>00:04:48,818 --> 00:04:54,848<br>the rating agency upgraded the banks to<br>the highest possible rate, triple-A.<br><br>56<br>00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:59,928<br>It went so far as the government here<br>traveling with the bankers<br><br>57<br>00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:02,963<br>as a PR show.<br><br>58<br>00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:08,763<br>When Iceland's banks collapsed<br>at the end of 2008,<br><br>59<br>00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:12,237<br>unemployment tripled<br>in six months.<br><br>60<br>00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:18,747<br>There is nobody<br>unaffected in Iceland.<br><br>61<br>00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:26,321<br>A lot of people lost their savings.<br><br>62<br>00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:28,582<br>Yes, that's the case.<br><br>63<br>00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:32,591<br>Government regulators who<br>should've been protecting the citizens<br><br>64<br>00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:34,592<br>had done nothing.<br><br>65<br>00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:39,124<br>You have two lawyers from<br>the regulator going down to a bank<br><br>66<br>00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:41,201<br>to talk about some issue.<br><br>67<br>00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,997<br>When they approach the bank,<br><br>68<br>00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:48,474<br>they would see 19 SUVs<br>outside the bank.<br><br>69<br>00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:49,804<br>You enter the bank,<br><br>70<br>00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:54,176<br>and you have the 19 lawyers<br>sitting in front of you, right,<br><br>71<br>00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:59,719<br>very well prepared,<br>ready to kill any argument you make.<br><br>72<br>00:05:59,888 --> 00:06:02,982<br>And then, if you do really well,<br>they'll offer you a job.<br><br>73<br>00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:06,451<br>One-third of Iceland's<br>financial regulators<br><br>74<br>00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:09,028<br>went to work for the banks.<br><br>75<br>00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:12,256<br>But this is<br>a universal problem, huh?<br><br>76<br>00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:15,164<br>In New York,<br>you have the same problem, right?<br><br>77<br>00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:49,199<br>What do you think of<br>Wall Street incomes these days?<br><br>78<br>00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,861<br>Excessive.<br><br>79<br>00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:56,235<br>I've been told it's<br>extremely difficult for the IMF<br><br>80<br>00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:58,436<br>to criticize the United States.<br><br>81<br>00:06:58,614 --> 00:06:59,740<br>I wouldn't say that.<br><br>82<br>00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:10,354<br>We deeply regret our breaches<br>of U.S. Law.<br><br>83<br>00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:17,997<br>They're amazed at how much<br>cocaine these Wall Streeters can use<br><br>84<br>00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,327<br>and get up<br>and go to work the next day.<br><br>85<br>00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:27,264<br>I didn't know<br>what credit default swaps are.<br><br>86<br>00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:29,068<br>I'm a little bit old-fashioned.<br><br>87<br>00:07:34,448 --> 00:07:36,916<br>Has Larry Summers<br>ever expressed remorse?<br><br>88<br>00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:38,881<br>I don't hear confessions.<br><br>89<br>00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:55,468<br>The government's<br>just writing checks.<br><br>90<br>00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:58,901<br>That's plan A, that's plan B<br>and that's plan C.<br><br>91<br>00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:02,941<br>Would you support<br>legal controls on executive pay?<br><br>92<br>00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:04,805<br>I would not.<br><br>93<br>00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:10,337<br>Are you<br>comfortable with the<br><br>94<br>00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,249<br>level of compensation<br>in financial services?<br><br>95<br>00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,887<br>If they've earned it,<br>yes, I am.<br><br>96<br>00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:16,114<br>Do you think they've earned it?<br>I think so.<br><br>97<br>00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,290<br>And so you've helped<br>these people blow the world up?<br><br>98<br>00:08:22,463 --> 00:08:23,487<br>You could say that.<br><br>99<br>00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:37,738<br>They were having massive<br>private gains at public loss.<br><br>100<br>00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:48,479<br>When you think you can<br>create something out of nothing<br><br>101<br>00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:50,122<br>it's difficult to resist.<br><br>102<br>00:09:05,038 --> 00:09:08,166<br>I'm concerned people<br>want to go back to the old way,<br><br>103<br>00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:11,003<br>the way they were operating<br>prior to the crisis.<br><br>104<br>00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:25,188<br>I was getting a lot of anonymous<br>e-mails from bankers saying:<br><br>105<br>00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:28,122<br>"You can't quote me,<br>but I'm really concerned."<br><br>106<br>00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:35,862<br>Why do you think there isn't<br><br>107<br>00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:38,732<br>a more systematic investigation<br>being undertaken?<br><br>108<br>00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:40,873<br>Because then<br>you'll find the culprits.<br><br>109<br>00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,479<br>You think<br>Columbia Business.<br><br>110<br>00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:48,772<br>School has any<br>conflict-of-interest problem?<br><br>111<br>00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:51,777<br>I don't see that we do.<br><br>112<br>00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:02,788<br>The regulators<br>didn't do their job.<br><br>113<br>00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:06,899<br>They had the power to do every case<br>that I made. They just didn't want to.<br><br>114<br>00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:27,278<br>Lehman Brothers, one<br>of the most venerable<br><br>115<br>00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:30,820<br>and biggest investment banks,<br>was forced to declare itself bankrupt.<br><br>116<br>00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,084<br>Another, Merrill Lynch,<br>was forced to sell itself today.<br><br>117<br>00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,423<br>World financial markets are way down,<br>following dramatic developments.<br><br>118<br>00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:48,764<br>In September 2008,<br><br>119<br>00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:51,933<br>the bankruptcy of the U.S.<br>Investment bank Lehman Brothers<br><br>120<br>00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:56,343<br>and the collapse of the world's<br>largest insurance company, AIG,<br><br>121<br>00:10:56,515 --> 00:10:58,039<br>triggered a global crisis.<br><br>122<br>00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:00,412<br>Fears gripped markets overnight.<br><br>123<br>00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,076<br>Stocks fell off a cliff.<br><br>124<br>00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:05,087<br>The largest single point drop<br>in history.<br><br>125<br>00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:07,225<br>Share prices continued to tumble<br><br>126<br>00:11:07,393 --> 00:11:10,590<br>in the aftermath<br>of the Lehman collapse.<br><br>127<br>00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,663<br>The result was a global recession,<br><br>128<br>00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,700<br>which cost the world<br>tens of trillions of dollars,<br><br>129<br>00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,100<br>rendered 30 million people<br>unemployed<br><br>130<br>00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:23,537<br>and doubled the national debt<br>of the United States.<br><br>131<br>00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:28,874<br>With the destruction<br>of equity and housing wealth,<br><br>132<br>00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:31,539<br>the destruction of income,<br>of jobs,<br><br>133<br>00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:37,155<br>50 million people globally could<br>end up below the poverty line again.<br><br>134<br>00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:41,857<br>This is just a hugely,<br>hugely expensive crisis.<br><br>135<br>00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:45,288<br>This crisis was not an accident.<br><br>136<br>00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:48,661<br>It was caused<br>by an out-of-control industry.<br><br>137<br>00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,027<br>Since the 1980s,<br><br>138<br>00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:53,295<br>the rise of the U.S. Financial sector<br>has led to a series<br><br>139<br>00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,565<br>of increasingly severe<br>financial crises.<br><br>140<br>00:11:56,808 --> 00:11:59,800<br>Each crisis has caused<br>more damage,<br><br>141<br>00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:03,811<br>while the industry has made<br>more and more money.<br><br>142<br>00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:13,480<br>After the Great Depression<br><br>143<br>00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:16,525<br>the United States had 40 years<br>of economic growth<br><br>144<br>00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,992<br>without a single financial crisis.<br><br>145<br>00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:22,030<br>The financial industry<br>was tightly regulated.<br><br>146<br>00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,566<br>Most regular banks<br>were local

00:12:39,107<br>In the traditional<br>investment banking model,<br><br>152<br>00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,513<br>the partners put the money up,<br><br>153<br>00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:45,122<br>and they watch that money<br>very carefully.<br><br>154<br>00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:46,756<br>They wanted to live well,<br><br>155<br>00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:49,722<br>but they didn't want to bet the ranch<br>on

a year.<br><br>162<br>00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:13,716<br>Forty-five thousand dollars a year.<br><br>163<br>00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:17,048<br>Morgan Stanley, in 1972,<br><br>164<br>00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:21,851<br>had approximately<br>110 total personnel,<br><br>165<br>00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:26,428<br>one office,<br>and capital of 12 million dollars.<br><br>166<br>00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:31,056<br>Now Morgan Stanley<br>has 50,000 workers<br><br>167<br>00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:35,227<br>and has capital of several billion<br><br>168<br>00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:37,965<br>and has offices all over the world.<br><br>169<br>00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:41,577<br>In the 1980s,<br>the financial industry exploded.<br><br>170<br>00:13:41,745 --> 00:13:43,576<br>The investment banks<br>went public,<br><br>171<br>00:13:43,747 --> 00:13:47,046<br>giving them huge amounts<br>of stockholder money.<br><br>172<br>00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:50,550<br>People on Wall Street<br>started getting rich.<br><br>173<br>00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:54,490<br>I had a friend<br>who was a bond trader<br><br>174<br>00:13:54,658 --> 00:13:58,651<br>at Merrill Lynch in the 1970s.<br><br>175<br>00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:02,594<br>He had a job as a train conductor<br>at night<br><br>176<br>00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:06,202<br>because he had three kids<br>and couldn't support them<br><br>177<br>00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:07,768<br>on what a trader made.<br><br>178<br>00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:11,601<br>By 1986,<br>he was making millions of dollars<br><br>179<br>00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:14,471<br>and thought<br>it was because he was smart.<br><br>180<br>00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:17,806<br>The highest order of business<br>before the nation<br><br>181<br>00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:20,347<br>is to restore<br>our economic prosperity.<br><br>182<br>00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:25,011<br>In 1981, President Ronald<br>Reagan chose as Treasury secretary<br><br>183<br>00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:28,680<br>the CEO of the investment bank<br>Merrill Lynch, Donald Regan.<br><br>184<br>00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:32,123<br>Wall Street and the president<br>see eye to eye.<br><br>185<br>00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:34,797<br>I've talked to leaders of Wall Street.<br><br>186<br>00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:37,695<br>They say, "We're behind<br>the president 100 percent."<br><br>187<br>00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,334<br>The Reagan administration,<br><br>188<br>00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:42,266<br>supported by economists<br>and financial lobbyists,<br><br>189<br>00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:46,375<br>started a 30-year period<br>of financial deregulation.<br><br>190<br>00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:50,271<br>In 1982,<br>the Reagan administration<br><br>191<br>00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:52,938<br>deregulated<br>savings-and-loan companies,<br><br>192<br>00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:56,677<br>allowing them to make risky<br>investments with depositors' money.<br><br>193<br>00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:58,285<br>By the end of the decade,<br><br>194<br>00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:01,548<br>hundreds of savings-and-loan<br>companies had failed.<br><br>195<br>00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:05,660<br>This crisis cost taxpayers<br>$ 124 billion<br><br>196<br>00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:08,793<br>and cost many people<br>their life savings.<br><br>197<br>00:15:08,964 --> 00:15:12,195<br>It may be the biggest bank heist<br>in our history.<br><br>198<br>00:15:12,368 --> 00:15:16,566<br>Thousands of executives went to jail<br>for looting their companies.<br><br>199<br>00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:19,333<br>One of the most extreme cases<br>was Charles Keating.<br><br>200<br>00:15:19,508 --> 00:15:20,839<br>Mr. Keating, got a word?<br><br>201<br>00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,276<br>In 1985, when federal regulators<br>began investigating him,<br><br>202<br>00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:29,076<br>Keating hired an economist<br>named Alan Greenspan.<br><br>203<br>00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:30,912<br>In this letter to regulators,<br><br>204<br>00:15:31,086 --> 00:15:34,647<br>Greenspan praised Keating's<br>sound business plans and expertise<br><br>205<br>00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:39,624<br>and said he saw no risk in allowing<br>Keating to invest customers' money.<br><br>206<br>00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:44,960<br>Keating reportedly<br>paid Greenspan $40,000.<br><br>207<br>00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:49,003<br>Keating went to prison<br>shortly afterwards.<br><br>208<br>00:15:49,571 --> 00:15:50,833<br>As for Alan Greenspan,<br><br>209<br>00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:55,110<br>Reagan appointed him<br>chairman of America's central bank,<br><br>210<br>00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:56,835<br>the Federal Reserve.<br><br>211<br>00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:58,536<br>Greenspan was reappointed<br><br>212<br>00:15:58,714 --> 00:16:02,411<br>by presidents Clinton<br>and George W. Bush.<br><br>213<br>00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:05,152<br>During the Clinton administration,<br><br>214<br>00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:07,585<br>deregulation continued<br>under Greenspan<br><br>215<br>00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:10,316<br>and Treasury secretaries<br>Robert Rubin,<br><br>216<br>00:16:10,492 --> 00:16:13,859<br>the former CEO of the<br>investment bank Goldman Sachs,<br><br>217<br>00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:17,521<br>and Larry Summers,<br>a Harvard economics Professor.<br><br>218<br>00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,760<br>The financial sector,<br>Wall Street being powerful,<br><br>219<br>00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:22,904<br>having lobbies, lots of money,<br><br>220<br>00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:26,564<br>step by step,<br>captured the political system.<br><br>221<br>00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:29,678<br>Both on the Democratic<br>and the Republican side.<br><br>222<br>00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:34,106<br>By the late 1990s, the<br>financial sector had consolidated<br><br>223<br>00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:37,774<br>into a few gigantic firms,<br>each of them so large<br><br>224<br>00:16:37,952 --> 00:16:40,978<br>that their failure could threaten<br>the whole system.<br><br>225<br>00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:44,750<br>And the Clinton administration<br>helped them grow even larger.<br><br>226<br>00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:48,693<br>In 1998,<br>Citicorp and Travelers merged<br><br>227<br>00:16:48,863 --> 00:16:50,228<br>to form Citigroup,<br><br>228<br>00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:53,265<br>the largest financial services<br>company in the world.<br><br>229<br>00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:56,002<br>The merger violated<br>the Glass-Steagall Act,<br><br>230<br>00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,502<br>a law passed<br>after the Great Depression,<br><br>231<br>00:16:58,673 --> 00:17:01,005<br>preventing banks<br>with consumer deposits<br><br>232<br>00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:04,406<br>from engaging in<br>risky investment-banking activities.<br><br>233<br>00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,412<br>It was illegal<br>to acquire Travelers.<br><br>234<br>00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:09,345<br>Greenspan said nothing.<br><br>235<br>00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:12,452<br>The Federal Reserve gave them<br>an exemption for a year,<br><br>236<br>00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,417<br>then they got the law passed.<br><br>237<br>00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:18,419<br>In 1999,<br>at the urging of Summers and Rubin,<br><br>238<br>00:17:18,593 --> 00:17:21,221<br>Congress passed<br>the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,<br><br>239<br>00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:24,422<br>known to some<br>as the Citigroup Relief Act.<br><br>240<br>00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,726<br>It overturned Glass-Steagall<br><br>241<br>00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:29,893<br>and cleared the way<br>for future mergers.<br><br>242<br>00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:39,674<br>Why do you have big banks?<br><br>243<br>00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:43,874<br>Because banks like monopoly power,<br>lobbying power.<br><br>244<br>00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:48,545<br>Because banks know<br>that when they're too big,<br><br>245<br>00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:49,985<br>they will be bailed.<br><br>246<br>00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:52,626<br>Markets are inherently unstable.<br><br>247<br>00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:55,228<br>Or at least potentially unstable.<br><br>248<br>00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:59,230<br>An appropriate metaphor<br>is the oil tankers.<br><br>249<br>00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,697<br>They are very big,<br><br>250<br>00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:03,731<br>and therefore,<br>you have to put in compartments<br><br>251<br>00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:07,401<br>to prevent<br>the sloshing around of oil<br><br>252<br>00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:09,405<br>from capsizing the boat.<br><br>253<br>00:18:09,576 --> 00:18:12,909<br>The design of the boat<br>has to take that into account.<br><br>254<br>00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,048<br>And after the Depression,<br><br>255<br>00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:21,916<br>the regulations actually introduced<br>these very watertight compartments.<br><br>256<br>00:18:22,556 --> 00:18:28,392<br>And deregulation has led<br>to the end of compartmentalization.<br><br>257<br>00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:31,426<br>The next crisis<br>came at the end of the '90s.<br><br>258<br>00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:35,891<br>The investment banks fueled<br>a massive bubble in Internet stocks,<br><br>259<br>00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:38,765<br>which was followed by a crash<br>in 2001<br><br>260<br>00:18:38,939 --> 00:18:41,840<br>that caused $5 trillion<br>in investment losses.<br><br>261<br>00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:45,606<br>The Securities and Exchange<br>Commission, the federal agency<br><br>262<br>00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:49,237<br>created during the Depression<br>to regulate investment banking,<br><br>263<br>00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,077<br>had done nothing.<br><br>264<br>00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:54,880<br>In the absence of meaningful<br>federal action,<br><br>265<br>00:18:55,055 --> 00:18:57,580<br>and given the clear failure<br>of self-regulation,<br><br>266<br>00:18:57,757 --> 00:19:00,282<br>it's become necessary for others<br>to step in<br><br>267<br>00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,360<br>and adopt the protections needed.<br><br>268<br>00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:05,692<br>Eliot Spitzer's investigation<br>revealed the investment banks<br><br>269<br>00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:09,302<br>promoted Internet companies<br>they knew would fail.<br><br>270<br>00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:13,030<br>Analysts were being paid based on<br>how much business they brought in.<br><br>271<br>00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:17,540<br>What they said publicly was quite<br>different from what they said privately.<br><br>272<br>00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:20,179<br>Infospace, given the<br>highest possible rating,<br><br>273<br>00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:22,872<br>dismissed by an analyst<br>as a "piece of junk."<br><br>274<br>00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:27,110<br>Excite, also highly rated,<br>called "such a piece of crap."<br><br>275<br>00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:33,624<br>The defense that was proffered<br>by many of the investment banks<br><br>276<br>00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,520<br>was not "you're wrong,"<br><br>277<br>00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:40,154<br>it was, "Everybody's doing it,<br>everybody knows it's going on."<br><br>278<br>00:19:40,332 --> 00:19:42,459<br>Nobody should rely<br>on these analysts anyway."<br><br>279<br>00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:44,960<br>In December, 2002,<br><br>280<br>00:19:45,137 --> 00:19:49,665<br>10 investment banks settled<br>the case for a total of $ 1.4 billion<br><br>281<br>00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:52,572<br>and promised<br>to change their ways.<br><br>282<br>00:19:52,978 -->

groups,<br><br>284<br>00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:03,453<br>which represents nearly all of the<br>world's largest financial companies.<br><br>285<br>00:20:03,622 --> 00:20:07,524<br>Are you comfortable with the<br>fact that several of your member companies<br><br>286<br>00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:10,685<br>have engaged<br>in large-scale criminal activity?<br><br>287<br>00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:12,922<br>L... You'll have to be specific.<br>Okay.<br><br>288<br>00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:16,966<br>And first of all, criminal activity<br>shouldn't be accepted, period.<br><br>289<br>00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:28,810<br>Since deregulation began,<br>the world's biggest financial firms<br><br>290<br>00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:32,178<br>have been caught laundering<br>money, defrauding customers<br><br>291<br>00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:36,287<br>and cooking their books<br>again and again and again.<br><br>292<br>00:20:47,132 --> 00:20:50,795<br>Credit Suisse helped funnel money<br>for Iran's nuclear program<br><br>293<br>00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,461<br>and for Iran's<br>Aerospace Industries Organization,<br><br>294<br>00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:55,402<br>which builds ballistic missiles.<br><br>295<br>00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:59,806<br>Any information that would identify it<br>as Iranian would be removed.<br><br>296<br>00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:03,039<br>The bank was fined $536 million.<br><br>297<br>00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:07,151<br>Citibank helped funnel $ 100 million<br>of drug money out of Mexico.<br><br>298<br>00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:09,879<br>Did you comment<br>that she

was at the early stages of this.<br><br>301<br>00:21:16,694 --> 00:21:18,059<br>I did not mean it seriously.<br><br>302<br>00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:23,231<br>Between 1998 and 2003,<br><br>303<br>00:21:23,401 --> 00:21:26,734<br>Fannie Mae overstated it's earnings<br>by more than $ 10 billion.<br><br>304<br>00:21:26,904 --> 00:21:29,031<br>These accounting standards<br>are complex<br><br>305<br>00:21:29,207 --> 00:21:33,041<br>and require determinations<br>over which experts often disagree.<br><br>306<br>00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:37,375<br>CEO Franklin Raines, who used to

helping<br>wealthy Americans evade taxes,<br><br>309<br>00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:51,318<br>they refused to cooperate<br>with the government.<br><br>310<br>00:21:51,496 --> 00:21:53,794<br>Would you be willing<br>to supply the names?<br><br>311<br>00:21:54,332 --> 00:21:57,426<br>If there's a treaty framework.<br>No treaty framework.<br><br>312<br>00:21:57,602 --> 00:21:59,695<br>You've agreed<br>you participated in a fraud.<br><br>313<br>00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:00,895<br>Hm.<br><br>314<br>00:22:11,315 --> 00:22:13,715<br>But while the companies<br>face unprecedented fines,<br><br>315<br>00:22:13,885 --> 00:22:17,753<br>the investment firms do not<br>have to admit any wrongdoing.<br><br>316<br>00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:22,120<br>When dealing with this many products,<br>this many customers, mistakes happen.<br><br>317<br>00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:24,699<br>The financial<br>services industry<br><br>318<br>00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:27,128<br>seems to have a level<br>of criminality<br><br>319<br>00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:29,266<br>that is somewhat distinctive.<br><br>320<br>00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:33,131<br>You know, when was the last time<br>that Cisco<br><br>321<br>00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:37,434<br>or Intel or Google or Apple or IBM,<br>you know...?<br><br>322<br>00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:40,304<br>I agree about high-tech<br>versus financial services...<br><br>323<br>00:22:40,478 --> 00:22:43,879<br>So how come?<br>High-tech is a creative business<br><br>324<br>00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:45,948<br>where the value generation<br><br>325<br>00:22:46,117 --> 00:22:49,352<br>and income derives from<br>actually creating something new.<br><br>326<br>00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,019<br>Beginning in the 1990s,<br><br>327<br>00:22:52,189 --> 00:22:54,885<br>deregulation<br>and advances in technology<br><br>328<br>00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:59,222<br>led to an explosion of complex<br>financial products called derivatives.<br><br>329<br>00:22:59,396 --> 00:23:02,832<br>Economists and bankers<br>claimed they made markets safer.<br><br>330<br>00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:06,457<br>But instead,<br>they made them unstable.<br><br>331<br>00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,934<br>Since the end of the Cold War,<br><br>332<br>00:23:09,106 --> 00:23:12,098<br>a lot of former physicists,<br>mathematicians,<br><br>333<br>00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:14,436<br>decided to apply their skills,<br><br>334<br>00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:17,341<br>not on, you know,<br>Cold War technology,<br><br>335<br>00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:19,379<br>but on financial markets.<br><br>336<br>00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:21,676<br>And together<br>with investment bankers...<br><br>337<br>00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:23,149<br>Creating different weapons.<br><br>338<br>00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,344<br>Absolutely.<br><br>339<br>00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:27,490<br>You know, as Warren Buffett said,<br>weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>340<br>00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:30,990<br>Regulators, politicians,<br>business people<br><br>341<br>00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:34,756<br>did not take seriously<br>the threat of innovation<br><br>342<br>00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:37,627<br>on the stability<br>of the financial system.<br><br>343<br>00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:39,532<br>Using derivatives,<br><br>344<br>00:23:39,703 --> 00:23:42,501<br>bankers could gamble<br>on virtually anything.<br><br>345<br>00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,334<br>They could bet on the rise or fall<br>of oil prices,<br><br>346<br>00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:48,376<br>the bankruptcy of a company,<br>even the weather.<br><br>347<br>00:23:49,112 --> 00:23:50,807<br>By the late 1990s,<br><br>348<br>00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:55,975<br>derivatives were a 50-trillion-dollar<br>unregulated market.<br><br>349<br>00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,881<br>In 1998,<br>someone tried to regulate them.<br><br>350<br>00:24:01,057 --> 00:24:04,959<br>Brooksley Born graduated first<br>in her class at Stanford Law School<br><br>351<br>00:24:05,128 --> 00:24:08,461<br>and was the first woman<br>to edit a major law review.<br><br>352<br>00:24:08,632 --> 00:24:11,760<br>After running the derivatives practice<br>at Arnold & Porter,<br><br>353<br>00:24:11,935 --> 00:24:13,800<br>Born was appointed by Clinton<br><br>354<br>00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,837<br>to chair the Commodity Futures<br>Trading Commission,<br><br>355<br>00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:19,601<br>which oversaw<br>the derivatives market.<br><br>356<br>00:24:19,776 --> 00:24:23,336<br>Brooksley Born asked<br>me if I would come work with her.<br><br>357<br>00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:27,677<br>We decided that this was a serious,<br><br>358<br>00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,183<br>potentially destabilizing market.<br><br>359<br>00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:36,791<br>In May of 1998, the CFTC issued<br>a proposal to regulate derivatives.<br><br>360<br>00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:40,156<br>Clinton's Treasury Department<br>had an immediate response.<br><br>361<br>00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:44,891<br>I happened to go<br>into Brooksley's office,<br><br>362<br>00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:49,094<br>and she was just putting down<br>the receiver on her telephone,<br><br>363<br>00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:53,002<br>and the blood had drained<br>from her face.<br><br>364<br>00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:56,542<br>And she looked at me and said,<br>"That was Larry Summers."<br><br>365<br>00:24:56,712 --> 00:24:59,909<br>He had 13 bankers in his office.<br><br>366<br>00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:04,082<br>He conveyed it<br>in a very bullying fashion,<br><br>367<br>00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,518<br>sort of directing her to stop.<br><br>368<br>00:25:07,957 --> 00:25:11,449<br>Banks were now reliant for earnings<br>on these activities.<br><br>369<br>00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:17,997<br>And that led to a Titanic battle<br>to prevent this from being regulated.<br><br>370<br>00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:20,533<br>Shortly after the phone call<br>from Summers,<br><br>371<br>00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:24,935<br>Greenspan, Rubin,<br>and SEC chairman Arthur Levitt<br><br>372<br>00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,507<br>issued a joint statement<br>condemning Born<br><br>373<br>00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:32,272<br>and recommending legislation<br>to keep derivatives unregulated.<br><br>374<br>00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:35,616<br>Regulation of<br>derivatives transactions<br><br>375<br>00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:40,653<br>that are privately negotiated<br>by professionals is unnecessary.<br><br>376<br>00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:45,419<br>She was overruled, unfortunately.<br>First by the Clinton administration<br><br>377<br>00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:47,255<br>and then by the Congress.<br><br>378<br>00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:51,456<br>In 2000, Senator Phil Gramm took<br>a major role in getting a bill passed<br><br>379<br>00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,694<br>that pretty much exempted<br>derivatives from regulation.<br><br>380<br>00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:58,566<br>They are unifying markets,<br>reducing regulatory burden.<br><br>381<br>00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,537<br>I believe we need to do it.<br><br>382<br>00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:10,951<br>It is our very great hope<br><br>383<br>00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,555<br>that it will be possible<br>to move this year<br><br>384<br>00:26:14,722 --> 00:26:17,816<br>on legislation that,<br>in a suitable way<br><br>385<br>00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:24,329<br>goes to create legal certainty<br>for OTC derivatives.<br><br>386<br>00:26:30,972 --> 00:26:32,769<br>I wish to associate myself<br><br>387<br>00:26:32,941 --> 00:26:36,206<br>with all the remarks<br>of Secretary Summers.<br><br>388<br>00:26:36,611 --> 00:26:39,444<br>In December of<br>2000, Congress passed<br><br>389<br>00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:42,412<br>the Commodity Futures<br>Modernization Act.<br><br>390<br>00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:45,518<br>Written with the help<br>of financial-industry lobbyists,<br><br>391<br>00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,747<br>it banned the regulation<br>of derivatives.<br><br>392<br>00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,785<br>After that, it was off to the races.<br><br>393<br>00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,489<br>Use of derivatives<br>and financial innovation<br><br>394<br>00:26:56,664 --> 00:26:59,030<br>exploded dramatically after 2000.<br><br>395<br>00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,691<br>So help me God.<br>So help me God.<br><br>396<br>00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:05,566<br>By the time George W. Bush<br>took office in 2001,<br><br>397<br>00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,766<br>the U.S. Financial sector<br>was vastly more profitable,<br><br>398<br>00:27:08,943 --> 00:27:12,743<br>concentrated and powerful<br>than ever before.<br><br>399<br>00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:16,781<br>Dominating this industry<br>were five investment banks,<br><br>400<br>00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:19,215<br>two financial conglomerates,<br><br>401<br>00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:22,049<br>three securities insurance<br>companies<br><br>402<br>00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,521<br>and three rating agencies.<br><br>403<br>00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:28,626<br>And linking them all together<br>was the securitization food chain.<br><br>404<br>00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:31,662<br>A new system<br>which connected trillions of dollars<br><br>405<br>00:27:31,832 --> 00:27:36,326<br>in mortgages and other loans<br>with investors all over the world.<br><br>406<br>00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:39,165<br>Thirty years ago, if you went<br>to get a loan for a home,<br><br>407<br>00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:43,036<br>the person lending you the money<br>expected you to pay him or her back.<br><br>408<br>00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,145<br>You got a loan from a lender<br>who wanted to be paid back.<br><br>409<br>00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:50,147<br>We've since developed securitization,<br>whereby people who make the loan<br><br>410<br>00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:52,751<br>are no longer at risk<br>if they fail to repay.<br><br>411<br>00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,122<br>In the old system, when a homeowner<br>paid their mortgage every month,<br><br>412<br>00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,758<br>the money went<br>to their local lender.<br><br>413<br>00:27:59,926 --> 00:28:04,920<br>And since mortgages took decades<br>to repay, lenders were careful.<br><br>414<br>00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:09,759<br>In the new system, lenders sold<br>mortgages to investment banks.<br><br>415<br>00:28:09,936 --> 00:28:13,303<br>The banks combined<br>thousands of mortgages and loans,<br><br>416<br>00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:17,534<br>including car loans, student loans,<br>and credit card debt,<br><br>417<br>00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:21,875<br>to create complex derivatives called<br>collateralized debt obligations,<br><br>418<br>00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:23,778<br>or CDOs.<br><br>419<br>00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,819<br>The investment banks then sold<br>the CDOs to investors.<br><br>420<br>00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:31,287<br>Now when homeowners paid<br>their mortgages,<br><br>421<br>00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:34,552<br>the money went to investors<br>all over the world.<br><br>422<br>00:28:34,828 --> 00:28:37,296<br>The investment banks<br>paid rating agencies<br><br>423<br>00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:39,159<br>to evaluate the CDOs,<br><br>424<br>00:28:39,332 --> 00:28:41,994<br>and many of them<br>were given a triple-A rating,<br><br>425<br>00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:44,797<br>which is the highest possible<br>investment grade.<br><br>426<br>00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:47,997<br>This made CDOs popular<br>with retirement funds,<br><br>427<br>00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:51,941<br>which could only purchase<br>highly rated securities.<br><br>428<br>00:28:53,613 --> 00:28:56,446<br>This system<br>was a ticking time bomb.<br><br>429<br>00:28:56,616 --> 00:29:00,279<br>Lenders didn't care anymore about<br>whether a borrower could repay,<br><br>430<br>00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:03,150<br>so they started making<br>riskier loans.<br><br>431<br>00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:05,484<br>The investment banks<br>didn't care either.<br><br>432<br>00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:09,389<br>The more CDOs they sold,<br>the higher their profits.<br><br>433<br>00:29:09,562 --> 00:29:13,123<br>And the rating agencies, which<br>were paid by the investment banks,<br><br>434<br>00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:17,759<br>had no liability if their ratings<br>of CDOs proved wrong.<br><br>435<br>00:29:18,904 --> 00:29:23,136<br>You weren't gonna be on the hook,<br>there weren't regulatory constraints.<br><br>436<br>00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:26,506<br>So it was a green light to just<br>pump out more and more loans.<br><br>437<br>00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:29,812<br>Between 2000 and 2003,<br><br>438<br>00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:34,749<br>the number of mortgage loans<br>made each year nearly quadrupled.<br><br>439<br>00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,855<br>Everybody in this<br>securitization food chain,<br><br>440<br>00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:40,514<br>from the very beginning<br>until the end,<br><br>441<br>00:29:40,693 --> 00:29:43,025<br>didn't care about<br>the quality of the mortgage.<br><br>442<br>00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:45,720<br>They were caring<br>about maximizing their volume<br><br>443<br>00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:47,661<br>and getting a fee out of it.<br><br>444<br>00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,323<br>In the early 2000s,<br><br>445<br>00:29:49,502 --> 00:29:54,235<br>there was a huge increase in the<br>riskiest loans, called subprime.<br><br>446<br>00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:58,968<br>When thousands of subprime loans<br>were combined to create CDOs,<br><br>447<br>00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:02,774<br>many of them still received<br>triple-A ratings.<br><br>448<br>00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:09,478<br>Now, it would have been<br>possible to create derivative products<br><br>449<br>00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:11,885<br>that don't have these risks,<br><br>450<br>00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:14,457<br>that carry the equivalent<br>of deductibles,<br><br>451<br>00:30:14,627 --> 00:30:19,428<br>where there are limits on the risks<br>that can be taken on, and so forth.<br><br>452<br>00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:22,032<br>They didn't do that, did they?<br>They didn't.<br><br>453<br>00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:24,066<br>In retrospect,<br>they should've done.<br><br>454<br>00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:27,148<br>So did these guys know<br>they were doing something dangerous?<br><br>455<br>00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:28,470<br>I think they did.<br><br>456<br>00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:51,251<br>All the incentives financial institutions<br>offered to their mortgage brokers<br><br>457<br>00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:55,024<br>were based on selling<br>the most profitable products,<br><br>458<br>00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,827<br>which were predatory loans.<br><br>459<br>00:30:57,168 --> 00:31:01,339<br>If they make more money,<br>that's where they'll put you.<br><br>460<br>00:31:07,178 --> 00:31:10,170<br>Suddenly, hundreds<br>of billions of dollars a year<br><br>461<br>00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:13,146<br>were flowing through<br>the securitization chain.<br><br>462<br>00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:15,183<br>Since anyone could get<br>a mortgage,<br><br>463<br>00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:18,379<br>home purchases<br>and housing prices skyrocketed.<br><br>464<br>00:31:18,556 --> 00:31:23,016<br>The result was the biggest<br>financial bubble in history.<br><br>465<br>00:31:23,194 --> 00:31:25,628<br>Real estate is real.<br>They can see their asset.<br><br>466<br>00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:28,925<br>They can live in their asset.<br>They can rent out their asset.<br><br>467<br>00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,331<br>You had a huge boom in housing<br>that made no sense at all.<br><br>468<br>00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:39,041<br>The financing appetites<br>of the financial sector<br><br>469<br>00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:42,312<br>drove what everybody else did.<br><br>470<br>00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,348<br>Last time we had a housing bubble<br>was in the late '80s.<br><br>471<br>00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:51,615<br>In that case, the increase in home<br>price had been relatively minor.<br><br>472<br>00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,723<br>That housing bubble led<br>to a relatively severe recession.<br><br>473<br>00:31:56,894 --> 00:32:00,955<br>From 1996 until 2006,<br><br>474<br>00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:03,965<br>real home prices<br>effectively doubled.<br><br>475<br>00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:13,366<br>At $500 a ticket, they've come to<br>hear how to buy their very own piece<br><br>476<br>00:32:13,544 --> 00:32:15,738<br>of the American dream.<br><br>477<br>00:32:15,912 --> 00:32:20,076<br>Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns,<br>Lehman Brothers,<br><br>478<br>00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,048<br>Merrill Lynch were all in on this.<br><br>479<br>00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,090<br>The subprime lending alone increased<br>from 30 billion a year in funding<br><br>480<br>00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:33,195<br>to over 600 billion a year<br>in 10 years.<br><br>481<br>00:32:33,363 --> 00:32:34,887<br>They knew what was happening.<br><br>482<br>00:32:35,265 --> 00:32:38,632<br>Countrywide Financial,<br>the largest subprime lender,<br><br>483<br>00:32:38,802 --> 00:32:42,829<br>issued $97 billion worth of loans.<br><br>484<br>00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:47,568<br>It made over $ 11 billion in profits<br>as a result.<br><br>485<br>00:32:48,312 --> 00:32:51,645<br>On Wall Street,<br>annual cash bonuses spiked.<br><br>486<br>00:32:51,815 --> 00:32:53,305<br>Traders and CEOs<br><br>487<br>00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:56,179<br>became enormously wealthy<br>during the bubble.<br><br>488<br>00:32:56,353 --> 00:33:00,312<br>Lehman Brothers was a top<br>underwriter of subprime lending,<br><br>489<br>00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,720<br>and their CEO, Richard Fuld,<br><br>490<br>00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,791<br>took home $485 million.<br><br>491<br>00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:10,228<br>On Wall Street,<br>this housing and credit bubble<br><br>492<br>00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,927<br>was leading to hundreds<br>of billions of dollars of profits.<br><br>493<br>00:33:14,104 --> 00:33:17,540<br>You know, by 2006<br>about 40 percent of all profits<br><br>494<br>00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:21,804<br>of S&P 500 firms was coming<br>from financial institutions.<br><br>495<br>00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:24,139<br>It wasn't real profits or income.<br><br>496<br>00:33:24,314 --> 00:33:29,183<br>It was money created by the system<br>and booked as income.<br><br>497<br>00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:32,948<br>Two, three years down the road<br>there's a default, it's all wiped out.<br><br>498<br>00:33:33,123 --> 00:33:37,082<br>I think it was, in fact, in retrospect,<br>a great big national...<br><br>499<br>00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,922<br>And not just national,<br>global Ponzi scheme.<br><br>500<br>00:33:40,664 --> 00:33:43,531<br>Through the Home Ownership<br>and Equity Protection Act,<br><br>501<br>00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,362<br>the Federal Reserve board<br>had broad authority<br><br>502<br>00:33:46,536 --> 00:33:48,504<br>to regulate the mortgage industry.<br><br>503<br>00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:52,300<br>But Fed chairman Alan Greenspan<br>refused to use it.<br><br>504<br>00:33:52,475 --> 00:33:55,000<br>Alan Greenspan said,<br>"No, that's regulation.<br><br>505<br>00:33:55,177 --> 00:33:56,508<br>I don't believe in it."<br><br>506<br>00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:00,513<br>For 20 years, Robert Gnaizda<br>was the head of Greenlining,<br><br>507<br>00:34:00,683 --> 00:34:03,117<br>a powerful consumer<br>advocacy group.<br><br>508<br>00:34:03,285 --> 00:34:06,049<br>He met with Greenspan<br>on a regular basis.<br><br>509<br>00:34:06,222 --> 00:34:08,690<br>We gave him an example<br>of Countrywide<br><br>510<br>00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:13,921<br>and 150 different complex<br>adjustable-rate mortgages.<br><br>511<br>00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:16,929<br>He said,<br>"If you had a doctorate in math"<br><br>512<br>00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,795<br>you wouldn't be able<br>to understand them enough<br><br>513<br>00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:23,302<br>"to know which was good for you<br>and which wasn't."<br><br>514<br>00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:26,539<br>So we thought<br>he was gonna take action.<br><br>515<br>00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:28,939<br>But as the conversation continued,<br><br>516<br>00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:31,944<br>it was clear he was stuck<br>with his ideology.<br><br>517<br>00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:35,208<br>We met again<br>with Greenspan in '05.<br><br>518<br>00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:39,286<br>Often we met with him twice a year,<br>and never less than once a year.<br><br>519<br>00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:41,616<br>And he wouldn't change his mind.<br><br>520<br>00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:50,392<br>In this world<br>of global communications,<br><br>521<br>00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:52,591<br>the efficient movement<br>of capital<br><br>522<br>00:34:52,768 --> 00:34:56,465<br>is helping to create the greatest<br>prosperity in human history.<br><br>523<br>00:35:02,845 --> 00:35:06,713<br>A hundred and forty-six people were cut<br>from the SEC Enforcement Division?<br><br>524<br>00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:08,816<br>Is that what you also testified to?<br><br>525<br>00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:10,281<br>Yes.<br><br>526<br>00:35:10,453 --> 00:35:15,789<br>Yeah, I think there has been<br>a systematic gutting,<br><br>527<br>00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:18,552<br>or whatever you wanna call it,<br>of the agency<br><br>528<br>00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:21,821<br>and it's capability<br>through cutting back of staff.<br><br>529<br>00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:24,726<br>The SEC Office<br>of Risk Management<br><br>530<br>00:35:24,899 --> 00:35:28,858<br>was reduced to a staff,<br>did you say, of one?<br><br>531<br>00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:33,167<br>Yeah. When that gentleman would<br>go home, he could turn the lights out.<br><br>532<br>00:35:35,143 --> 00:35:38,340<br>During the bubble, investment<br>banks were borrowing heavily<br><br>533<br>00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:42,313<br>to buy more loans<br>and create more CDOs.<br><br>534<br>00:35:43,117 --> 00:35:46,245<br>The ratio between borrowed money<br>and the banks' own money<br><br>535<br>00:35:46,421 --> 00:35:48,286<br>was called leverage.<br><br>536<br>00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:52,620<br>The more the banks borrowed,<br>the higher their leverage.<br><br>537<br>00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:58,356<br>In 2004, Henry Paulson,<br>the CEO of Goldman Sachs,<br><br>538<br>00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:02,799<br>helped lobby the SEC<br>to relax limits on leverage,<br><br>539<br>00:36:03,238 --> 00:36:07,072<br>allowing the banks<br>to sharply increase their borrowing.<br><br>540<br>00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:09,767<br>The SEC somehow decided<br><br>541<br>00:36:09,944 --> 00:36:13,311<br>to let investment banks<br>gamble a lot more.<br><br>542<br>00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:16,609<br>That was nuts. I don't know why<br>they did that, but they did.<br><br>543<br>00:36:23,324 --> 00:36:26,724<br>We've said these<br>are the big guys, and clearly that's true.<br><br>544<br>00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:32,394<br>But that means if anything goes wrong,<br>it's going to be an awfully big mess.<br><br>545<br>00:36:33,535 --> 00:36:36,305<br>You are<br>dealing with the most<br><br>546<br>00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:39,098<br>highly sophisticated<br>financial institutions.<br><br>547<br>00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:43,074<br>These are the firms that do<br>most of the derivative activity.<br><br>548<br>00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:46,680<br>We talked to some<br>as to what their comfort level was.<br><br>549<br>00:36:46,848 --> 00:36:51,842<br>The firms actually thought<br>that the number was appropriate.<br><br>550<br>00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,320<br>The commissioners vote to<br>adopt the new rules as recommended.<br><br>551<br>00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:57,684<br>- Yes.<br>- Yes.<br><br>552<br>00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:01,862<br>We do indeed. It's unanimous.<br>And we are adjourned.<br><br>553<br>00:37:04,698 --> 00:37:07,929<br>The degree of leverage<br>in the financial system<br><br>554<br>00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,626<br>became absolutely frightening.<br><br>555<br>00:37:10,804 --> 00:37:15,264<br>Investment banks leveraging<br>up to the level of 33-to-1.<br><br>556<br>00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:18,138<br>Which means that<br>a tiny 3-percent decrease<br><br>557<br>00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:21,645<br>in the value of their asset base<br>would leave them insolvent.<br><br>558<br>00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:27,216<br>There was another ticking<br>time bomb in the financial system.<br><br>559<br>00:37:27,387 --> 00:37:30,652<br>AIG, the world's largest<br>insurance company,<br><br>560<br>00:37:30,824 --> 00:37:33,315<br>was selling huge quantities<br>of derivatives<br><br>561<br>00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:35,324<br>called credit default swaps.<br><br>562<br>00:37:37,264 --> 00:37:39,459<br>For investors who owned CDOs,<br><br>563<br>00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:43,160<br>credit default swaps worked<br>like an insurance policy.<br><br>564<br>00:37:43,337 --> 00:37:45,965<br>An investor who purchased<br>a credit default swap<br><br>565<br>00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:49,131<br>paid AIG a quarterly premium.<br><br>566<br>00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,072<br>If the CDO went bad,<br><br>567<br>00:37:51,244 --> 00:37:55,374<br>AIG promised to pay the investor<br>for their losses.<br><br>568<br>00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:58,350<br>But unlike regular insurance,<br><br>569<br>00:37:58,518 --> 00:38:02,113<br>speculators could also buy<br>credit default swaps from AIG<br><br>570<br>00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:05,884<br>in order to bet against CDOs<br>they didn't own.<br><br>571<br>00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,454<br>In insurance, you can only<br>insure something you own.<br><br>572<br>00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,690<br>Let's say you and I own property.<br>I own a house.<br><br>573<br>00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:15,232<br>I can only insure that house once.<br><br>574<br>00:38:15,402 --> 00:38:18,337<br>The derivatives universe<br>essentially enables anybody<br><br>575<br>00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,473<br>to actually insure that house.<br><br>576<br>00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:22,973<br>You could insure that,<br>somebody else could.<br><br>577<br>00:38:23,143 --> 00:38:25,202<br>So 50 people might insure<br>my house.<br><br>578<br>00:38:25,379 --> 00:38:28,109<br>So what happens is,<br>if my house burns down,<br><br>579<br>00:38:28,281 --> 00:38:32,114<br>the number of losses in the system<br>becomes proportionately larger.<br><br>580<br>00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,449<br>Since credit default swaps<br>were unregulated,<br><br>581<br>00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:39,955<br>AIG didn't have to put aside<br>any money to cover potential losses.<br><br>582<br>00:38:40,126 --> 00:38:44,187<br>Instead, AIG paid it's employees<br>huge cash bonuses<br><br>583<br>00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,729<br>as soon as contracts<br>were signed.<br><br>584<br>00:38:46,899 --> 00:38:49,367<br>But if the CDOs later went bad,<br><br>585<br>00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,163<br>AIG would be on the hook.<br><br>586<br>00:38:52,338 --> 00:38:56,502<br>People were essentially being<br>rewarded for taking massive risks.<br><br>587<br>00:38:56,676 --> 00:39:00,510<br>In good times, they generate<br>short-term revenues and profits<br><br>588<br>00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,113<br>and, therefore, bonuses.<br><br>589<br>00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:05,648<br>But that's gonna lead to the firm<br>to be bankrupt over time.<br><br>590<br>00:39:05,818 --> 00:39:08,309<br>That's a distorted system<br>of compensation.<br><br>591<br>00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:12,081<br>AIG's Financial Products division<br>in London<br><br>592<br>00:39:12,258 --> 00:39:16,627<br>issued $500 billion worth of credit<br>default swaps during the bubble,<br><br>593<br>00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:21,789<br>many of them for CDOs<br>backed by subprime mortgages.<br><br>594<br>00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:24,401<br>The 400 employees at AIGFP<br><br>595<br>00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,597<br>made $3.5 billion<br>between 2000 and 2007.<br><br>596<br>00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:32,105<br>Joseph Cassano,<br>the head of AIGFP,<br><br>597<br>00:39:32,278 --> 00:39:35,475<br>personally made $315 million.<br><br>598<br>00:39:35,648 --> 00:39:37,209<br>It's hard for us,<br><br>599<br>00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:41,880<br>and without being flippant,<br>to even see a scenario<br><br>600<br>00:39:42,054 --> 00:39:44,352<br>within any kind of realm of reason<br><br>601<br>00:39:44,523 --> 00:39:49,426<br>that would see us losing one dollar<br>in any of those transactions.<br><br>602<br>00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:53,926<br>In 2007, AIG's<br>auditors raised warnings.<br><br>603<br>00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,193<br>One of them, Joseph St. Denis,<br><br>604<br>00:39:56,368 --> 00:39:59,997<br>resigned in protest after<br>Cassano repeatedly blocked him<br><br>605<br>00:40:00,172 --> 00:40:03,107<br>from investigating<br>AIGFP's accounting.<br><br>606<br>00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,231<br>Let me tell you one<br>person that didn't get a<br><br>607<br>00:40:05,244 --> 00:40:07,210<br>bonus while everybody<br>else was getting bonuses.<br><br>608<br>00:40:07,378 --> 00:40:11,371<br>That was St. Denis. Mr. St. Denis<br>tried to alert the two of you<br><br>609<br>00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:14,211<br>to the fact you were running<br>into big problems.<br><br>610<br>00:40:14,753 --> 00:40:18,018<br>He quit in frustration,<br>and he didn't get a bonus.<br><br>611<br>00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:21,153<br>In 2005, Raghuram Rajan,<br><br>612<br>00:40:21,326 --> 00:40:24,818<br>then the chief economist<br>of the International Monetary Fund,<br><br>613<br>00:40:24,996 --> 00:40:27,624<br>delivered a paper<br>at the Jackson Hole symposium,<br><br>614<br>00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:30,461<br>the most elite banking conference<br>in the world.<br><br>615<br>00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:32,125<br>Who was in the audience?<br><br>616<br>00:40:32,303 --> 00:40:37,138<br>It was the central bankers<br>of the world,<br><br>617<br>00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:40,675<br>ranging from<br>Mr. Greenspan himself,<br><br>618<br>00:40:40,845 --> 00:40:42,039<br>Ben Bernanke<br><br>619<br>00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:43,339<br>Larry Summers.<br><br>620<br>00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:45,480<br>Tim Geithner was there.<br><br>621<br>00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,618<br>The title of the paper<br>was essentially:<br><br>622<br>00:40:47,919 --> 00:40:51,514<br>"Is Financial Development<br>Making the World Riskier?"<br><br>623<br>00:40:51,689 --> 00:40:55,056<br>And the conclusion was, it is.<br><br>624<br>00:40:57,095 --> 00:40:59,825<br>Rajan's paper focused<br>on incentive structures<br><br>625<br>00:40:59,998 --> 00:41:04,230<br>that generated huge cash bonuses<br>based on short-term profits,<br><br>626<br>00:41:04,402 --> 00:41:07,667<br>but which imposed no penalties<br>for later losses.<br><br>627<br>00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,774<br>Rajan argued that these incentives<br>encouraged bankers<br><br>628<br>00:41:10,942 --> 00:41:14,537<br>to take risks that might eventually<br>destroy their own firms<br><br>629<br>00:41:14,712 --> 00:41:17,943<br>or even the entire<br>financial system.<br><br>630<br>00:41:20,518 --> 00:41:24,750<br>It's very easy to generate<br>performance by taking on more risk.<br><br>631<br>00:41:24,923 --> 00:41:29,451<br>So what you need to do is compensate<br>for risk-adjusted performance.<br><br>632<br>00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:31,891<br>And that's where<br>all the bodies are buried.<br><br>633<br>00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:35,191<br>Rajan, you know,<br>hit the nail on the head.<br><br>634<br>00:41:35,366 --> 00:41:37,357<br>What he particularly said was:<br><br>635<br>00:41:37,535 --> 00:41:39,935<br>"You guys have claimed<br>you've found a way"<br><br>636<br>00:41:40,103 --> 00:41:42,571<br>to make more profits<br>with less risk.<br><br>637<br>00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:45,936<br>I say you've found a way<br>to make more profits with more risk.<br><br>638<br>00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:47,474<br>"There's a big difference."<br><br>639<br>00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:50,238<br>Summers was vocal.<br><br>640<br>00:41:50,581 --> 00:41:52,776<br>He basically thought<br><br>641<br>00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:58,217<br>that I was criticizing the change<br>in the financial world<br><br>642<br>00:41:58,388 --> 00:42:01,687<br>and was worried about,<br>you know, regulation,<br><br>643<br>00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:03,884<br>which would reverse<br>this change.<br><br>644<br>00:42:04,061 --> 00:42:06,461<br>Essentially he accused me<br>of being a Luddite.<br><br>645<br>00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:11,092<br>He wanted to make sure<br>that we didn't bring in<br><br>646<br>00:42:11,268 --> 00:42:13,065<br>a whole new set of regulations<br><br>647<br>00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:15,728<br>to constrain the financial sector.<br><br>648<br>00:42:19,843 --> 00:42:23,973<br>You're gonna make an extra $2 million<br>a year, or $ 10 million a year,<br><br>649<br>00:42:24,147 --> 00:42:26,741<br>for putting your financial institution<br>at risk.<br><br>650<br>00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:29,044<br>Someone else pays the bill,<br>you don't.<br><br>651<br>00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:30,652<br>Would you make that bet?<br><br>652<br>00:42:30,821 --> 00:42:34,132<br>Most people on Wall Street said,<br>"Sure, I'd make that bet."<br><br>653<br>00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,890<br>It never was enough.<br><br>654<br>00:43:19,068 --> 00:43:22,333<br>They don't wanna own one home,<br>they wanna own five homes.<br><br>655<br>00:43:22,505 --> 00:43:25,303<br>And they wanna have<br>an expensive penthouse<br><br>656<br>00:43:25,474 --> 00:43:27,601<br>on Park Avenue.<br><br>657<br>00:43:28,177 --> 00:43:31,044<br>And they wanna have<br>their own private jet.<br><br>658<br>00:43:31,213 --> 00:43:34,080<br>You think this<br>is an industry where high...?<br><br>659<br>00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,480<br>Very high compensation levels<br>are justified?<br><br>660<br>00:43:36,652 --> 00:43:39,348<br>I think I would take caution,<br>or take heed,<br><br>661<br>00:43:39,522 --> 00:43:42,719<br>or take exception to your word<br>"very high."

trading floor.<br><br>666<br>00:43:54,904 --> 00:43:57,202<br>There were art advisors there<br>all the time.<br><br>667<br>00:43:57,373 --> 00:43:58,965<br>He had a private elevator.<br><br>668<br>00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:01,701<br>He wanted to be disconnected.<br><br>669<br>00:44:01,877 --> 00:44:04,710<br>His elevator,<br>they hired technicians to program it<br><br>670<br>00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,644<br>so that his driver would call in<br>in the morning<br><br>671<br>00:44:07,817 --> 00:44:09,944<br>and a security guard<br>would hold it.<br><br>672<br>00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:14,579<br>There's only a three-second window<br>where he actually has to see people.<br><br>673<br>00:44:14,757 --> 00:44:17,783<br>And he hops into this elevator<br>and it goes straight to 31.<br><br>674<br>00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,258<br>Lehman owned corporate jets.<br><br>675<br>00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:22,454<br>You know about this?<br>Yes.<br><br>676<br>00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:23,941<br>How many were there?<br><br>677<br>00:44:23,966 --> 00:44:26,628<br>Well, there were<br>six, including the 767 s.<br><br>678<br>00:44:26,902 --> 00:44:28,563<br>They also had a helicopter.<br><br>679<br>00:44:28,738 --> 00:44:31,229<br>Isn't that kind<br>of a lot of planes to have?<br><br>680<br>00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,078<br>We're dealing with<br>type-A personalities.<br><br>681<br>00:44:36,278 --> 00:44:38,508<br>And type-A personalities know<br>everything in the world.<br><br>682<br>00:44:38,681 --> 00:44:41,013<br>Banking became a pissing contest.<br><br>683<br>00:44:41,183 --> 00:44:43,447<br>"Mine's bigger than yours."<br>That kind of stuff.<br><br>684<br>00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,780<br>It was all men that ran it,<br>incidentally.<br><br>685<br>00:44:45,955 --> 00:44:49,947<br>Fifty-billion-dollar deals weren't large<br>enough, so we'd do 100-billion deals.<br><br>686<br>00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:52,958<br>These people are risk-takers.<br>They're impulsive.<br><br>687<br>00:44:58,433 --> 00:45:01,561<br>It's part of their behavior.<br>It's part of their personality.<br><br>688<br>00:45:01,736 --> 00:45:04,796<br>And that manifests<br>outside of work as well.<br><br>689<br>00:45:04,973 --> 00:45:07,498<br>It was quite typical<br>for the guys to go out<br><br>690<br>00:45:07,675 --> 00:45:09,666<br>to go to strip bars, to use drugs.<br><br>691<br>00:45:09,844 --> 00:45:12,642<br>I see a lot of cocaine use,<br>use of prostitution.<br><br>692<br>00:45:19,754 --> 00:45:22,086<br>Recently, neuroscientists<br>have done experiments<br><br>693<br>00:45:22,257 --> 00:45:27,217<br>where they've taken individuals<br>and put them into an MRI machine,<br><br>694<br>00:45:27,395 --> 00:45:31,661<br>and they have them play a game<br>where the prize is money.<br><br>695<br>00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:35,428<br>And they noticed that when<br>the subjects earn money,<br><br>696<br>00:45:35,603 --> 00:45:37,901<br>the part of the brain<br>that gets stimulated<br><br>697<br>00:45:38,073 --> 00:45:40,439<br>is the same part<br>that cocaine stimulates.<br><br>698<br>00:45:40,608 --> 00:45:44,271<br>A lot of people feel that they<br>need to participate in that behavior<br><br>699<br>00:45:44,446 --> 00:45:46,880<br>to make it, to get promoted,<br>get recognized.<br><br>700<br>00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:50,108<br>According to a Bloomberg<br>article, business entertainment<br><br>701<br>00:45:50,285 --> 00:45:53,618<br>represents 5 percent of revenue<br>for derivatives brokers<br><br>702<br>00:45:53,788 --> 00:45:58,122<br>and often includes strip clubs,<br>prostitution and drugs.<br><br>703<br>00:45:58,293 --> 00:46:01,956<br>A New York broker filed a lawsuit<br>in 2007 against his firm<br><br>704<br>00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:07,331<br>alleging he was required to retain<br>prostitutes to entertain traders.<br><br>705<br>00:46:07,502 --> 00:46:09,367<br>There's just a blatant disregard<br><br>706<br>00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:14,201<br>for the impact that their actions<br>might have on society, on family.<br><br>707<br>00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:17,606<br>They have no problem<br>using a prostitute<br><br>708<br>00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:20,009<br>and going home to their wife.<br><br>709<br>00:46:29,022 --> 00:46:30,922<br>How many customers?<br><br>710<br>00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:33,389<br>About 10,000<br>at that point in time.<br><br>711<br>00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:39,692<br>What fraction<br>were from Wall Street?<br><br>712<br>00:46:39,867 --> 00:46:44,327<br>Of the higher-end clients,<br>probably 40 to 50 percent.<br><br>713<br>00:46:44,505 --> 00:46:46,945<br>Were all the major<br>Wall Street firms represented?<br><br>714<br>00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:48,131<br>Goldman Sachs?<br><br>715<br>00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:51,243<br>Lehman Brothers.<br>They're all in there.<br><br>716<br>00:46:51,411 --> 00:46:55,211<br>Morgan Stanley was<br>a little less of that.<br><br>717<br>00:46:55,382 --> 00:46:58,408<br>I think Goldman was<br>pretty, pretty big with that.<br><br>718<br>00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:00,152<br>Clients would call and say:<br><br>719<br>00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,084<br>"Can you get me a Lamborghini<br>for the girl?"<br><br>720<br>00:47:03,257 --> 00:47:05,555<br>These guys were spending<br>corporate money.<br><br>721<br>00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:10,095<br>I had many black cards from,<br>you know, the various financial firms.<br><br>722<br>00:47:10,597 --> 00:47:13,998<br>What's happening is<br>services are being charged<br><br>723<br>00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:15,931<br>to computer repair.<br><br>724<br>00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:20,434<br>Trading research, you know,<br>consulting for market compliance.<br><br>725<br>00:47:20,607 --> 00:47:23,872<br>Just gave them letterhead and said,<br>"Make your own invoice."<br><br>726<br>00:47:24,044 --> 00:47:27,207<br>This behavior extends to<br>the senior management of the firm?<br><br>727<br>00:47:27,381 --> 00:47:29,008<br>Absolutely does. Yeah.<br><br>728<br>00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:31,276<br>I know for a fact that it does.<br><br>729<br>00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:34,215<br>It extends to the very top.<br><br>730<br>00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:41,855<br>A friend of mine in a company that<br>has a big financial presence said:<br><br>731<br>00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:45,988<br>"It's about time you learned<br>about subprime mortgages."<br><br>732<br>00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:49,932<br>So he set up a session<br>with his trading desk and me.<br><br>733<br>00:47:50,337 --> 00:47:53,966<br>And the techie who did all this<br>gets very excited,<br><br>734<br>00:47:54,141 --> 00:47:57,632<br>runs to his computer,<br>pulls up in about three seconds<br><br>735<br>00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,836<br>this Goldman Sachs<br>issue of securities.<br><br>736<br>00:48:01,013 --> 00:48:02,446<br>It was a complete disaster.<br><br>737<br>00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:08,185<br>Borrowers had borrowed, on average,<br>99.3 percent of the price of the house.<br><br>738<br>00:48:08,354 --> 00:48:10,254<br>They have no money<br>in the house.<br><br>739<br>00:48:10,423 --> 00:48:13,654<br>If anything goes wrong,<br>they walk away from the mortgage.<br><br>740<br>00:48:13,826 --> 00:48:16,590<br>This is not a loan<br>you'd really make, right?<br><br>741<br>00:48:16,762 --> 00:48:18,195<br>You've gotta be crazy.<br><br>742<br>00:48:18,364 --> 00:48:21,492<br>But somehow,<br>you took 8000 of these loans,<br><br>743<br>00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:23,862<br>and by the time<br>the guys were done<br><br>744<br>00:48:24,036 --> 00:48:26,834<br>at Goldman Sachs<br>and the rating agencies,<br><br>745<br>00:48:27,006 --> 00:48:29,440<br>two-thirds of the loans<br>were rated triple-A.<br><br>746<br>00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:32,476<br>They were rated as safe<br>as government securities.<br><br>747<br>00:48:32,645 --> 00:48:34,169<br>It's utterly mad.<br><br>748<br>00:48:35,047 --> 00:48:38,608<br>Goldman Sachs sold at least $3.<br>1 billion worth<br><br>749<br>00:48:38,784 --> 00:48:42,550<br>of these toxic CDOs<br>in the first half of 2006.<br><br>750<br>00:48:42,955 --> 00:48:46,891<br>The CEO of Goldman Sachs<br>at this time was Henry Paulson,<br><br>751<br>00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:49,550<br>the highest paid CEO<br>on Wall Street.<br><br>752<br>00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:54,461<br>Good morning.<br>I'm pleased to announce<br><br>753<br>00:48:54,634 --> 00:48:58,502<br>that I will nominate Henry Paulson<br>to be the Secretary of the Treasury.<br><br>754<br>00:48:58,671 --> 00:49:00,400<br>He has a lifetime of experience.<br><br>755<br>00:49:00,573 --> 00:49:02,734<br>He has knowledge<br>of financial markets.<br><br>756<br>00:49:02,908 --> 00:49:05,809<br>He's earned a reputation<br>for candor and integrity.<br><br>757<br>00:49:06,312 --> 00:49:08,177<br>You might think it would be

secretary<br><br>760<br>00:49:13,486 --> 00:49:16,478<br>was the best<br>financial decision of his life.<br><br>761<br>00:49:16,656 --> 00:49:20,990<br>Paulson had to sell his $485 million<br>of Goldman stock<br><br>762<br>00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,321<br>when he went to work<br>for the government.<br><br>763<br>00:49:23,496 --> 00:49:26,522<br>But because of a law passed<br>by the first President Bush,<br><br>764<br>00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:28,860<br>he didn't have to pay<br>any taxes on it.<br><br>765<br>00:49:29,035 --> 00:49:32,060<br>It saved him $50 million.<br><br>766<br>00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:42,472<br>The article came<br>out in October of 2007.<br><br>767<br>00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:46,341<br>Already, a third of<br>the mortgages

securities<br><br>770<br>00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:58,084<br>was the Public Employees'<br>Retirement System of Mississippi,<br><br>771<br>00:49:58,263 --> 00:50:01,790<br>which provides monthly benefits<br>to over 80,000 retirees.<br><br>772<br>00:50:02,734 --> 00:50:07,535<br>They lost millions of dollars<br>and are now suing Goldman Sachs.<br><br>773<br>00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:25,853<br>By late 2006, Goldman had<br>taken things a step further.<br><br>774<br>00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:28,515<br>It didn't just sell toxic CDOs,<br><br>775<br>00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:32,857<br>it started betting against them at the<br>same time it was telling customers<br><br>776<br>00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:35,761<br>that they were<br>high-quality investments.<br><br>777<br>00:50:36,668 --> 00:50:39,933<br>By purchasing credit default swaps<br>from AIG,<br><br>778<br>00:50:40,105 --> 00:50:43,074<br>Goldman could bet against<br>CDOs it didn't own<br><br>779<br>00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:46,472<br>and get paid<br>when the CDOs failed.<br><br>780<br>00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:51,643<br>I asked if anybody<br>called the customers and said:<br><br>781<br>00:50:51,816 --> 00:50:54,614<br>"We don't really like this kind<br>of mortgage anymore,<br><br>782<br>00:50:54,786 --> 00:50:56,947<br>and we thought<br>you ought to know."<br><br>783<br>00:50:57,122 --> 00:51:01,650<br>They didn't say anything, but you could<br>feel the laughter over the phone.<br><br>784<br>00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:05,793<br>Goldman Sachs bought<br>at least $22 billion<br><br>785<br>00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:08,557<br>of credit default swaps from AIG.<br><br>786<br>00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:13,635<br>It was so much that Goldman realized<br>that AIG itself might go bankrupt.<br><br>787<br>00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,773<br>So they spent $ 150 million<br>insuring themselves<br><br>788<br>00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,738<br>against AIG's potential collapse.<br><br>789<br>00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,505<br>Then in 2007,<br>Goldman went even further.<br><br>790<br>00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,376<br>They started selling CDOs<br>specifically designed<br><br>791<br>00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,075<br>so that the more money<br>their customers lost,<br><br>792<br>00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,655<br>the more money<br>Goldman Sachs made.<br><br>793<br>00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:43,089<br>Six hundred million dollars of<br>Timberwolf securities is

Lehman.<br><br>1056<br>01:07:08,448 --> 01:07:09,972<br>But Lehman wasn't alone.<br><br>1057<br>01:07:10,383 --> 01:07:15,184<br>Merrill Lynch was also<br>on the brink of

buying<br>Lehman was the British firm Barclays.<br><br>1060<br>01:07:24,564 --> 01:07:28,432<br>But British regulators demanded<br>a financial guarantee from the U.S.<br><br>1061<br>01:07:28,968 --> 01:07:30,993<br>Paulson refused.<br><br>1062<br>01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:40,808<br>We got in a cab and went<br>to the Federal Reserve Bank.<br><br>1063<br>01:07:42,548 --> 01:07:45,847<br>They wanted

a terrible event,<br><br>1066<br>01:07:54,627 --> 01:07:57,221<br>and at some point<br>I used the word Armageddon,<br><br>1067<br>01:07:57,397 --> 01:08:02,027<br>and they consider the consequences<br>of what they were proposing.<br><br>1068<br>01:08:02,201 --> 01:08:04,726<br>The effect on the market<br>would be extraordinary.<br><br>1069<br>01:08:04,904 --> 01:08:06,701<br>You

still of the belief<br>that in order to calm the markets<br><br>1072<br>01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:21,481<br>and move forward, it was necessary<br>for Lehman to go into bankruptcy.<br><br>1073<br>01:08:21,654 --> 01:08:23,094<br>"Calm the markets"?<br>Yes.<br><br>1074<br>01:08:23,422 --> 01:08:27,791<br>When were you first told that<br>Lehman, in fact, was going to

01:16:20,186<br>We won the lottery.<br><br>1196<br>01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:23,261<br>But the reality was when<br>the first payment arrived.<br><br>1197<br>01:16:28,034 --> 01:16:32,733<br>I felt very bad<br>for my husband<br><br>1198<br>01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:40,143<br>because he works too much.<br>And we have three children.<br><br>1199<br>01:16:49,656 --> 01:16:53,490<br>The majority I've seen are<br>people hurt by the economy.<br><br>1200<br>01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:56,652<br>They were living day to day,<br>paycheck to paycheck,<br><br>1201<br>01:16:56,829 --> 01:16:58,057<br>and that ran

people.<br><br>1501<br>01:34:42,984 --> 01:34:46,977<br>American factory workers were laid<br>off by the tens of thousands.<br><br>1502<br>01:34:47,154 --> 01:34:49,782<br>Our manufacturing base<br>was destroyed, literally,<br><br>1503<br>01:34:49,957 --> 01:34:51,254<br>over a few years.<br><br>1504<br>01:34:51,425 --> 01:34:55,725<br>As manufacturing declined,<br>other industries rose.<br><br>1505<br>01:34:55,896 --> 01:34:59,127<br>The United States leads the world<br>in information technology,<br><br>1506<br>01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:02,360<br>where high-paying jobs<br>are easy to find.<br><br>1507<br>01:35:02,536 --> 01:35:04,697<br>But those jobs<br>require an education.<br><br>1508<br>01:35:05,006 --> 01:35:09,874<br>And for average Americans,<br>college is increasingly out of reach.<br><br>1509<br>01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:15,341<br>While universities like Harvard have<br>billions of dollars in endowments,<br><br>1510<br>01:35:15,515 --> 01:35:19,815<br>funding for public universities<br>is shrinking and tuition is rising.<br><br>1511<br>01:35:20,787 --> 01:35:23,255<br>Tuition for California's<br>public universities<br><br>1512<br>01:35:23,423 --> 01:35:29,760<br>rose from $650 in the 1970s<br>to over $ 10,000 in 2010.<br><br>1513<br>01:35:30,797 --> 01:35:35,063<br>The most important determinant<br>of whether Americans go to college<br><br>1514<br>01:35:35,235 --> 01:35:38,227<br>is whether they can find<br>the money to pay for it.<br><br>1515<br>01:35:38,505 --> 01:35:43,465<br>Meanwhile, American tax policy<br>shifted to favor the wealthy.<br><br>1516<br>01:35:43,643 --> 01:35:48,842<br>When I first came to office, I thought<br>taxes were too high, and they were.<br><br>1517<br>01:35:49,015 --> 01:35:51,813<br>The most dramatic change<br>was a series of tax cuts<br><br>1518<br>01:35:51,985 --> 01:35:54,613<br>designed by Glenn Hubbard,<br>who was serving<br><br>1519<br>01:35:54,788 --> 01:35:58,087<br>as President Bush's<br>chief economic advisor.<br><br>1520<br>01:35:58,825 --> 01:36:02,454<br>The Bush administration sharply<br>reduced taxes on investment gains,<br><br>1521<br>01:36:02,629 --> 01:36:05,621<br>stock dividends,<br>and eliminated the estate tax.<br><br>1522<br>01:36:05,799 --> 01:36:08,927<br>We had a comprehensive plan<br>that when acted<br><br>1523<br>01:36:09,102 --> 01:36:12,868<br>has left nearly $ 1.1 trillion<br>in the hands of American workers,<br><br>1524<br>01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:15,633<br>families, investors<br>and small-business owners.<br><br>1525<br>01:36:15,809 --> 01:36:21,611<br>Most benefits of these cuts went to the<br>wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.<br><br>1526<br>01:36:22,148 --> 01:36:24,412<br>And by the way,<br>it was the cornerstone<br><br>1527<br>01:36:24,584 --> 01:36:26,950<br>in many ways,<br>of our economic recovery policy.<br><br>1528<br>01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:29,945<br>Inequality of wealth<br>in the United States<br><br>1529<br>01:36:30,123 --> 01:36:33,524<br>is now higher<br>than in any other developed country.<br><br>1530<br>01:36:34,127 --> 01:36:36,891<br>American families responded<br>to these changes in two ways:<br><br>1531<br>01:36:38,331 --> 01:36:42,892<br>By working longer hours<br>and by going into debt.<br><br>1532<br>01:36:43,068 --> 01:36:46,663<br>As the middle class falls<br>further and further behind,<br><br>1533<br>01:36:46,839 --> 01:36:50,707<br>there is a political urge<br>to respond<br><br>1534<br>01:36:50,876 --> 01:36:54,209<br>by making it easier to get credit.<br><br>1535<br>01:36:54,379 --> 01:36:56,870<br>You don't have to have<br>a lousy home.<br><br>1536<br>01:36:57,049 --> 01:37:02,646<br>The low-income home buyer can have<br>just as nice a house as anybody else.<br><br>1537<br>01:37:03,188 --> 01:37:07,591<br>American families borrowed<br>to finance their homes, their cars,<br><br>1538<br>01:37:07,759 --> 01:37:11,525<br>their healthcare,<br>and their children's educations.<br><br>1539<br>01:37:11,897 --> 01:37:14,559<br>People in the bottom 90 percent<br><br>1540<br>01:37:15,033 --> 01:37:19,595<br>lost ground<br>between 1980 and 2007.<br><br>1541<br>01:37:19,771 --> 01:37:24,504<br>It all went to the top 1 percent.<br><br>1542<br>01:37:26,478 --> 01:37:29,379<br>For the first time in history,<br>average Americans<br><br>1543<br>01:37:29,548 --> 01:37:34,315<br>have less education and are less<br>prosperous than their parents.<br><br>1544<br>01:37:36,488 --> 01:37:39,719<br>The era of greed and irresponsibility<br><br>1545<br>01:37:39,892 --> 01:37:43,191<br>on Wall Street and in Washington<br><br>1546<br>01:37:43,362 --> 01:37:45,421<br>has led us to a financial crisis<br><br>1547<br>01:37:45,597 --> 01:37:49,294<br>as serious as any that we've faced<br>since the Great Depression.<br><br>1548<br>01:37:49,468 --> 01:37:52,733<br>When the financial crisis<br>struck before the 2008 election,<br><br>1549<br>01:37:53,172 --> 01:37:55,436<br>Barack Obama pointed<br>to Wall Street greed<br><br>1550<br>01:37:55,607 --> 01:37:59,907<br>and regulatory failures as examples<br>of the need for change in America.<br><br>1551<br>01:38:00,078 --> 01:38:02,774<br>A lack of oversight in Washington<br>and on Wall Street<br><br>1552<br>01:38:02,948 --> 01:38:05,940<br>is exactly what got us<br>into this mess.<br><br>1553<br>01:38:06,552 --> 01:38:10,852<br>After taking office, Obama spoke<br>of the need to reform the industry.<br><br>1554<br>01:38:11,023 --> 01:38:14,321<br>We want a risk regulator,<br>increased capital requirements.<br><br>1555<br>01:38:14,492 --> 01:38:17,120<br>We need a consumer financial<br>protection agency.<br><br>1556<br>01:38:17,295 --> 01:38:19,126<br>We need to change<br>Wall Street's culture.<br><br>1557<br>01:38:19,764 --> 01:38:22,699<br>But when finally enacted<br>in mid-2010,<br><br>1558<br>01:38:22,867 --> 01:38:25,631<br>the administration's<br>financial reforms were weak.<br><br>1559<br>01:38:25,803 --> 01:38:29,239<br>And in some critical areas,<br>including the rating agencies,<br><br>1560<br>01:38:29,407 --> 01:38:31,671<br>lobbying and compensation,<br><br>1561<br>01:38:31,842 --> 01:38:34,811<br>nothing significant<br>was even proposed.<br><br>1562<br>01:38:34,979 --> 01:38:38,471<br>Addressing Obama and,<br>quote, "regulatory reform,"<br><br>1563<br>01:38:38,649 --> 01:38:42,847<br>my response, if it was<br>one word, would be "ha."<br><br>1564<br>01:38:43,654 --> 01:38:46,088<br>There's very little reform.<br><br>1565<br>01:38:46,257 --> 01:38:47,815<br>How come?<br><br>1566<br>01:38:48,926 --> 01:38:51,087<br>It's a Wall Street government.<br><br>1567<br>01:38:53,564 --> 01:38:57,091<br>Obama chose Timothy<br>Geithner as Treasury secretary.<br><br>1568<br>01:38:57,268 --> 01:39:00,032<br>Geithner was president<br>of the New York Federal Reserve<br><br>1569<br>01:39:00,204 --> 01:39:03,071<br>during the crisis,<br>and a key player in the decision<br><br>1570<br>01:39:03,241 --> 01:39:05,835<br>to pay Goldman Sachs<br>100 cents on the dollar<br><br>1571<br>01:39:06,010 --> 01:39:07,910<br>for it's bets against mortgages.<br><br>1572<br>01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:11,071<br>When Tim Geithner<br>was testifying<br><br>1573<br>01:39:11,249 --> 01:39:13,479<br>to be confirmed<br>as Treasury secretary<br><br>1574<br>01:39:13,651 --> 01:39:16,711<br>he said,<br>"I have never been a regulator."<br><br>1575<br>01:39:16,887 --> 01:39:19,481<br>That said to me<br>he did not understand his job<br><br>1576<br>01:39:19,657 --> 01:39:21,352<br>as President of the New York Fed.<br><br>1577<br>01:39:25,696 --> 01:39:28,893<br>The new President of the<br>New York Fed is William C. Dudley,<br><br>1578<br>01:39:29,066 --> 01:39:31,591<br>the former chief economist<br>of Goldman Sachs<br><br>1579<br>01:39:31,769 --> 01:39:34,932<br>whose paper with Glenn Hubbard<br>praised derivatives.<br><br>1580<br>01:39:35,106 --> 01:39:37,506<br>Geithner's chief of staff<br>is Mark Patterson,<br><br>1581<br>01:39:37,675 --> 01:39:39,734<br>a former lobbyist for Goldman.<br><br>1582<br>01:39:39,910 --> 01:39:42,435<br>And one of the senior advisors<br>is Lewis Sachs,<br><br>1583<br>01:39:42,613 --> 01:39:45,741<br>who oversaw Tricadia,<br>a company heavily involved<br><br>1584<br>01:39:45,916 --> 01:39:49,544<br>in betting against the mortgage<br>securities it was selling.<br><br>1585<br>01:39:49,886 --> 01:39:52,548<br>To head the Commodity Futures<br>Trading Commission,<br><br>1586<br>01:39:52,722 --> 01:39:56,488<br>Obama picked Gary Gensler,<br>a former Goldman Sachs executive<br><br>1587<br>01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:59,595<br>who had helped ban<br>the regulation of derivatives.<br><br>1588<br>01:39:59,763 --> 01:40:02,061<br>To run the Securities<br>and Exchange Commission,<br><br>1589<br>01:40:02,232 --> 01:40:06,168<br>Obama picked Mary Schapiro,<br>the former CEO of FINRA,<br><br>1590<br>01:40:06,336 --> 01:40:09,999<br>the investment banking industry's<br>self-regulation body.<br><br>1591<br>01:40:10,173 --> 01:40:12,539<br>Obama's chief of staff,<br>Rahm Emanuel,<br><br>1592<br>01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:17,271<br>made $320,000 serving<br>on the board of Freddie Mac.<br><br>1593<br>01:40:17,514 --> 01:40:20,108<br>Both Martin Feldstein<br>and Laura Tyson are members<br><br>1594<br>01:40:20,283 --> 01:40:23,878<br>of Obama's<br>Economic Recovery Advisory Board.<br><br>1595<br>01:40:24,187 --> 01:40:28,886<br>And Obama's chief economic<br>advisor is Larry Summers.<br><br>1596<br>01:40:29,426 --> 01:40:31,257<br>The most senior<br>economic advisors<br><br>1597<br>01:40:31,428 --> 01:40:33,988<br>are the ones who were there,<br>who built the structure.<br><br>1598<br>01:40:34,264 --> 01:40:36,824<br>When it was clear<br>that Summers and Geithner<br><br>1599<br>01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,437<br>were going to play major roles<br>as advisors,<br><br>1600<br>01:40:41,604 --> 01:40:44,140<br>I knew this was<br>going to be status quo.<br><br>1601<br>01:40:44,708 --> 01:40:48,405<br>The Obama administration<br>resisted regulation of bank compensation<br><br>1602<br>01:40:48,578 --> 01:40:51,240<br>even as foreign leaders<br>took action.<br><br>1603<br>01:40:51,414 --> 01:40:53,780<br>The financial industry<br>is a service industry.<br><br>1604<br>01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:57,317<br>It should serve others<br>before it serves itself.<br><br>1605<br>01:40:57,787 --> 01:41:00,779<br>In September of 2009,<br>Christine Lagarde<br><br>1606<br>01:41:00,957 --> 01:41:03,721<br>and the finance ministers<br>of Sweden, the Netherlands,<br><br>1607<br>01:41:03,893 --> 01:41:07,260<br>Luxembourg, Italy,<br>Spain and Germany<br><br>1608<br>01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:10,729<br>called for the G20 nations,<br>including the United States,<br><br>1609<br>01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:14,461<br>to impose strict regulations<br>on bank compensation.<br><br>1610<br>01:41:14,637 --> 01:41:16,605<br>And in July of 2010,<br><br>1611<br>01:41:16,773 --> 01:41:20,766<br>the European Parliament<br>enacted those very regulations.<br><br>1612<br>01:41:21,044 --> 01:41:24,274<br>The Obama administration<br>had no response.<br><br>1613<br>01:41:24,446 --> 01:41:28,473<br>Their view is it's a temporary blip<br>and things will go back to normal.<br><br>1614<br>01:41:28,984 --> 01:41:32,078<br>That is why I am reappointing him<br><br>1615<br>01:41:32,254 --> 01:41:35,246<br>as chairman of the Federal Reserve.<br>Thank you, Ben.<br><br>1616<br>01:41:35,424 --> 01:41:39,258<br>In 2009, Barack Obama<br>reappointed Ben Bernanke.<br><br>1617<br>01:41:39,428 --> 01:41:40,622<br>Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>1618<br>01:41:42,064 --> 01:41:45,966<br>As of mid-2010, not a single<br>senior financial executive<br><br>1619<br>01:41:46,135 --> 01:41:49,127<br>had been criminally prosecuted,<br>or even arrested.<br><br>1620<br>01:41:49,304 --> 01:41:51,864<br>No special prosecutor<br>had been appointed.<br><br>1621<br>01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:54,838<br>Not a single firm had been<br>prosecuted criminally<br><br>1622<br>01:41:55,010 --> 01:41:58,002<br>for securities fraud<br>or accounting fraud.<br><br>1623<br>01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:00,705<br>The Obama administration<br>has made no attempt<br><br>1624<br>01:42:00,883 --> 01:42:02,680<br>to recover any compensation<br><br>1625<br>01:42:02,851 --> 01:42:05,877<br>given to financial executives<br>during the bubble.<br><br>1626<br>01:42:07,055 --> 01:42:10,388<br>I certainly would think<br>of criminal action<br><br>1627<br>01:42:10,559 --> 01:42:14,222<br>against some of Countrywide's<br>top leaders, like Mozilo.<br><br>1628<br>01:42:14,396 --> 01:42:17,729<br>I'd certainly look at Bear Stearns,<br>Goldman Sachs<br><br>1629<br>01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,164<br>and Lehman Brothers<br>and Merrill Lynch.<br><br>1630<br>01:42:20,335 --> 01:42:21,461<br>For criminal prosecutions?<br><br>1631<br>01:42:21,637 --> 01:42:22,797<br>Yes.<br><br>1632<br>01:42:22,971 --> 01:42:26,634<br>In regard to...<br>Yes.
