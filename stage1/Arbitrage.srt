1
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:57,889
<i>But you took a huge
bet on the housing crisis</i>

2
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,126
<i>in the middle of
the biggest boom in housing</i>

3
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,394
<i>anybody has ever seen. Why?</i>

4
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:04,930
<i>I'm a child of the '50s.</i>

5
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,766
<i>My father welded steel for the Navy
and my mother worked at the V.A.</i>

6
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:11,568
<i>They lived through the Depression,
Pearl Harbor, and the Bomb.</i>

7
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:13,772
<i>They didn't think that
bad things might happen.</i>

8
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,374
<i>They knew that bad
things would happen.</i>

9
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,744
<i>- Is that what's happening now?
- When I was a kid,</i>

10
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,745
<i>my favorite teacher
was Mr. James.</i>

11
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:23,648
<i>Mr. James said, "World events
all revolve around five things.</i>

12
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,917
M-O-N-E-Y."

13
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:28,887
This is freshman econ?

14
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:32,524
It was fifth grade econ, but this is
something we've seen over and over again.

15
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,893
Time and time again,
the competition

16
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:38,263
for this limited amount
of dollars out there

17
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,532
can make the best of us manic.

18
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,333
So it's not surprising that
we have these asset bubbles,

19
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:45,770
but when reality sets in,
of course they burst.

20
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:26,544
<i>...economic growth here
at home and geopolitical turmoil</i>

21
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:29,447
<i>weighed on the broad averages.
Commodities continue</i>

22
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:31,515
<i>- the historic run-up in price.
- Here you go.</i>

23
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:33,786
<i>Take a look at the dramatic move
in copper prices, for example,</i>

24
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:37,922
<i>as that once-quiet market has
become a hotbed of activity.</i>

25
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,327
<i>You're disappointed.</i>

26
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,696
Quants?

27
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,398
Derivative structures?
I mean, what was that about?

28
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:49,701
It makes no sense.

29
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,806
That's what you said last time.

30
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,573
Why'd we go down there?

31
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:58,275
<i>- To sign.
- To sign.</i>

32
00:02:58,276 --> 00:02:59,844
<i>- Did we sign?
- No.</i>

33
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:01,014
No. We did not.

34
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:05,316
Instead, I flew 2,000 miles
for a marketing meeting.

35
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,419
Where was Mayfield?

36
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,757
What was this emergency?
What was that about?

37
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:14,559
You speak to the auditors?

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,627
Why?

39
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:20,544
<i>What if we don't sign
this week?</i>

40
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:34,414
See you. Bye.

41
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,697
Look who's here.

42
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,929
What a minute.

43
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,833
<i>How'd you know
I had something there?</i>

44
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:31,802
<i>- No fighting, no fighting.
- Easy, easy, easy.</i>

45
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:34,672
- We had to start. The kids were starving.
- No, no. That's okay.

46
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:38,975
Dad, it's your birthday.
You are spoiling them rotten...

47
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:42,946
- It's my job. God. You guys turned out fine.
- Debatable.

48
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:44,817
- How are you doing, son?
- How'd it go?

49
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,987
Where's my drink?
This is mine? Here?

50
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:52,959
Happy birthday!

51
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,096
Oh-oh, wow.

52
00:04:58,096 --> 00:05:00,597
Hey, kids. Come on,
come on. I need some help.

53
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:02,734
I can't do these by myself.

54
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,737
First of all, you have to make a wish.
Make a really good wish.

55
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,671
I need you to help me out.
Wish and then we go on three.

56
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:08,841
<i>- Got a wish?
- What are you going to wish for?</i>

57
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,377
1... 2... 3.

58
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:14,845
Awesome.

59
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,881
<i>- Excellent.
- Speech.</i>

60
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:19,650
<i>That was really... thank you, thank you.</i>

61
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:21,652
Thank you all very much.
It's such a surprise.

62
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:24,422
I didn't even know
it was my birthday.

63
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:26,457
What did Mark Twain
say about... he said,

64
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:30,061
"Old age is clearly
a case of mind over matter.

65
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:31,896
If you don't mind,
it doesn't matter."

66
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:34,799
I've done a lot of things in my life.

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,402
I've worked very hard,
but being here,

68
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,737
looking around...

69
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:43,508
at all these shining,
radiant faces,

70
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,676
<i>I know that my best work
is right here</i>

71
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,677
<i>in this room, right now.</i>

72
00:05:47,678 --> 00:05:49,982
I'm deeply proud of all of
you, and that's the best gift

73
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,616
your mom and I could ever hope for.
So thank you.

74
00:05:52,617 --> 00:05:54,683
And to have sold the company
to Standard this morning.

75
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:56,721
- Hey, hey, hey. Yes, that's true,
- All right, not now.

76
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:58,823
But no business tonight.
No business.

77
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:02,559
Although your
one-pointed mind assures me

78
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,696
that you have not only your
mom's genes, you got mine, too.

79
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:07,664
I know it's very
uncharacteristic of me,

80
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:10,134
but I just want you to know that
it's probably taken me 60 years

81
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:13,604
for me to really understand
what's truly important,

82
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:16,707
and that's you guys.
So I love you all very much.

83
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,076
<i>- Aww.
- Hear, hear.</i>

84
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,579
<i>Love you.</i>

85
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:22,879
I'll take a big piece.

86
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:26,450
You can wait. You can wait
a little while longer.

87
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:28,654
<i>- I don't know about me as a mom.
- No, no, no. You should have.</i>

88
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:32,088
I want more kids, everywhere.
I want more "yous" around.

89
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:35,460
It's all about you, is it?

90
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,565
- Four and 19.
- All right.

91
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,232
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yah.

92
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:45,035
- So what was that all about?
- What?

93
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:46,769
The last time you gave
a speech like that,

94
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,240
we lost the bid to Firestone.

95
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,842
Yeah, well, I don't know.

96
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:54,182
I just wanted it to be
about the family tonight.

97
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:59,987
- Did you see this?
- Yeah.

98
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:04,789
You know how I feel
about that. Trash can.

99
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,125
Peter has a copy pinned up
in the conference room.

100
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:11,061
Well, are you going to keep
skirtin' around it?

101
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:12,864
Why sell our company?

102
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:16,600
We make a great return.

103
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,703
We give money to the
causes we believe in,

104
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,239
that we know are important.
We love what we do.

105
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,542
My darling, you are still
in your 20s. I'm 60.

106
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:28,112
That is a huge difference
of point of view.

107
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:29,914
- Dad.
- Yes?

108
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:32,616
You are not old.

109
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:35,919
- Last year was our best year...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. It catches up, all right?

110
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,989
Maybe there's some other
things I'd like to do.

111
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,791
Maybe I would like to spend
a little more time

112
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,659
with you guys

113
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,831
outside the office.

114
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:48,131
- What?
- I'm just trying to imagine

115
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:49,742
what we would do.

116
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,975
Where are you going?

117
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:01,145
<i>- The office.
- Now?</i>

118
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:03,814
Yeah, I've got to finish up
that thing.

119
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:05,785
Aww, but...

120
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:11,222
I haven't given you
your birthday present yet.

121
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:13,114
Then I'll come back
as soon as I can.

122
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:37,715
Just keep it.

123
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:40,084
Yeah, Gavin. It's me.
When you get this...

124
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:41,019
could you call
Chris Vogler at Fremaut?

125
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,519
Tell him that I need to talk
to him right away. Thanks.

126
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:01,808
Hey.

127
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,625
What's wrong?

128
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,859
<i>All right, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I'm late.</i>

129
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,630
<i>I'm always late.
You know that. I'm sorry.</i>

130
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,738
<i>And I'm always saying
I'm sorry, but...</i>

131
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,379
it doesn't mean I wouldn't
rather be here with you.

132
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,416
The show's gonna be beautiful.

133
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,231
- You gonna be there?
- I will be there.

134
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,734
Oh, wow. That's great.

135
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:08,205
- I made this for you.
- You made this?

136
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:10,407
This is amazing.

137
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:11,957
One candle.
Thank you very much.

138
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:28,452
I want you.

139
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:14,778
<i>He's waiting.</i>

140
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:21,116
Thank you, Diane.

141
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:29,889
- So...
- I'm here.

142
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:33,423
Guess what's not.

143
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:36,127
- Jeffrey, I told you. I'm working on it.
- You're working on it. Yeah.

144
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,995
<i>- I'm working on it.
- Well, while you're doing that,</i>

145
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:40,397
- let me tell you what's not working.
- Okay.

146
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,966
What's not working
is my $412 million

147
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:45,769
that's sitting in your account
so you can pass your audit.

148
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,204
The $412 million

149
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:49,907
you needed, you said,
for two weeks.

150
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:52,442
<i>And which has been
languishing now for 32 days</i>

151
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:55,412
<i>while it could be elsewhere
invested, earning an actual return</i>

152
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:58,415
instead of couching this absurd
lie that you're spinning.

153
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:02,153
- What do you want me to say?
- That you're going to get a signature from Mayfield

154
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,090
and that my hostage money and my fee
are going to be sent to me promptly,

155
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,296
say, eh, by tomorrow?

156
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:13,032
I'm solving the problem.

157
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:16,432
I'm going to get your money
and your fee.

158
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:19,436
- You will have it very shortly.
- When?

159
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:23,541
As soon as they sign
the fucking contract.

160
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,576
You know, I'm not the one
with the liability.

161
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:28,144
I just made a loan.

162
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:29,947
You're looking
at 1,000 years' jail time

163
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:33,450
- for fraudulent conveyance...
- Stop it! You don't have to talk to me like that, Jeff.

164
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:34,984
I didn't get you
into this mess.

165
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:37,387
- Remember when you asked me if it was a good idea...
- Would a friend...

166
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:39,057
- You were a friend of mine...
- ...to convert half your liquid assets

167
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,160
into a fucking copper mine?
What did I tell you?

168
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,397
Are we done?
I think we're done here.

169
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,000
Friday morning
I take my money back.

170
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,001
<i>- You can't do that.
- The fuck I can't.</i>

171
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:53,171
- It's in an escrow bill with one big...
- I need that money

172
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,239
in there until they sign,
Jeffrey!

173
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,509
What if they check again?
What am I supposed to do?

174
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,451
It's not my problem, is it?

175
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:08,869
Not your fucking problem.

176
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,340
Let's go.

177
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:37,314
<i>...as well, especially Russia,</i>

178
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:39,984
where fears of further
nationalization appear to be

179
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,419
<i>scaring away international investors.</i>

180
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,523
<i>The Dow off to a strong start this morning
on a bevy of news firmly pointing</i>

181
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:48,158
<i>to an economy picking up steam.</i>

182
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,629
<i>Including a surprisingly strong number...</i>

183
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,465
<i>- What?
- 7:30 this evening, the Four Seasons.</i>

184
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:58,201
<i>- We'll get it straight with Mayfield then.
- Good, good. Very good.</i>

185
00:13:58,202 --> 00:14:01,171
- Is this too blue?
- That's the third one you've tried on.

186
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:03,344
Will you just relax?
It looks fabulous.

187
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:08,381
What's going on?

188
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:13,117
Ay yi yi, I look old.

189
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,619
You look regal and wise

190
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,354
and, granted, a little worried.

191
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:20,292
What is going on? Are you
afraid of this meeting?

192
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,191
They haven't signed the papers.

193
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:25,095
- Oh, I thought that's why you went down there.
- Yeah, so did I.

194
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:27,665
For some reason,
they're stalling...

195
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,234
- and I didn't sleep on the plane.
- Aww.

196
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:32,970
Well, it's all going to be fine. It always is.
Just follow the plan.

197
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:35,705
- And what is that plan?
- Confidence equals contract.

198
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:39,310
- You sound like a fortune cookie.
- They are your words, actually.

199
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:43,047
- Then you married an idiot.
- Okay, but I was thinking, idiot,

200
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,481
that maybe after
the deal is done,

201
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:47,518
which it definitely will be,

202
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,086
maybe we could just take off.
What do you say?

203
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:51,721
Let's have an adventure.

204
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:53,488
Pete's in the best place
he's ever been,

205
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:55,226
your daughter,
as always, is brilliant.

206
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,994
- Yeah.
- Right?

207
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:59,129
So I want to have some fun.

208
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,733
I want to have fun with you. Let's
go to Rovella. The house there.

209
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:06,369
- We haven't been there forever.
- I just haven't had time.

210
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,306
We have to make time.
We could take a year.

211
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,274
Let's take a year
and get fat and have fun

212
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:13,210
and go on an adventure.

213
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:15,745
I mean, seriously,
how much money do we need?

214
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:18,046
Do you want to be the richest
guy in the cemetery?

215
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,351
- I don't want to be in the cemetery.
- Oh, by the way,

216
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,418
Mary called from
St. Victor's Hospital again.

217
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:23,755
- She hasn't gotten the check.
- Yeah, I'm taking care of that.

218
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,024
The gala is Friday.
Should I be selling my ring?

219
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:30,661
- What's going on?
- I've had to move a lot of things around for this merger.

220
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:32,427
It hasn't been easy.
It's very complicated.

221
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:34,399
- It's only two million.
- Only two million?

222
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,267
- Yeah.
- You remember Riccio's?

223
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:40,738
- Yeah.
- Four meals, two bucks.

224
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,207
All you can eat, three bucks.

225
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,210
I do remember,

226
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,612
but I do not remember
you being this sentimental,

227
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,010
unless you're trying
to change the subject.

228
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,317
I don't know
what you're talking about.

229
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,667
<i>Yup.</i>

230
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,368
Hello, how are you?

231
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:13,138
- Good evening, Mr. Miller. Nice to see you.
- Julian.

232
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,705
Your table has been waiting

233
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:17,508
and your guests are here.

234
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,779
Excellent.

235
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,549
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

236
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:28,752
- Where the hell is Mayfield?
- I don't know.

237
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:31,721
- Mr. Miller. Thank you so much for coming.
- Hello. No, no, no, no.

238
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:32,990
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah, yeah.

239
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,658
We were just getting acquainted
with Peter and Brooke here.

240
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:39,095
- I hope they didn't beat you up too much.
- No, no. They've been terrific.

241
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:41,330
Dad, we've been talking
about operations.

242
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:43,534
<i>Tim thinks once we consolidate,</i>

243
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:47,171
<i>we can save about...
50% on our back office costs.</i>

244
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,739
Yeah, I'd like to hear
more about that,

245
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,310
but, eh, I had thought
that Mr. Mayfield

246
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,079
planned to meet us
here tonight.

247
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,380
Yeah, Jim should be here
in about 20 minutes.

248
00:16:57,381 --> 00:17:00,216
He suggested that we
get right into details.

249
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:01,719
I was just saying to Brooke,
now that we can market

250
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,754
<i>your quants track records,</i>

251
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:06,089
<i>we have access
to a host of new capital.</i>

252
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:10,160
And we've got something very special,
something we're thrilled about.

253
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:13,229
New capital is exciting.

254
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,599
<i>- That's why we're here.
- Talk to us a bit about oversight.</i>

255
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,569
<i>I mean, obviously we've been very
successful at what we do because...</i>

256
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,472
We hope that it spreads
across... oh, thank you.

257
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:25,508
Assuming we shed debt through
some small liquidations,

258
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:28,511
we're looking at a
significant uptake in ROI.

259
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:30,713
<i>I don't want to pin
a number on it,</i>

260
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:33,249
<i>but they... significant in
the first quarter alone.</i>

261
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,384
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We've been here

262
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:37,754
almost two hours now.
Where is Mr. Mayfield?

263
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:39,890
He just texted me.

264
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:43,126
He's very sorry,
but he's been detained.

265
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:46,400
Detained? Where?

266
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,767
All right. I think I can
trust you with my family.

267
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:53,371
- Oh, yeah.
- Of course. Mr. Miller, again, it was a privilege.

268
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,806
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Dad, Dad? Excuse me.

269
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:58,242
This is the bullshit way
you try to close a deal?

270
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,278
Port. Would you like
some... to have some port?

271
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,248
- Dad. Did you get my message?
- Yeah?

272
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,382
- No, what's up?
- We need to sit down.

273
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:06,883
What is it?

274
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:09,886
- I can't talk about it here.
- Brooke, I...

275
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:14,391
I found some strange entries
in the Old Hill books.

276
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,527
- What kind of entries?
- I don't know yet,

277
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,495
but something
is definitely off.

278
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:20,497
All right, all right.

279
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:24,168
Come by around 11:00 tomorrow.
We'll look at it then. Okay?

280
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,768
And, Brooke?

281
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:28,309
See if you can find out what
happened with Mayfield. All right?

282
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,757
Excuse me. Thanks.

283
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:52,362
- Good evening, Mr. Miller.
- Hey.

284
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:54,964
- So how are they doing?
- Great. Everyone loves them.

285
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:58,438
- How are they doing?
- So-so.

286
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:02,272
- Where's Julie?
- She's in the back.

287
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:04,777
Thanks.

288
00:19:39,777 --> 00:19:41,545
So...

289
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:43,981
I've seen you've met already.
It's Victor Rodriguez.

290
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,883
<i>- Isn't it amazing?
- He's extraordinary.</i>

291
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:48,919
- Great show.
- Oh, this is Robert Miller.

292
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,188
One of our collectors.

293
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,656
- This is Alex Stanton and their daughter Ava.
- Alex.

294
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:56,727
- She's a talented young artist.
- Really? Painter?

295
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,029
- Drawing.
- Drawing? That's great.

296
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:01,931
So, eh, I like the size
of the paintings.

297
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:03,005
I want to talk to you
about them in a second.

298
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,885
- Why are you doing this?
- Go away.

299
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:23,854
Emma, let me see the list.

300
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:27,891
- I will take these two.
- Okay.

301
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:31,295
- What's the Rubik's Cube in the back there?
- Right there. Number seven.

302
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,797
All right. Great.
Don't tell her it was me.

303
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:35,298
- No problem.
- I mean it.

304
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:36,693
You got it.

305
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:23,818
Excuse me.

306
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:30,787
<i>- Who is this?
- It's me.</i>

307
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:33,957
<i>- What do you want?
- I'm here.</i>

308
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,492
- Where?
- I'm in your bedroom.

309
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:38,829
Came in the back. Can you get
those people out of here?

310
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,800
- Are you serious?
- Look at your bedroom door. Do you see me?

311
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,846
<i>- Yeah, I see you.
- I'm serious.</i>

312
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,846
Excuse me, guys.

313
00:21:56,847 --> 00:22:00,888
<i>I'm sorry. I know, I know.</i>

314
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,890
You just come in and out
whenever you want?

315
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:10,093
I thought we should talk.

316
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:13,430
One damn night in a month.

317
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:15,898
- I told you it was important to me.
- I was working.

318
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:17,501
You understand that?

319
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,469
I have obligations.

320
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,069
- I don't want to hear...
- I'm under a lot of pressure right now.

321
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,904
- I don't want to hear about your obligations!
- I could use a little help.

322
00:22:22,905 --> 00:22:24,709
If you cared,
you would have been there.

323
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,576
I was there. I was there!

324
00:22:26,577 --> 00:22:29,578
I was late, but I was there.
And I'm here now.

325
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:32,149
No, no, no. You're here when it's
convenient for you to be here.

326
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,491
Love means you fucking show up.

327
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:42,496
<i>Sorry.</i>

328
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:49,900
- Why did you buy those paintings?
- Because I liked them.

329
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:55,838
<i>Okay. Thank you
for helping me to get started,</i>

330
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,742
but if I'm going to fail,
then let me fail.

331
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:02,212
<i>Julie, you won't fail.
Why would you fail?</i>

332
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:04,914
You know,

333
00:23:04,915 --> 00:23:07,050
I'm not the kind of guy
that wants to throw money away.

334
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:11,188
You want to start a business, you
have to project a certain image.

335
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,027
<i>- What image?
- Success.</i>

336
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,795
The market is a disaster
right now.

337
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,729
<i>For everybody.
No one's moving anything.</i>

338
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,834
<i>So that's why
you've got to show sales.</i>

339
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,068
People look at you then
and they say,

340
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:27,970
"Wow, how did she do that?"

341
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:30,548
<i>That's what they remember.
Always.</i>

342
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:39,054
You're never
going to leave her.

343
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,837
Come away with me.

344
00:24:00,837 --> 00:24:03,977
Let's take your car and go.

345
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,779
Where?

346
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:12,582
It's a place I'm staying.

347
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:16,118
Beautiful, on the water.

348
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,625
We could wake up there,
together, just you and me.

349
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:25,604
- I'd like that.
- Me, too.

350
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:37,744
<i># Just one more chance #</i>

351
00:24:40,744 --> 00:24:46,153
<i># To prove it's you alone
I care for #</i>

352
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:53,595
<i># Each night I say
a little prayer for #</i>

353
00:24:57,595 --> 00:25:01,936
<i># Just one more chance #</i>

354
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:09,849
<i># Just one more night. #</i>

355
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:27,865
Ahh!

356
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:46,875
Jul... Julie?

357
00:25:46,876 --> 00:25:49,971
Julie?

358
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:15,980
God!

359
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:34,300
Fuck!

360
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,287
Fuck!

361
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:01,419
Ow!

362
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:12,022
- Yes, I want to make it collect.
- Your name, sir?

363
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:16,500
Lawrence Grant.

364
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,769
<i>Who the fuck is this?</i>

365
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:28,438
Jimmy, it's me.

366
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:31,775
<i>Robert?</i>

367
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,913
I want you to listen to me
very, very closely.

368
00:28:36,913 --> 00:28:38,516
<i>Vehicle is
1978, brown Mercedes,</i>

369
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,916
<i>- registered to a Julie Cote.
- Douche.</i>

370
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:44,386
<i>5-1-1-20 40th street.
Subject is a French national.</i>

371
00:28:44,387 --> 00:28:46,789
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

372
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,526
Catching Detective wants us
to rule before he calls it.

373
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,194
We've been having the same
fucking argument for 20 years.

374
00:28:52,195 --> 00:28:54,365
He can't handle one drunk
motorist who kills herself?

375
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:57,066
You know what? I'm not
so sure about this.

376
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:59,835
If the car rolled
on multiple impacts,

377
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:03,910
but she was here
and her feet were down here.

378
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,018
So who kicked out the door?

379
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,997
Let's go.

380
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:29,035
You want to tell me
what this is?

381
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,935
Better you don't ask.

382
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:35,971
So all you're saying is you
need a ride somewhere.

383
00:29:35,972 --> 00:29:38,608
- That's correct.
- Because I'm going to be very clear about this. All right?

384
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:41,911
You called me up for a ride.
I showed up, I gave you a ride.

385
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:44,314
No, you didn't. We're not here.

386
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,018
Then where the fuck are we?

387
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:52,255
We're both asleep
right now, at home.

388
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,124
- Which is where you left your phone, right?
- Right.

389
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:58,327
- Yeah, 'cause if anyone checks...
- Why is anybody going to check?

390
00:29:58,328 --> 00:30:01,932
Well, they're not.
As long as we're not here.

391
00:30:02,932 --> 00:30:05,634
- Anybody know you're here?
- No.

392
00:30:05,635 --> 00:30:09,174
- Somebody knows you're here?
- No.

393
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:15,143
- Somebody knows you're not there?
- My girl, but...

394
00:30:15,144 --> 00:30:18,047
- Ah, Jimmy! Jesus Christ!
- You call me up at 2:00 a.m.!

395
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:19,316
- What the fuck you want?
- I fucking told you!

396
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,588
She asked me where I was going.
All right?

397
00:30:25,588 --> 00:30:27,624
All right, what did you say?

398
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,328
I told her
I had to run out a minute.

399
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:35,530
- You trust her?
- Is this the kind of shit you used to do to my dad?

400
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:38,034
- Do you trust her?
- Yes, I fucking trust her!

401
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:40,203
- I fucking trust her.
- All right, all right. Good.

402
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:43,439
- Good. You're at home and I'm at home.
- Jesus.

403
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,142
My wife gets up
at 5:00 a.m. for Pilates.

404
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:48,644
I'll be there next to her. That's
where I've been all night long.

405
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:50,914
- You do the same with yours.
- I don't know, man.

406
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,950
- This is some pretty fucked-up shit. Seriously.
- Jimmy, just fucking do it.

407
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:55,417
- Don't think about it...
- No, fuck that, man!

408
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:57,219
I don't hear from you
since the fucking funeral,

409
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,621
you call me up out of the
blue, using my father's name?

410
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:02,092
What is it? Do you want money?
Is that what you want?

411
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,593
I'll give you money, all right?

412
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:06,595
I will give you $5,000...
I will give you $10,000...

413
00:31:06,596 --> 00:31:09,065
$20,000. I'll give you
whatever you fucking...

414
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:11,001
You want to talk to me like this?!
You can get the fuck out of my car

415
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:14,671
and you can walk.
You want that?

416
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:20,108
- You want to fucking walk home?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

417
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:24,079
I'm sorry.
I'm not myself right now.

418
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,517
You came and you picked me up.
I need your help, you helped me.

419
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:31,227
I need your help. I'm sorry.

420
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:38,631
You all right?

421
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:43,132
Jesus, man!
What the fuck happened to you?

422
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:45,668
- We got to get you to a hospital. Right now.
- No, no.

423
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:48,236
- I just got to get home.
- Rob, it looks like you're bleeding inside, man.

424
00:31:48,237 --> 00:31:49,007
I'll deal with it
in a couple of hours.

425
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:52,976
What if you don't make it
a couple of hours?

426
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,229
Then I don't make it.

427
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:14,364
Call me, all right?

428
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,234
Let me know everything is okay.

429
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:20,074
Yeah, it's best
we don't talk for a while.

430
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:25,641
Hey, yo!

431
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:27,410
So that's it?

432
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:29,115
You get in a bind and just call
up the only nigga you know?

433
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:34,486
Jimmy.

434
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:38,589
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

435
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:41,691
<i>- Go on home.
- Yeah, all right.</i>

436
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:43,503
<i>- Just go.
- You take care of that.</i>

437
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:28,284
Fuck!

438
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,321
<i>Everything okay, sir?</i>

439
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:47,123
No, I'm fine, Glen.
Go back to bed.

440
00:34:20,123 --> 00:34:23,326
<i>- Where did you go?
- What?</i>

441
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,364
I woke up and you weren't here.

442
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:31,737
- I just went to get some ice cream.
- Mm. Was it good?

443
00:34:34,737 --> 00:34:38,406
- Yes.
- Good.

444
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:41,746
Don't forget to take your
Lipitor in the morning.

445
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:46,818
- Ellen.
- Hmm?

446
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:53,670
- Do you still love me?
- Of course I do.

447
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,705
Hypothetically,
the situation you're describing

448
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:12,908
would be
involuntary manslaughter.

449
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:16,946
- Such a person...
- Would be in a lot of trouble.

450
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,448
Especially if that person
were closing a merger

451
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:20,750
with a large public bank

452
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,886
where any publicity
or arrest could delay

453
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:26,189
or derail the transaction,

454
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,890
but that's only
if there were some evidence

455
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:31,259
that could link him
to the crime.

456
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,430
- Fingerprints? DNA?
- Very hard to collect after an explosion.

457
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:38,670
Real world is different
from television.

458
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,504
What about cell phone records?

459
00:35:42,505 --> 00:35:46,274
- Did this person make any calls from the area?
- Not from a cell phone. No.

460
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:48,778
Then they won't be able
to place him there.

461
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:52,948
What would you advise
such a person to do?

462
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:56,352
To confess immediately.

463
00:35:56,353 --> 00:35:59,855
- Failing which?
- To put as much distance between himself

464
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:02,959
<i>and the event as possible.
If possible.</i>

465
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,361
But let me tell you something.

466
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:09,497
And I'm speaking to you
as a friend now.

467
00:36:09,498 --> 00:36:12,500
There's about 50 things that
person wouldn't have thought of.

468
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:16,738
And the more time that passes,
the more lies that are told,

469
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:18,978
the worse it gets for him.

470
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,812
<i>- Robert?
- Yeah?</i>

471
00:36:23,813 --> 00:36:27,850
- They're going to come to you.
- I know.

472
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:30,886
An accident
is not the worst trouble.

473
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:33,955
If we talk to them now,
we can probably work it out.

474
00:36:33,956 --> 00:36:36,692
Now you tell me what happens

475
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:38,761
if the Standard deal
does not close.

476
00:36:38,762 --> 00:36:42,832
- I got to tell my investors about our real losses.
- Nothing good.

477
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,800
What did you say about
the Justice Department?

478
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:47,669
Depending on what they
decide to arrest me on?

479
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,847
- Fraud conviction gets me 20 years?
- I did.

480
00:36:56,847 --> 00:37:00,530
What choice do I really have?

481
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,764
<i>Now, you're aware
Congress plans to extend</i>

482
00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:18,066
<i>the audit requirements
for private funds?</i>

483
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:19,900
<i>Of course I am aware.</i>

484
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:21,536
<i>I gave testimony
to the committee.</i>

485
00:37:21,537 --> 00:37:23,440
<i>- You know this.
- I know, but anyway,</i>

486
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,441
Standard wants to prepare
for it now.

487
00:37:25,442 --> 00:37:27,543
So I was asked to go through
every one of your trading books

488
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:31,314
<i>- and reconfirm the assets.
- No, no. Absolutely not. It's impossible.</i>

489
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,083
Don't worry, I gave
different books to the team

490
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,884
and I kept Old Hill for myself.

491
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,953
Anyway, I'm here to tell you...
I cleared it.

492
00:37:37,954 --> 00:37:41,390
<i>- The audit's cleared?
- The report will be issued today.</i>

493
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:43,695
Actually, I'm calling it
my "swan song."

494
00:37:45,695 --> 00:37:48,663
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, on Friday. You know, it's a five-year clock.

495
00:37:48,664 --> 00:37:52,600
- And why?
- To prevent exactly what we're doing, but honestly...

496
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:56,372
<i>...there is nothing left to worry about.
It's great.</i>

497
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:59,978
<i>- Get out.
- Okay.</i>

498
00:38:02,978 --> 00:38:05,480
<i>- What?
- How was it?</i>

499
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:07,350
- What?
- The show.

500
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,010
What the fuck are you
talking about?

501
00:38:09,018 --> 00:38:11,956
The show. Julie's show.

502
00:38:13,956 --> 00:38:16,424
Oh, yeah.

503
00:38:16,425 --> 00:38:18,526
Yeah, it was fine.

504
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:20,030
- Mayfield's here.
- He's here? Where?

505
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,430
<i>Sherry-Netherland. He checked
in about an hour ago.</i>

506
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,902
- He called?
- No. Brooke has a friend on the executive committee

507
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,870
<i>who said he's taking
meetings in his room.</i>

508
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:30,842
I don't know.
Maybe he's settling in.

509
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,377
You think we're dealing
with a fucking idiot?

510
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,012
I spoke to legal. They said
that Standard will sign

511
00:38:37,012 --> 00:38:39,047
<i>once they get the audit report.</i>

512
00:38:39,048 --> 00:38:41,083
- Yeah, it's being issued now.
- How do you know that?

513
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:43,886
Never mind that. Just find out
why Mayfield hasn't called us.

514
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:46,522
- How am I supposed to...
- Do I have to do every goddamn thing myself?

515
00:38:46,523 --> 00:38:48,556
Just find out, will you?
Please?

516
00:38:48,557 --> 00:38:50,574
Thank you.

517
00:39:04,574 --> 00:39:08,511
- I really can't reconcile this.
- Reconcile what?

518
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,413
The Old Hill fund.

519
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,784
Dad, are you listening to me?

520
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,155
Yeah, of course I'm listening.

521
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,790
Okay, those trades
are in the special book.

522
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:23,426
They don't get audited here
on the same balance sheet.

523
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,761
Wait, but look at the sheet.
There's a $400 million hole here.

524
00:39:26,762 --> 00:39:28,170
I mean, that can't be right.

525
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,203
- Evening.
- May I help you?

526
00:39:35,204 --> 00:39:37,105
Detective Bryer.

527
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:40,109
- I was hoping to see Mr. Miller.
- Is he expecting you?

528
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,944
Possibly.

529
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:44,146
<i>I really have no
idea what's going on,</i>

530
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:46,848
but the way
that this sheet reads...

531
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:50,653
- half of the fund's assets are missing.
- That's ridiculous.

532
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,989
- I mean, it can't be right.
- Right. It's ridiculous

533
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,989
- and yet that's what...
- Okay, okay, look.

534
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,059
<i>I... I'll look into this. I promise you.</i>

535
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,794
I'll look into it.

536
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:03,202
- Yeah.
- There's a Detective Bryer here to see you.

537
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:08,203
- Eh, give me a minute, then send him in.
- Okay.

538
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:11,707
- Thanks.
- Is everything okay?

539
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:14,576
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's just...

540
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:16,146
my next meeting came here
a little early. That's all.

541
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,848
We're going to have to pick
this up later.

542
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,750
Mom is looking
for the hospital check.

543
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,898
Brooke, we'll pick it up later.

544
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:36,865
<i>Detective Bryer? Hi, I'm Cindy.</i>

545
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:39,366
Mr. Miller's personal assistant.
Right this way.

546
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:53,883
Yeah, sorry to keep you waiting.
You can sit there.

547
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,651
<i>We just heard about it.
Really terrible.</i>

548
00:40:56,652 --> 00:40:58,722
<i>- Okay, so you're an investor in the gallery?
- Correct.</i>

549
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:03,591
- How did you meet her?
- Eh... through... I think it was a charity function.

550
00:41:03,592 --> 00:41:06,761
- My wife and I have a foundation.
- Okay.

551
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:11,165
- When did you last see her?
- Last night. At the gallery.

552
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:14,569
<i>- You stayed till the doors closed?
- No, I...</i>

553
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,272
I was only there a couple of minutes.
I think I left around 10.

554
00:41:17,273 --> 00:41:20,142
- Where did you go?
- Home.

555
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:21,012
<i>- You go straight home?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

556
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,745
- You stayed home?
- Yeah.

557
00:41:23,746 --> 00:41:27,283
- Your wife home?
- Yes.

558
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:31,620
Okay. Okay, so now
back to the gallery.

559
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:35,124
<i>- Did you see her with anyone?
- See her... what do you mean?</i>

560
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:38,195
<i>I mean, like, boyfriend. Someone
she might of left with?</i>

561
00:41:40,195 --> 00:41:42,297
Not that I noticed. No, no.

562
00:41:42,298 --> 00:41:46,201
The reason I ask is
we haven't located the driver.

563
00:41:46,202 --> 00:41:47,771
<i>- The driver?
- Yeah, the driver.</i>

564
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:50,738
Someone else was driving. So...

565
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:54,042
sometimes the driver
will go for help

566
00:41:54,043 --> 00:41:56,745
and he'll die tryin'...
you know,

567
00:41:56,746 --> 00:41:58,046
- so...
- This is awful.

568
00:41:58,047 --> 00:41:59,016
<i>- Yeah.
- This is truly awful.</i>

569
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:02,116
We're searching
the area right now.

570
00:42:02,117 --> 00:42:05,888
<i>So no boyfriend, no...
that you know of?</i>

571
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:07,824
Actually, we didn't talk
about personal matters.

572
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,759
- She was just an employee, right?
- She... well, not an employee.

573
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,628
- I was an investor.
- Why did you invest?

574
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:14,930
- Why did I invest?
- Yeah, why did you invest?

575
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:20,301
She had a great eye. She... actually,
she found me these Brice Mardens here.

576
00:42:20,302 --> 00:42:22,837
<i>They went up in value
very quickly,</i>

577
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:25,775
and it was on the basis of that that I
agreed to fund some of the gallery.

578
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:29,178
All right. Do you mind
if we search her apartment?

579
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,714
- Why would I mind?
- Well, it's in your company's name. So...

580
00:42:32,715 --> 00:42:35,951
Right. Oh, yeah. Of course.

581
00:42:35,952 --> 00:42:37,919
Yeah. Sure. Go ahead.

582
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,890
<i>- Now, Mr. Miller.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

583
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:45,627
Why would you lease
an apartment for Miss Cote?

584
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:48,696
I mean, is that something that you
would normally do for an employee?

585
00:42:48,697 --> 00:42:50,766
Well, actually, I said
that she wasn't an employee.

586
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:54,335
But she... I think she'd
just come over from Paris,

587
00:42:54,336 --> 00:42:57,238
if I remember, and she needed
a place to entertain buyers.

588
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:58,806
So you leased her an apartment?

589
00:42:58,807 --> 00:43:01,243
Well, it was through
the holding company.

590
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:03,014
You are a little confused by all
this, aren't you?

591
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:07,883
- I am, I am, but I'll get there. Give me time.
- All right.

592
00:43:07,884 --> 00:43:11,352
Now I don't mean to be
indelicate, but...

593
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:13,988
But you're going to
be indelicate.

594
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:16,991
From what I can gather, she
wasn't exactly an art star.

595
00:43:16,992 --> 00:43:19,161
<i>She worked for a couple
of dealers in Paris, but...</i>

596
00:43:19,162 --> 00:43:22,263
Okay, I get it. So why would I invest
in her and help her find a place?

597
00:43:22,264 --> 00:43:24,001
<i>- Something like that, yeah.
- It's very simple, Detective.</i>

598
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:28,037
I invest in people
I believe in.

599
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:31,874
I thought she'd do well.
I backed her, she did.

600
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,410
- It's as simple as that.
- Well, that seems to make sense.

601
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:37,879
- Yeah.
- We all good with the apartment, then, right?

602
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,114
- Yeah, yeah. That's fine. Go ahead.
- Thanks.

603
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:42,417
- What happened to your head?
- What?

604
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:44,751
Your head. What happened to
your head? That's a nasty cut.

605
00:43:44,752 --> 00:43:46,119
I've been looking at that
for the last five minutes.

606
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,023
- Does it hurt you?
- No, no, no. I just...

607
00:43:48,023 --> 00:43:51,829
- I hit it on the medicine cabinet.
- Last night?

608
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:55,464
- This morning.
- Hate when that happens.

609
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:59,167
- Me, too.
- Yeah. Well, thanks for the chat.

610
00:43:59,168 --> 00:44:01,143
No problem.

611
00:44:08,143 --> 00:44:11,245
Ellen Miller's office.

612
00:44:11,246 --> 00:44:14,415
And it transformed them.
Seriously.

613
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:16,852
There's a Detective Bryer
in the lobby.

614
00:44:16,853 --> 00:44:18,986
And thanks again
for your generosity.

615
00:44:18,987 --> 00:44:21,256
All right. I'll see you then.
Bye-bye.

616
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:23,759
- Sorry, what?
- A Detective Bryer.

617
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,893
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

618
00:44:25,894 --> 00:44:29,098
Well, I'm late, so I just
can't deal with it right now.

619
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,601
- Okay. What about these?
- Send them a thank-you note.

620
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:33,876
- Zappos has been so generous. Thanks. Bye, guys.
- Okay. No problem.

621
00:44:40,876 --> 00:44:43,278
- Mrs. Miller?
- Yes.

622
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:46,314
- Detective Bryer.
- Did you just call my office?

623
00:44:46,315 --> 00:44:48,451
- Yeah, I was hoping to talk to you.
- I don't have time right now.

624
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:51,185
- Sorry.
- It will just take a couple of seconds.

625
00:44:51,186 --> 00:44:55,849
- This is about your husband.
- Well, fine, but make an appointment.

626
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:24,085
- How'd it go?
- Well, the wife blew me off.

627
00:45:24,086 --> 00:45:27,055
Which was interesting.

628
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:29,425
He didn't admit to the affair,
but then he wouldn't, would he?

629
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:32,998
- Why didn't you pick him out?
- He's a very rich man.

630
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:38,399
- Anything?
- Yeah, about 10 million prints.

631
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,568
- What happened with the pay phones?
- Got about 15 calls

632
00:45:40,569 --> 00:45:42,806
in a three-mile... two of them
look a little strange.

633
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:45,306
Got an incoming, which is
probably a local drug deal.

634
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,010
- And the one we care about?
- Collect call. About a minute and a half.

635
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:51,180
- Made from the Chevron station on Westlake Road.
- Who'd he call?

636
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:55,551
Cell phone in Harlem.
Still waiting on the address.

637
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:59,187
So you're at the crash site.

638
00:45:59,188 --> 00:46:03,457
All right, and you
make it out of the car.

639
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:06,060
Now you're smart enough

640
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:07,562
not to use your own cell phone.

641
00:46:07,563 --> 00:46:11,033
So you get to a pay phone
and you're a billionaire.

642
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:13,602
Right? You're a billionaire.

643
00:46:13,603 --> 00:46:16,337
So what do you do?

644
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:18,012
You call someone in Harlem?

645
00:46:23,012 --> 00:46:25,180
Robert?

646
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:28,317
I just heard about Julie.
I'm so sorry.

647
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,453
Her gallery called.
Her mom's flying in today.

648
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:34,455
Her mom.

649
00:46:34,456 --> 00:46:37,192
- Service here?
- Tomorrow. 9:00 a.m.

650
00:46:37,193 --> 00:46:39,493
Wow. We should pick up
the expenses for that.

651
00:46:39,494 --> 00:46:41,330
Whatever she wants.

652
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:42,931
You take care of that
personally for me?

653
00:46:42,932 --> 00:46:44,366
- Of course.
- Thanks.

654
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:47,935
- You all right?
- Did you get ahold of Mayfield?

655
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:49,338
<i>No. Not yet, but we'll get him.</i>

656
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:53,911
<i>- Robert? I...
- Thanks.</i>

657
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:56,418
I appreciate your concern.

658
00:47:02,418 --> 00:47:05,953
<i>Let's flash
him, let's flash him.</i>

659
00:47:05,954 --> 00:47:08,457
<i>Hold on, you gonna go...</i>

660
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:11,326
- Wait, right here. Mr. Grant?
- Yes.

661
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:13,931
NYPD Homicide. Do you mind
stepping in the car, please?

662
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:16,465
- What's this about?
- Just get in the car, Jimmy.

663
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,304
- Am I under arrest?
- Do you want to be?

664
00:47:22,304 --> 00:47:26,607
- So let's do this again.
- Man, for what? My answers ain't going to change.

665
00:47:26,608 --> 00:47:29,512
- So you're asleep...
- Right.

666
00:47:30,512 --> 00:47:33,180
- and the phone rings...
- Right.

667
00:47:33,181 --> 00:47:35,320
And it's a wrong number.

668
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,689
Why do you accept the charges on a
collect call from a wrong number?

669
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,925
I don't think I want to answer
any more questions.

670
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:46,395
And then...
you stay on the phone

671
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,964
for a minute and a half
with a wrong number.

672
00:47:48,965 --> 00:47:50,000
What the fuck do you
talk about? Area codes?

673
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,034
<i>- I want to talk to my lawyer.
- Listen, big man.</i>

674
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:54,200
We know you went down there.

675
00:47:54,201 --> 00:47:55,538
We ID'd your photo
with your neighbor,

676
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,306
who saw you get into your truck 10
minutes after the call was made.

677
00:47:58,307 --> 00:48:00,476
If you got all that, what the
fuck do you need me for, Officer?

678
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:02,477
I don't think you
understand the gravity

679
00:48:02,478 --> 00:48:05,516
of the situation here, Jimmy.

680
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:10,654
- This is a homicide.
- Lawyer.

681
00:48:11,654 --> 00:48:14,656
- You're going to sign him out?
- I called in Earl Monroe.

682
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:19,428
- The basketball player?
- Civil rights attorney.

683
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,230
- Remember Crown Heights?
- He's the best?

684
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:25,167
He's the best
above 96th Street.

685
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,539
<i>That doesn't make him
any cheaper.</i>

686
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:32,174
You got to get Jimmy
out of this.

687
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,442
Might not be that easy.

688
00:48:34,443 --> 00:48:38,680
If he doesn't cooperate, they're
likely to indict him on obstruction.

689
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:41,750
- What would he be looking at?
- Hard to say.

690
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:45,354
With his prior, five years.
Maybe 10.

691
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,494
Jesus.

692
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:54,395
Hey.

693
00:48:54,396 --> 00:48:56,706
This is not going to go away.

694
00:49:04,706 --> 00:49:08,209
Okay. I'm going to call you
tomorrow if there's any news.

695
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,678
Don't you worry
about anything here.

696
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:13,163
Don't talk to anyone else.
Take care.

697
00:49:27,163 --> 00:49:29,400
Come on. Get in.

698
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,435
All you said was you needed a fucking ride.
You didn't tell me you killed that girl.

699
00:49:34,436 --> 00:49:37,138
- Jimmy, I didn't...
- I'm trying to put my life back together.

700
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:39,606
Okay. I appreciate you helped us,
but now you're taking it too far.

701
00:49:39,607 --> 00:49:41,508
- It's going to be okay, Jimmy.
- Like it was your ass sitting there.

702
00:49:41,509 --> 00:49:43,579
<i>Like you know a fucking thing
about how it's going to be.</i>

703
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,613
We got you the best criminal
lawyer in the city.

704
00:49:45,614 --> 00:49:47,414
Don't you got
your own son for this?

705
00:49:47,415 --> 00:49:49,617
- Why the hell you didn't call him?
- Because he would have

706
00:49:49,618 --> 00:49:52,286
- fucked it up, all right?
- Okay. Well, I'm sorry your son is a fucking idiot,

707
00:49:52,287 --> 00:49:54,056
- but that ain't my fault.
- This isn't productive.

708
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,591
Oh, okay, then, Syd.

709
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:59,127
- Tell us, what happens now?
- We meet with Earl and we go from there.

710
00:49:59,128 --> 00:50:02,095
I understand right now they don't have
enough to charge you with anything.

711
00:50:02,096 --> 00:50:04,166
<i>- You're under suspicion.
- Under suspicion?</i>

712
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,669
- Motherfucker, I'm black!
- I am aware of that.

713
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:10,106
And what exactly would you
like me to do about it?

714
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:13,375
Gentlemen, my driver will take
you where you want to go,

715
00:50:13,376 --> 00:50:16,410
but I cannot be a party
to this conversation.

716
00:50:16,411 --> 00:50:18,452
So this is where I get out.

717
00:50:23,452 --> 00:50:25,822
<i>- Why couldn't you have just stayed?
- I couldn't.</i>

718
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:29,857
- Why not?
- Because I have responsibilities.

719
00:50:29,858 --> 00:50:31,626
If I stayed there, a lot of
people would have gotten hurt.

720
00:50:31,627 --> 00:50:34,763
- Well, somebody was hurt.
- Other people, Jimmy.

721
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:37,098
I got business troubles,
you understand?

722
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:38,503
People rely on me.

723
00:50:40,503 --> 00:50:42,702
Listen, I want to talk
to you a second. Come here.

724
00:50:42,703 --> 00:50:44,440
<i>I want to show you something.</i>

725
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,646
Just for a second. Come here.

726
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:54,883
- Now, you know your father asked me to look after you.
- Yeah.

727
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:59,254
Yeah. I know, I know.
I messed up. I'm sorry.

728
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:01,724
But I do want to help you.
You know that.

729
00:51:02,724 --> 00:51:06,132
<i>So I've been able to set up
a situation for you.</i>

730
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:11,165
- What's that?
- This is a trust.

731
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:14,268
In your name,
assets of $2 million.

732
00:51:14,269 --> 00:51:16,671
- Take a look at that.
- Are you serious?

733
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:18,839
You think money
is going to fix this?

734
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,813
- Huh?
- What else is there?

735
00:51:23,813 --> 00:51:27,681
- What are you doing?
- Yo, man. Pull over.

736
00:51:27,682 --> 00:51:29,621
What are you doing?

737
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:34,622
- What are you going to do?
- Do I look like a fucking snitch to you?

738
00:51:34,623 --> 00:51:37,295
I don't know, Jimmy.
I don't know. Are you?

739
00:51:39,295 --> 00:51:41,462
Wait, wait, wait. Look, sorry.

740
00:51:41,463 --> 00:51:44,665
Just read it. Just take
it home and read it.

741
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:46,942
It's not going to hurt you.

742
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,515
- Yeah?
- I've got Chris Vogler from Fremaut Accounting.

743
00:52:01,516 --> 00:52:05,453
- You asked me to interrupt you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put him through.

744
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:07,923
<i>- Chris?
- Robert, I've run into some problems.</i>

745
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:10,424
<i>- Look, we're doing a non-recommend.
- What?</i>

746
00:52:10,425 --> 00:52:13,662
<i>- They got compliance involved, I'm sorry.
- Whoa, wait, wait, wait.</i>

747
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,763
<i>- Chris? Chris? Chris!
- I've got to go.</i>

748
00:52:15,764 --> 00:52:19,239
Chris! Ch... God damn it, Chris!

749
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:26,540
Oh, Peter. Listen. I'm looking
at some statements right now.

750
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:29,944
<i>- How much did you book last quarter?
- Why?</i>

751
00:52:29,945 --> 00:52:33,714
<i>- Eh, what do you care?
- Peter, I'm really just asking you.</i>

752
00:52:33,715 --> 00:52:36,317
<i>- All right, eh, 35.
- 35 million for your whole group?</i>

753
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:38,653
<i>Yes. 35 million
for my entire group.</i>

754
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:42,524
<i>- You sure it wasn't 68?
- What? 35 million isn't a big enough number for you?</i>

755
00:52:42,525 --> 00:52:45,660
<i>- I know that it's a big number.
- Well, what the fuck are you...</i>

756
00:52:45,661 --> 00:52:48,306
<i>- No... Peter, I'll call you later.
- What do you want?</i>

757
00:52:58,306 --> 00:53:00,577
What are you doing
in my office?

758
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:02,880
Eh, hello?

759
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,948
- Can you explain these?
- Explain what?

760
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:10,454
Old Hill. All the
numbers you falsified?

761
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,891
You don't know
what you're saying.

762
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:18,593
- Get out of my way.
- Brooke.

763
00:53:18,594 --> 00:53:21,733
- You're hurting my arm.
- Can't you just leave it alone?

764
00:53:24,733 --> 00:53:27,535
- You're fired, Ben.
- You can't fire me.

765
00:53:27,536 --> 00:53:31,878
- Oh, I just did.
- Who do you think asked me to make those changes?

766
00:53:36,878 --> 00:53:38,413
You tell me.

767
00:53:38,414 --> 00:53:41,415
<i>He was doing a little dealing a while back.
Looks like he stopped.</i>

768
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:44,051
<i>- Any family?
- Eh, they're all dead.</i>

769
00:53:44,052 --> 00:53:47,455
Kid's a good student.
Magnet school. Whatever.

770
00:53:47,456 --> 00:53:50,558
Then his mom dies and he gets
popped for gun possession.

771
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,630
<i>- Even so, how come he got probation?
- He had an excellent lawyer.</i>

772
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:57,900
How the fuck could this kid
afford Felder & Chos?

773
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,768
Well, we pulled
his parents' tax returns.

774
00:54:00,769 --> 00:54:02,539
Guess where his father
worked for 20 years.

775
00:54:04,539 --> 00:54:06,674
<i>Miller Capital?</i>

776
00:54:06,675 --> 00:54:09,410
He was the fucking driver?

777
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:11,413
Oh, wow.

778
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,384
Oh, this guy's good.

779
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:18,085
- Where are you at with the kid?
- So far, he won't budge.

780
00:54:18,086 --> 00:54:19,754
Well, he's a convicted felon.

781
00:54:19,755 --> 00:54:21,589
We'll get a warrant.

782
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,792
Put him in front
of a grand jury.

783
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:25,793
<i>Let's see how long
he holds out when he realizes</i>

784
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:27,074
<i>he's looking at 10 years
off the prior.</i>

785
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:40,709
I'm sorry. Mr. Miller,
as I explained from downstairs,

786
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,776
- he's on a call right... Mr. Miller!
- Whoa.

787
00:54:42,777 --> 00:54:44,880
<i>- Robert, what the fuck...
- Tell me what is going on.</i>

788
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:47,381
- I can't.
- Tell me what the fuck is going on!

789
00:54:47,382 --> 00:54:48,818
- I can't, I can't!
- This is my life!

790
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:51,685
I know. It's not me!
Okay. The audit...

791
00:54:51,686 --> 00:54:54,689
- What?
- The audit passed. It passed a week ago, like I said.

792
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:57,625
Okay. Everything is fine. Money's confirmed.
It's all straight and done.

793
00:54:57,626 --> 00:55:00,828
- It really is.
- Why did you tell me that it didn't?

794
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:03,568
<i>- Because they asked me to hold it. Okay?
- Who's they?</i>

795
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:08,610
- Who is they?!
- Mayfield.

796
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:16,088
Mayfield.

797
00:55:26,088 --> 00:55:28,823
<i>What?</i>

798
00:55:28,824 --> 00:55:31,847
They're negotiating.
He wants a better price.

799
00:55:51,847 --> 00:55:53,580
Sherry-Netherland?

800
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:55,750
Yes. James Mayfield, please.

801
00:55:55,751 --> 00:55:58,419
Mr. Mayfield. Uh-huh.

802
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:01,122
I think it's time
we had a talk.

803
00:56:01,123 --> 00:56:03,456
- It's not going to hold.
- The warrant doesn't need to hold.

804
00:56:03,457 --> 00:56:05,527
It just needs to scare him
into giving up Miller.

805
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,694
What is it, Mike? You
stalled that big career,

806
00:56:07,695 --> 00:56:08,898
so you're reaching
for a high note?

807
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:11,098
Who gives a fuck?

808
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:13,134
This is about
Judge Rittenband, right?

809
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:15,436
- This is 'cause he's running again?
- You want to cost the judge

810
00:56:15,437 --> 00:56:16,871
his seat
on a profiling claim...

811
00:56:16,872 --> 00:56:19,207
against Earl Monroe?

812
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:21,810
I'm getting a new piece of evidence
that's going to seal it 100%.

813
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,612
Good. Bring it back
to me when you got it.

814
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:27,181
You can have it in your hand
before you go in the jury room.

815
00:56:27,182 --> 00:56:29,049
Look, Ray.

816
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,986
We like this kid.
I don't want to lose him.

817
00:56:31,987 --> 00:56:34,488
Think about it. If we flip
him, you get Robert Miller,

818
00:56:34,489 --> 00:56:37,192
and what's that worth
to Rittenband?

819
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,028
Or to you for that matter?

820
00:56:40,028 --> 00:56:42,730
20 fucking years.

821
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:46,067
Ray, 20 years we've watched these guys.
They out-lawyer us, they out-buy us.

822
00:56:46,068 --> 00:56:49,837
I'm fucking sick of it. Where's
the consequence? The guy did it.

823
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:53,040
He does not get to walk
just because he's on CNBC.

824
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:55,014
Give me the warrant.

825
00:57:00,014 --> 00:57:02,262
You better not fuck me.

826
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:17,744
Yeah. I need
a serious fucking favor.

827
00:57:28,744 --> 00:57:31,578
- Brooke's waiting for you.
- We had a meeting?

828
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:33,617
No, but she looked upset.

829
00:57:35,617 --> 00:57:37,219
<i>Sweetie, you okay?</i>

830
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:40,206
What's wrong?

831
00:57:57,206 --> 00:58:00,114
- You want to sit?
- I'll stand.

832
00:58:06,114 --> 00:58:09,917
- Didn't you think I'd find out?
- I did.

833
00:58:09,918 --> 00:58:12,221
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because I hoped you wouldn't.

834
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:15,055
Oh, come on.

835
00:58:15,056 --> 00:58:17,726
You tell me the truth
now or I am done.

836
00:58:18,726 --> 00:58:21,065
- I made a bad bet.
- No, you committed fraud.

837
00:58:23,065 --> 00:58:25,166
- That's a dangerous word.
- What would you prefer?

838
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:28,803
That you cheated?

839
00:58:28,804 --> 00:58:30,005
That you stole money
from people who trust you?

840
00:58:31,005 --> 00:58:33,774
That you lied... that you
lied right to my face?!

841
00:58:33,775 --> 00:58:37,078
- Why?
- Because we were going broke.

842
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:39,113
Everything was finished.

843
00:58:39,114 --> 00:58:41,250
- We'd have nothing.
- How? How does that happen?

844
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,817
<i>How?</i>

845
00:58:43,818 --> 00:58:46,187
<i>You remember Alexandrov?</i>

846
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:49,357
He came to see me
one day last year.

847
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:51,326
He said, "Robert,

848
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:53,127
you got a great opportunity.

849
00:58:53,128 --> 00:58:55,730
There's a copper mine in Russia.
It's under-exploited,

850
00:58:55,731 --> 00:58:57,832
there's billions
under the ground.

851
00:58:57,833 --> 00:59:00,135
To get it out, all we need
is a couple hundred million.

852
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:02,971
You put in 100,
we'll put in 100.

853
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:05,309
We'll triple it in six months."

854
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:10,278
<i>I was skeptical,
so I go check it out.</i>

855
00:59:10,279 --> 00:59:13,881
<i>Geological survey's right.
Friendly government.</i>

856
00:59:13,882 --> 00:59:18,252
And to lock it in,
you hedge it.

857
00:59:18,253 --> 00:59:21,656
Right? We sell
the copper ahead.

858
00:59:21,657 --> 00:59:24,158
Commodities exchange and it all works.
It's fine.

859
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:26,627
We're making a fortune.

860
00:59:26,628 --> 00:59:29,798
<i>And then there's something
that I hadn't accounted for.</i>

861
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:32,001
A variation margin.

862
00:59:33,001 --> 00:59:35,903
And that friendly Russian
government... not so friendly anymore.

863
00:59:35,904 --> 00:59:37,971
They're blocking
the exported copper.

864
00:59:37,972 --> 00:59:41,642
<i>So I got to pony up. I got to put
the cash in to cover the hedge.</i>

865
00:59:41,643 --> 00:59:43,409
But I'm not worried about it because
it's still springing money.

866
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:45,380
There's so much money
coming out of this ground,

867
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:48,181
you can't believe it.
You can't... you can't stop it.

868
00:59:48,182 --> 00:59:50,384
Yes. I'm the oracle.

869
00:59:50,385 --> 00:59:54,821
I have done housing. I've arb'd credit swaps.
I have done it all.

870
00:59:54,822 --> 00:59:58,058
Yes. I know
it's outside the charter,

871
00:59:58,059 --> 00:59:59,028
but it is fucking
minting money.

872
01:00:00,028 --> 01:00:02,763
It is... it's a license
to print money for everybody.

873
01:00:02,764 --> 01:00:05,836
Forever! It is God.

874
01:00:08,836 --> 01:00:12,774
- Until?
- Until it's not.

875
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:16,243
The money's trapped.
I can't get it out.

876
01:00:16,244 --> 01:00:18,680
I probably never will.

877
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,016
It's like a plane crash.
It just happens.

878
01:00:21,016 --> 01:00:23,750
<i>- It does not just happen.
- It just happened, honey.</i>

879
01:00:23,751 --> 01:00:27,721
You are so naive sometimes. You're
young, but you're not that young.

880
01:00:27,722 --> 01:00:29,691
It happens.

881
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:32,426
And like any father, I pray
that it doesn't happen to you.

882
01:00:32,427 --> 01:00:36,296
- Happily, because of me, it won't happen to you.
- Thanks to you,

883
01:00:36,297 --> 01:00:38,034
- we all may be arrested.
- No one's getting arrested.

884
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:42,403
That's why I borrowed
the money from Jeffrey.

885
01:00:42,404 --> 01:00:44,171
Plugged the hole.

886
01:00:44,172 --> 01:00:46,707
They see that
the books are fine.

887
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:50,477
Transfer the company, I pay
back Jeffrey with interest.

888
01:00:50,478 --> 01:00:54,281
I make all our investors whole
and what's left, we keep.

889
01:00:54,282 --> 01:00:56,117
<i>At least we get to keep
the house.</i>

890
01:00:56,118 --> 01:00:58,085
- Everybody wins.
- Yes.

891
01:00:58,086 --> 01:01:00,855
- If we sell the company.
- It'll sell.

892
01:01:00,856 --> 01:01:03,056
- If I lie for you.
- You don't have to lie.

893
01:01:03,057 --> 01:01:04,925
You didn't know about it.
That's why I didn't tell you.

894
01:01:04,926 --> 01:01:06,529
I'm the chief investment
officer of this company.

895
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:09,730
What do you think they're going to say
at the deposition? "She didn't know"?

896
01:01:09,731 --> 01:01:11,866
They'll take away
my brokerage license.

897
01:01:11,867 --> 01:01:13,468
Failure to supervise you.

898
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:16,404
My name in every paper and blog
while I visit your ass in jail!

899
01:01:16,405 --> 01:01:19,307
What do you want me to do? Did you
want to let our investors go bankrupt?

900
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:22,176
Is that what you wanted? You
wanted people to get really hurt?!

901
01:01:22,177 --> 01:01:24,179
- What gives you the audacity to think that you..
- You want those lives...

902
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,747
- ...can make others...
- Because it's my job!

903
01:01:26,748 --> 01:01:28,883
- Job? It's illegal.
- Yes.

904
01:01:28,884 --> 01:01:31,319
It's illegal
and I am your partner.

905
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,154
You are not my partner.
You work for me.

906
01:01:34,155 --> 01:01:36,128
That's right. You work for me.

907
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,404
Everybody works for me.

908
01:01:49,404 --> 01:01:52,105
Come here. Brooke. Please.

909
01:01:52,106 --> 01:01:55,475
Please. Come here. Just...

910
01:01:55,476 --> 01:01:57,052
just for a second. Sit down.

911
01:02:05,052 --> 01:02:07,421
<i>There's something
I want to tell you.</i>

912
01:02:07,422 --> 01:02:10,893
<i>Whatever you decide,
I won't blame you.</i>

913
01:02:11,893 --> 01:02:13,831
I'm on my own path.

914
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:18,799
It's up to you to move
with it or against it.

915
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,971
<i>But I'm the patriarch.
That's my role.</i>

916
01:02:22,971 --> 01:02:24,909
I have to play it.

917
01:02:27,909 --> 01:02:30,193
For a moment there, I thought you
were going to say you're sorry.

918
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:46,902
I'm sorry.

919
01:02:53,902 --> 01:02:55,903
Hey, Jimmy.

920
01:02:55,904 --> 01:02:58,973
- Come on, man. What?
- Take a ride with me.

921
01:02:58,974 --> 01:03:02,911
- Where? Back to the station?
- No, man. Just get in the car.

922
01:03:03,911 --> 01:03:06,613
- What if I say no?
- I'm not threatening you.

923
01:03:06,614 --> 01:03:09,862
I'm just asking you.
Take a ride with me.

924
01:03:22,463 --> 01:03:25,933
Wasting my time,
Detective. What?

925
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:28,201
Well, it's pretty
fucking simple.

926
01:03:28,202 --> 01:03:30,071
I know you went to pick him up.

927
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:32,406
So that's what you want
to talk about?

928
01:03:32,407 --> 01:03:35,509
- I told you, I ain't making no more statements.
- And I know why.

929
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:38,514
- Somebody cares?
- Here. Take a look at this.

930
01:03:39,514 --> 01:03:41,348
Take it.

931
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:43,951
I got his phone calls.
I got his text messages.

932
01:03:43,952 --> 01:03:47,087
I got his relationship
with the girl.

933
01:03:47,088 --> 01:03:49,357
They were fucking, by the way.

934
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:51,993
<i>And then I got you.</i>

935
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:54,361
I got the time log
from the pay phone.

936
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:57,098
I got a fucking
tollbooth photograph

937
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,269
of you driving your car
through the Triborough.

938
01:04:01,269 --> 01:04:03,504
Where you got that?

939
01:04:03,505 --> 01:04:07,107
That's bullshit 'cause I ain't do it.
It's impossible.

940
01:04:07,108 --> 01:04:09,643
Really?

941
01:04:09,644 --> 01:04:12,480
Look, you lied to me.

942
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:15,482
<i>You lied to the police.
You obstructed justice.</i>

943
01:04:15,483 --> 01:04:18,451
- Talk to Earl, Detective.
- Fuck Earl. You see this?

944
01:04:18,452 --> 01:04:21,355
This means that tomorrow,

945
01:04:21,356 --> 01:04:23,556
grand jury hears
your case in court.

946
01:04:23,557 --> 01:04:27,995
<i>And tomorrow in court, I'm going to ask
for a felony obstruction indictment.</i>

947
01:04:27,996 --> 01:04:31,198
With your prior, you're going
to prison for 15 fucking years.

948
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,303
You might get out in 10,
but then you'll be, what? 33?

949
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:38,376
<i>With no job. No girl. No life.</i>

950
01:04:42,376 --> 01:04:45,379
Look. I know you think
Miller's your friend.

951
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:48,716
- Who's Miller?
- I know about your father.

952
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:50,652
You don't know a goddamn
thing about my father.

953
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,955
I know that Miller paid
his bills while he was dying.

954
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:56,457
I know he got Syd Felder

955
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:58,393
to get you out of trouble
on your gun charge.

956
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,095
<i>- That doesn't add up to this.
- You done?</i>

957
01:05:01,096 --> 01:05:04,564
Okay. He's driving...

958
01:05:04,565 --> 01:05:07,067
<i>he crashes, he runs away.</i>

959
01:05:07,068 --> 01:05:09,471
Who's he call? He calls you.
Why do you think that is?

960
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,439
<i>Because you're disposable.</i>

961
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,642
You're the one person he can call
that just doesn't fucking matter.

962
01:05:14,643 --> 01:05:16,409
<i>- You're a... you're a... throwaway.
- Yeah.</i>

963
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:18,581
<i>You're just another part
of his transaction.</i>

964
01:05:20,581 --> 01:05:23,616
<i>- Will you open the door?
- So what? You're his new nigga now?</i>

965
01:05:23,617 --> 01:05:25,486
Open... open the fucking door!

966
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:27,489
I'm not fucking playin'
with you, man. Open the door.

967
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,191
You didn't kill that girl.

968
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:34,630
<i>- He did.
- Will you open the door?</i>

969
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:37,598
He's using you.

970
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,001
<i>I know it. You know it.</i>

971
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:41,634
<i>Do the right thing.</i>

972
01:05:41,635 --> 01:05:43,577
<i>Now get out of my fucking car.</i>

973
01:05:49,577 --> 01:05:52,513
<i>- What do you think?
- He's going to walk.</i>

974
01:05:52,514 --> 01:05:54,314
You're certain?

975
01:05:54,315 --> 01:05:56,250
Courts aren't for certainty,

976
01:05:56,251 --> 01:05:59,053
but he says he was at home.
Why shouldn't he be?

977
01:05:59,054 --> 01:06:01,087
Phone call
doesn't make him a liar.

978
01:06:01,088 --> 01:06:05,058
- It's not great.
- What's baffling to me, though,

979
01:06:05,059 --> 01:06:07,127
despite your sentimental
history together,

980
01:06:07,128 --> 01:06:11,237
is why you would put your family's
future in this kid's hands.

981
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:17,672
He's not like us.

982
01:06:18,672 --> 01:06:20,349
Is that a good thing?

983
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:29,585
I don't know.

984
01:06:31,585 --> 01:06:36,826
- How's Ellen?
- She's good. Fine. Same.

985
01:06:37,826 --> 01:06:40,329
- Why?
- I heard something.

986
01:06:42,329 --> 01:06:46,634
- Yes?
- She met with Gil Deustchman.

987
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:48,803
- The estate lawyer?
- Yeah.

988
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:50,507
Has she mentioned anything?

989
01:06:53,507 --> 01:06:55,519
Not to me.

990
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:07,856
<i>That was the early
morning of April 11th.</i>

991
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,658
<i>- Yes.
- You received a phone call?</i>

992
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:13,727
<i>- Yes.
- Who called you?</i>

993
01:07:13,728 --> 01:07:17,363
- It was a wrong number.
- That's a lie. Isn't it, Mr. Grant?

994
01:07:17,364 --> 01:07:19,767
No.

995
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:22,636
<i>You were on the phone
one and a half minutes.</i>

996
01:07:22,637 --> 01:07:25,239
<i>Isn't it the case you know exactly
who called you and exactly why?</i>

997
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,514
<i>- Why are you lying to this grand jury?
- I'm not lying.</i>

998
01:07:32,514 --> 01:07:35,816
I'm going to introduce
into evidence People's A.

999
01:07:35,817 --> 01:07:38,618
<i>This is a tollbooth photograph</i>

1000
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:41,788
taken in the northbound
ninth lane of Triborough...

1001
01:07:41,789 --> 01:07:44,260
excuse me, the RFK Bridge.

1002
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:50,131
Mr. Grant, directing your
attention to the photograph.

1003
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:53,399
Would you please read
the date and time stamp

1004
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,240
indicated on
the upper right-hand corner.

1005
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:03,843
- This is crazy.
- You've got to answer.

1006
01:08:03,844 --> 01:08:05,516
Mr. Grant,
please answer the question.

1007
01:08:08,516 --> 01:08:11,551
April 11th, 2:33 a.m.

1008
01:08:11,552 --> 01:08:13,822
Again, directing your attention
to the same photograph.

1009
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:16,322
Would you please read
the license plate

1010
01:08:16,323 --> 01:08:18,661
of the vehicle passing
through the toll?

1011
01:08:19,661 --> 01:08:22,595
A-O-C-8-9-6-3.

1012
01:08:22,596 --> 01:08:23,997
This is People's B.

1013
01:08:23,998 --> 01:08:28,402
A printout from the Department of
Motor Vehicles plate registry.

1014
01:08:28,403 --> 01:08:31,438
<i>Mr. Grant, directing your
attention to that printout.</i>

1015
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,573
<i>Are the numbers
on the toll photograph</i>

1016
01:08:33,574 --> 01:08:36,913
<i>the same ones that are
on your own license plate?</i>

1017
01:08:38,913 --> 01:08:41,948
<i>- Mr. Grant?
- Yes.</i>

1018
01:08:41,949 --> 01:08:44,785
<i>- Yes, the numbers are the same?
- Yes.</i>

1019
01:08:44,786 --> 01:08:46,786
- How do you explain that?
- I can't.

1020
01:08:46,787 --> 01:08:49,822
But that is...

1021
01:08:49,823 --> 01:08:52,626
your car in this photograph.
Isn't it?

1022
01:08:52,627 --> 01:08:55,667
- No.
- No, that is not your car?

1023
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,401
Answer the question, Mr. Grant.

1024
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:03,203
This is not my car
in this picture.

1025
01:09:03,204 --> 01:09:06,840
I don't know how y'all did that,
but this isn't my car.

1026
01:09:06,841 --> 01:09:09,809
<i>You expect this grand jury
to believe that,</i>

1027
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:12,247
<i>that is not your car,
when there is a printout</i>

1028
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:15,381
from the Department
of Motor Vehicles?

1029
01:09:15,382 --> 01:09:17,349
<i>- That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito.
- Mr. Monroe,</i>

1030
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:19,832
you are aware that you're not
permitted to go on record?

1031
01:09:30,832 --> 01:09:32,832
Jimmy.

1032
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:34,667
- Jimmy, Jimmy, wait.
- What?

1033
01:09:34,668 --> 01:09:36,403
- What was that?
- They're lying.

1034
01:09:36,404 --> 01:09:39,939
- Okay. Now here's...
- You can halt the decision.

1035
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:41,775
Detective,
we need a minute, please.

1036
01:09:41,776 --> 01:09:43,844
How about you, Jimmy?
You need a minute?

1037
01:09:43,845 --> 01:09:46,846
- Because if you do...
- Get the fuck out of my face. How about that?

1038
01:09:46,847 --> 01:09:48,448
So you want to keep
playing games

1039
01:09:48,449 --> 01:09:49,882
or are you ready
to tell me something?

1040
01:09:49,883 --> 01:09:51,683
<i>Detective, I need to speak
with my client.</i>

1041
01:09:51,684 --> 01:09:52,921
So now if you would
just please...

1042
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:55,555
How... how are y'all just
going to lie like that? Huh?

1043
01:09:55,556 --> 01:09:57,658
- How are y'all just gonna lie?
- We didn't lie. You lied.

1044
01:09:57,659 --> 01:10:00,260
- That wasn't my car.
- Jimmy, don't say anything else.

1045
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:01,795
Sure, it wasn't.

1046
01:10:01,796 --> 01:10:04,665
And it was a telemarketer
called you from the pay phone

1047
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:06,933
who stopped at the Chevron
to make a late-night sale.

1048
01:10:06,934 --> 01:10:09,268
- That picture was some bullshit.
- Jimmy, stop.

1049
01:10:09,269 --> 01:10:10,538
Detective, what's going on?

1050
01:10:11,538 --> 01:10:15,541
Well, tell him.
Go ahead, Jimmy. Tell him.

1051
01:10:15,542 --> 01:10:17,944
See how your boss
will like this one.

1052
01:10:21,615 --> 01:10:23,752
Last chance.

1053
01:10:24,752 --> 01:10:26,833
Wait here.

1054
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:14,568
Mr. Miller?

1055
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:16,937
I would like to introduce
you to Julie's mom.

1056
01:11:16,938 --> 01:11:18,909
Sandrine.

1057
01:11:21,909 --> 01:11:24,545
I'm so, so sorry.

1058
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:26,881
I want to thank you for everything
you did for my daughter.

1059
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:28,681
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1060
01:11:28,682 --> 01:11:31,417
You believed in her.
You gave her a chance.

1061
01:11:31,418 --> 01:11:33,390
She was happy.
I know she was happy.

1062
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:38,634
It's not fair, is it? Not fair.

1063
01:11:46,634 --> 01:11:48,983
It shouldn't have happened.

1064
01:12:01,983 --> 01:12:04,718
...rail thin. She's a blonde.

1065
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,754
I would have known who she was

1066
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:08,722
if she didn't come up and
introduce herself to me.

1067
01:12:08,723 --> 01:12:11,392
<i>She looked totally different.</i>

1068
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,131
She's living in Miami and...

1069
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:18,830
You're going straight
to level six?

1070
01:12:18,831 --> 01:12:20,935
Don't you think you better pace
yourself a little bit?

1071
01:12:21,935 --> 01:12:23,407
I'm good. I want to run.

1072
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,674
<i>Something the matter?</i>

1073
01:12:27,675 --> 01:12:30,443
<i>You and Tom all right?</i>

1074
01:12:30,444 --> 01:12:32,746
We're fine.

1075
01:12:32,747 --> 01:12:34,850
You worried about
the deal closing?

1076
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:39,555
- No.
- Do you want me to guess?

1077
01:12:40,555 --> 01:12:42,589
Come on, Brooke.
Don't be silly.

1078
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:45,559
- Tell me what's going on.
- You know, I can't stay for breakfast today.

1079
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,131
I have to just... I got to get into work.
I don't know what I was thinking.

1080
01:12:50,131 --> 01:12:53,002
Did you finish the deal
with the hospital?

1081
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:56,969
Uh, no.

1082
01:12:56,970 --> 01:13:01,442
- Did he write the check?
- No.

1083
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:05,845
- Why not?
- Issues related to the closing.

1084
01:13:05,846 --> 01:13:08,948
<i>- We don't lie to each other, Brooke.
- I'm not lying to you.</i>

1085
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:11,488
It's complicated.
You wouldn't understand.

1086
01:13:13,488 --> 01:13:15,922
You know, I know that the...

1087
01:13:15,923 --> 01:13:19,492
that the police
came to the office.

1088
01:13:19,493 --> 01:13:21,127
Do you know what that's about?

1089
01:13:21,128 --> 01:13:25,232
- I honestly have no idea.
- How about your father's head?

1090
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:27,233
Where he cut his head

1091
01:13:27,234 --> 01:13:29,136
and the pain that he's
hiding in his stomach

1092
01:13:29,137 --> 01:13:31,971
and the fact
that he hasn't slept?

1093
01:13:31,972 --> 01:13:33,007
And now, for some reason,

1094
01:13:34,007 --> 01:13:38,178
it's way too complicated
for me to understand?

1095
01:13:38,179 --> 01:13:42,081
There's no money
for a routine gift?

1096
01:13:42,082 --> 01:13:43,951
Does that seem
a little strange?

1097
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:47,120
- Of course it's strange.
- So tell me what's happening.

1098
01:13:47,121 --> 01:13:49,956
What do you want me to say?

1099
01:13:49,957 --> 01:13:52,693
He's my dad.

1100
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:54,065
- I have to trust him.
- No.

1101
01:13:58,065 --> 01:14:00,099
You have to do
what's right for you.

1102
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,769
Not him. Not me. Not anyone.

1103
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:06,914
This is your life.

1104
01:14:13,914 --> 01:14:16,738
I love you. I've got to go.

1105
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:39,605
Mr. Mayfield.

1106
01:14:39,606 --> 01:14:41,908
You keep sending people
to my office

1107
01:14:41,909 --> 01:14:45,144
- to do business.
- They're just getting acquainted.

1108
01:14:45,145 --> 01:14:47,915
Yeah. The intricacies
of my operation,

1109
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:50,250
so that you cannot buy it?

1110
01:14:50,251 --> 01:14:52,085
Just coffee, thanks.

1111
01:14:52,086 --> 01:14:53,988
You remember what it was like
on our side of the fence.

1112
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,857
Everything just moves
a little slower.

1113
01:14:56,858 --> 01:15:00,294
Plus, this whole audit mess doesn't help.
You know, clearing that all up.

1114
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:02,295
- Fuck you.
- Excuse me?

1115
01:15:02,296 --> 01:15:05,165
Fuck you. I am the oracle
of Gracie Square.

1116
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:07,200
You came to me.
I did not come to you.

1117
01:15:07,201 --> 01:15:09,837
- Robert, I think we're getting off on the wrong foot.
- No, no, no. Forget it.

1118
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:12,339
Forget the deal. I don't
even care about the deal.

1119
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:14,907
No, I run a very comfortable...
no, excuse me.

1120
01:15:14,908 --> 01:15:17,611
I run a thriving business.

1121
01:15:17,612 --> 01:15:20,613
It has returned,
year to date, 15.4%.

1122
01:15:20,614 --> 01:15:23,716
Approximately $583 million
from an operation

1123
01:15:23,717 --> 01:15:26,086
that you don't have
and we both know you need.

1124
01:15:26,087 --> 01:15:28,154
Which is why you called me
in the first place.

1125
01:15:28,155 --> 01:15:30,756
You, on the other hand,
you take a salary

1126
01:15:30,757 --> 01:15:33,859
of $18 million.

1127
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:35,329
And what are you doing with it?

1128
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:38,130
Falling stock price...
no, negative 16?

1129
01:15:38,131 --> 01:15:39,399
Is that what it is?

1130
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:43,836
You've also lost approximately
3.5 billion to your investors.

1131
01:15:43,837 --> 01:15:45,338
Tell me, why the fuck
do I need you?

1132
01:15:45,339 --> 01:15:47,108
- Let's just calm down.
- You know what we're gonna do?

1133
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:49,910
We're gonna put out a press
release. Immediately. Today.

1134
01:15:49,911 --> 01:15:52,612
We're gonna say there's no deal.
There never was a deal.

1135
01:15:52,613 --> 01:15:54,880
You're not going to be
buying Old Hill.

1136
01:15:54,881 --> 01:15:56,616
You're not going to be
buying Quantum.

1137
01:15:56,617 --> 01:15:57,918
You're not going to be
buying anything.

1138
01:15:57,919 --> 01:16:01,755
You? You're just a browser.

1139
01:16:01,756 --> 01:16:05,091
Me? I'm going to continue
to enjoy my earnings.

1140
01:16:05,092 --> 01:16:09,196
And while I soar
on princely wings

1141
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:12,799
to my next winning enterprise,

1142
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,269
your shares are going to drop
another couple of bucks based on

1143
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:18,738
a failed acquisition attempt.

1144
01:16:18,739 --> 01:16:21,710
Bodes well for your tenure,
doesn't it?

1145
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:24,015
Your price is too high.

1146
01:16:28,015 --> 01:16:30,716
You have a nice day, James.

1147
01:16:30,717 --> 01:16:33,086
<i>400.</i>

1148
01:16:33,087 --> 01:16:35,356
- 550.
- 450.

1149
01:16:36,356 --> 01:16:37,856
525. That's it. Yes or no.

1150
01:16:38,025 --> 01:16:42,429
And if it's no, that's any
further communications

1151
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:44,068
- goes right into my trash can.
- It's a deal.

1152
01:16:47,068 --> 01:16:48,774
One other thing.

1153
01:16:53,774 --> 01:16:56,443
Six months, I'm going to be gone.
I'm out of here.

1154
01:16:56,444 --> 01:16:58,179
My daughter's
going to take it over.

1155
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,880
You know her, you trust her.

1156
01:17:00,881 --> 01:17:04,283
- All right.
- And you're going to have to make my son a VP.

1157
01:17:04,284 --> 01:17:06,853
- Robert.
- No, no. He doesn't have to do anything.

1158
01:17:06,854 --> 01:17:09,889
He just gets a salary.
He gets the office.

1159
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:13,426
Five-year employment contract
for both of them.

1160
01:17:13,427 --> 01:17:15,230
My lawyers draft them.
Yes or no?

1161
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:19,109
- Yes.
- Okay.

1162
01:17:28,109 --> 01:17:31,344
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing the deal.

1163
01:17:31,345 --> 01:17:34,051
- You're not serious.
- Yeah. I'm serious. Very serious.

1164
01:17:37,051 --> 01:17:38,059
Sign it.

1165
01:17:45,059 --> 01:17:47,364
I'll send over a draft
of the press release.

1166
01:17:51,364 --> 01:17:53,032
You all right?

1167
01:17:53,033 --> 01:17:54,104
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

1168
01:17:56,104 --> 01:18:01,110
Before I leave,
what would you have paid?

1169
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:05,814
600. And you would have taken?

1170
01:18:07,814 --> 01:18:10,183
475.

1171
01:18:10,184 --> 01:18:12,059
- So we made a good deal.
- Yeah.

1172
01:18:18,059 --> 01:18:21,802
Actually, I lied.
I would have taken 400.

1173
01:18:28,802 --> 01:18:30,971
<i>Anyway, I will
be seeing most of you</i>

1174
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:33,038
<i>at the gala tomorrow night.</i>

1175
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:34,974
Since the sale is official,

1176
01:18:34,975 --> 01:18:37,043
as of this afternoon, you're
free to talk about it now.

1177
01:18:37,044 --> 01:18:40,045
- More questions?
- Will we get new business cards?

1178
01:18:40,046 --> 01:18:42,482
Yes. Everyone but you.

1179
01:18:42,483 --> 01:18:44,785
All right. Thank you
all very, very much.

1180
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:47,453
You're going to be proud
of this. It's a good day.

1181
01:18:47,454 --> 01:18:49,089
Your hard work made it happen.

1182
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:50,859
Thank you all. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1183
01:18:51,859 --> 01:18:53,394
So how did you get Mayfield
to come around?

1184
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,795
I met his price.
Took it out of your share.

1185
01:18:55,796 --> 01:18:57,563
- Hey, Robert?
- Yeah?

1186
01:18:57,564 --> 01:19:01,067
- Nice job.
- Well, thank you.

1187
01:19:01,068 --> 01:19:03,870
Now go get me that fucking
hospital check.

1188
01:19:07,507 --> 01:19:10,387
<i>- Yeah?
- It's not good.</i>

1189
01:19:40,574 --> 01:19:42,452
Hello.

1190
01:19:51,452 --> 01:19:53,420
You want something to drink?

1191
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:55,589
- What do you got?
- Not much.

1192
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:57,624
- Got any milk?
- Nope.

1193
01:19:57,625 --> 01:19:59,231
I'll take a water.

1194
01:20:04,231 --> 01:20:06,966
<i>- Where are you going?
- What?</i>

1195
01:20:06,967 --> 01:20:11,506
- Boxes.
- Was planning on Virginia.

1196
01:20:12,506 --> 01:20:14,948
Looks like
I'm not going anymore.

1197
01:20:20,948 --> 01:20:22,617
What? You waiting on me
to say something?

1198
01:20:22,618 --> 01:20:26,452
- I told you not to take the toll.
- Yeah, you did.

1199
01:20:26,453 --> 01:20:28,388
I said listen carefully.

1200
01:20:28,389 --> 01:20:31,892
Follow my directions. Do
exactly what I tell you to do.

1201
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:33,491
- You said all that.
- But you took the toll anyway.

1202
01:20:33,492 --> 01:20:35,328
- No, I did not.
- Don't fucking lie to me.

1203
01:20:35,329 --> 01:20:38,264
I'm not lying. I took 95
the whole goddamn way there.

1204
01:20:38,265 --> 01:20:40,432
I did what you said. I didn't stop.
I didn't take the Triborough.

1205
01:20:40,433 --> 01:20:41,799
I followed all
your fucking instructions.

1206
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,204
- Then where did they get the photograph from?
- You tell me.

1207
01:20:44,205 --> 01:20:48,073
- You're saying it's a fake?
- How did you get so fucking rich again?

1208
01:20:48,074 --> 01:20:50,644
- Don't be such a wise-ass.
- This is my fucking life, man.

1209
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:54,480
Earl's telling me it could be
10 years! 10 fucking years!

1210
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:57,517
How much is
10 years worth, Robert?

1211
01:20:57,518 --> 01:20:59,619
<i>Look, man. I told you,
I ain't no fucking snitch.</i>

1212
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:02,988
But this is bad.
This is real bad.

1213
01:21:02,989 --> 01:21:04,523
Me and Reina got a whole plan

1214
01:21:04,524 --> 01:21:06,226
<i>we about to make
happen next week.</i>

1215
01:21:06,227 --> 01:21:08,428
- What plan?
- I got money saved up.

1216
01:21:08,429 --> 01:21:10,533
Buying a business.

1217
01:21:12,533 --> 01:21:14,600
- What business?
- I bought an Applebee's.

1218
01:21:14,601 --> 01:21:18,237
- What's an Applebee's?
- It's a fucking restaurant.

1219
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:22,207
- It's a chain restaurant.
- You bought an Applebee's in Virginia?

1220
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:24,978
Is this really what you
came here to talk about?

1221
01:21:24,979 --> 01:21:29,416
- What are you gonna do?
- It's not really that simple, Jimmy.

1222
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:32,652
- I'm in a situation now.
- What situation?

1223
01:21:32,653 --> 01:21:35,154
I told you. Right now,

1224
01:21:35,155 --> 01:21:37,390
if I were to speak, a lot
of people would get hurt.

1225
01:21:37,391 --> 01:21:39,526
Jobs. Families.

1226
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:42,161
<i>A lot of innocent people. Do you
think you can understand that?</i>

1227
01:21:42,162 --> 01:21:46,599
Yeah, but what about me?
What about my situation?

1228
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,301
They showed me the pictures.
That's fucked up what you did.

1229
01:21:49,302 --> 01:21:52,204
- And I know all the people counting on you. Whatever.
- It was an accident.

1230
01:21:52,205 --> 01:21:54,143
But you told me Earl
was gonna make this right.

1231
01:21:56,143 --> 01:21:58,045
<i>Robert, you know
I care about you.</i>

1232
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:02,415
All the things you did
for us and for my father.

1233
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:05,184
But Earl said
they'll offer me a deal.

1234
01:22:05,185 --> 01:22:07,521
<i>No charges at all. I walk away.</i>

1235
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:11,758
They just want to know
who I went to pick up.

1236
01:22:11,759 --> 01:22:14,626
Why are you putting me
in this situation, man?

1237
01:22:14,627 --> 01:22:16,233
Why are you putting me
in this position?

1238
01:22:19,233 --> 01:22:21,367
Can you just hang tight?

1239
01:22:21,368 --> 01:22:24,373
Can you do that?
Just a little longer.

1240
01:22:26,373 --> 01:22:28,241
All right,

1241
01:22:28,242 --> 01:22:30,777
but Earl said the deal
is on the table for 24 hours.

1242
01:22:30,778 --> 01:22:34,181
<i>After that,
they're going to file a case.</i>

1243
01:22:35,181 --> 01:22:36,020
Earl says we're going to lose.

1244
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:41,490
All right.

1245
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:45,773
Just hang with me a little bit.

1246
01:22:58,773 --> 01:23:01,107
You got to give him up.

1247
01:23:01,108 --> 01:23:03,309
You said take the money.

1248
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:06,082
Yeah. That was to keep quiet,
not to go away.

1249
01:23:08,082 --> 01:23:09,652
<i>What's he offering you now?</i>

1250
01:23:11,652 --> 01:23:13,640
What can he offer me?

1251
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,507
<i>We went to the toll authority</i>

1252
01:23:35,508 --> 01:23:37,778
<i>and they said they gave
the tape to the cops.</i>

1253
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:41,613
<i>I requested our investigator go
examine it at the evidence room,</i>

1254
01:23:41,614 --> 01:23:43,649
<i>but honestly, what's the point?</i>

1255
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:47,460
<i>- He says he didn't take the toll.
- And you believe him?</i>

1256
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:56,728
<i>- Does Standard have claw-back?
- What? What do you mean?</i>

1257
01:23:56,729 --> 01:23:59,532
<i>- Let's just say I decide to go in.
- Have you lost your mind?</i>

1258
01:23:59,533 --> 01:24:01,137
Wait a minute.
Just listen. Listen to me.

1259
01:24:04,137 --> 01:24:06,706
If I were to surrender now...

1260
01:24:06,707 --> 01:24:10,309
<i>- could they roll back the deal?
- No. What's done is done.</i>

1261
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:14,279
<i>There's no intention of fraud, you
haven't warranted any behavior.</i>

1262
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,383
<i>- So it's just money.
- Four years, you think?</i>

1263
01:24:17,384 --> 01:24:19,251
<i>I don't know.</i>

1264
01:24:19,252 --> 01:24:23,255
<i>At this point, they're not
going to make it easy.</i>

1265
01:24:23,256 --> 01:24:27,794
<i>I really suggest
you think about this.</i>

1266
01:24:27,795 --> 01:24:30,568
Call the D.A. Get it started.

1267
01:24:34,568 --> 01:24:37,840
<i>Yeah, Glen. Mrs. Miller
say where she was going tonight?</i>

1268
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,854
Ah. No, I'll try her
her cell. Thank you.

1269
01:24:56,923 --> 01:24:59,434
<i>Hi, this is Ellen Miller.
I'm not available right now.</i>

1270
01:25:24,585 --> 01:25:28,554
Syd? Yeah, yeah. Did you make
that call to the D.A. yet?

1271
01:25:28,555 --> 01:25:31,523
Thank God. No, no, no, no, no.

1272
01:25:31,524 --> 01:25:33,626
Listen to me. Call Earl.

1273
01:25:33,627 --> 01:25:35,428
<i>Tell him to get his car.</i>

1274
01:25:35,429 --> 01:25:38,965
<i>Tell him to meet us over here
at my house in 20 minutes.</i>

1275
01:25:38,966 --> 01:25:42,801
<i>Yeah, and Syd? Bring a notary.</i>

1276
01:25:42,802 --> 01:25:44,712
I'm going to need
a receipt, please.

1277
01:25:51,712 --> 01:25:53,840
Thank you.
You have a good night now.

1278
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,442
Hi. I'm Brent Owens. Night Supervisor.
How can I help you?

1279
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:24,277
Hello, Brent. I'm Earl Monroe.

1280
01:26:24,278 --> 01:26:26,446
I'm issuing
a criminal evidence request.

1281
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:29,749
I'm going to need to have a
look at one of your lane tapes.

1282
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:32,417
I don't understand.
This says you want to look

1283
01:26:32,418 --> 01:26:34,418
at a tape that was made
ten minutes ago?

1284
01:26:40,027 --> 01:26:42,400
Wait, wait. Just wait.

1285
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:55,642
Okay. They won't release
tape without a court order,

1286
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:57,977
<i>but they did give me
a printout.</i>

1287
01:26:57,978 --> 01:27:01,813
The same kind they used
at Jimmy's indictment.

1288
01:27:01,814 --> 01:27:03,950
- Your car? With plates.
- Yes.

1289
01:27:03,951 --> 01:27:05,587
Okay. You got Jimmy's?

1290
01:27:07,587 --> 01:27:09,623
Thanks.

1291
01:27:43,623 --> 01:27:45,728
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

1292
01:27:47,728 --> 01:27:49,496
<i>They look a little
different to me, too.</i>

1293
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:51,730
Is there a reason
why you haven't allowed

1294
01:27:51,731 --> 01:27:54,066
Mr. Monroe's investigator
to conduct his own analysis?

1295
01:27:54,067 --> 01:27:55,802
We've had some issues
regarding chain of custody.

1296
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:57,937
Now you don't
have them anymore.

1297
01:27:57,938 --> 01:28:00,439
You're to meet with him, with
the evidence, in the next hour.

1298
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,377
I'm afraid that's not possible.

1299
01:28:03,377 --> 01:28:05,577
Where is the tape?

1300
01:28:05,578 --> 01:28:07,079
<i>Am I not speaking loud enough?</i>

1301
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:08,546
<i>- Your Honor?
- Yes?</i>

1302
01:28:08,547 --> 01:28:10,086
- There seems to be...
- Let him tell me.

1303
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:15,822
- We don't know where it is.
- Come again?

1304
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:19,425
- It's not in the evidence locker.
- Where is it?

1305
01:28:19,426 --> 01:28:22,862
- We don't know.
- I'll ask you one more time, Detective.

1306
01:28:22,863 --> 01:28:25,502
Where is the tape?

1307
01:28:28,502 --> 01:28:31,108
<i>- We lost it.
- Mm.</i>

1308
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:35,009
In light of these developments...

1309
01:28:36,009 --> 01:28:37,845
and I would think you should be
very happy to hear this.

1310
01:28:37,846 --> 01:28:40,947
With Mr. Monroe's approval, I'm
going to offer Mr. Deferlito

1311
01:28:40,948 --> 01:28:44,050
<i>the opportunity to voluntarily
dismiss the indictment</i>

1312
01:28:44,051 --> 01:28:46,118
<i>to save us all a bunch
of embarrassment.</i>

1313
01:28:46,119 --> 01:28:48,988
- I don't feel comfortable with that, Your Honor.
- Further, I'm going to put

1314
01:28:48,989 --> 01:28:51,556
all charges against
Mr. Grant under seal.

1315
01:28:51,557 --> 01:28:54,426
This case is dismissed with
prejudice and not to be refiled.

1316
01:28:54,427 --> 01:28:56,929
<i>Hold on, Detective.</i>

1317
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:59,898
<i>If you have another suspect
in the automobile death,</i>

1318
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:03,836
then you are to present him.

1319
01:29:03,837 --> 01:29:06,006
But Mr. Grant is free
from any further inquiry.

1320
01:29:07,006 --> 01:29:10,881
<i>- This is over. Do I have your understanding?
- Thank you.</i>

1321
01:29:14,881 --> 01:29:17,591
Close the door,
Detective. Please.

1322
01:29:24,591 --> 01:29:26,858
You finessed this. Didn't you?

1323
01:29:26,859 --> 01:29:30,429
- I'm sorry?
- You finessed it.

1324
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:32,431
I know it and you know it.

1325
01:29:32,432 --> 01:29:34,099
<i>I know who you're after.</i>

1326
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:36,702
<i>I saw all the evidence.
Not just a toll photo.</i>

1327
01:29:36,703 --> 01:29:40,707
- You got to get him the right way.
- Oh.

1328
01:29:41,707 --> 01:29:42,612
Okay.

1329
01:29:45,612 --> 01:29:48,147
So let me get this straight.

1330
01:29:48,148 --> 01:29:50,751
What you're telling me is I'm supposed
to sit around with my thumb up my ass

1331
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:53,685
and my fingers crossed,
hoping that one of these

1332
01:29:53,686 --> 01:29:55,189
fucking days,
somewhere down the line,

1333
01:29:55,190 --> 01:29:57,989
one of these rich assholes

1334
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:01,059
is gonna say the wrong thing
loud enough

1335
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:03,600
so that we can't choose
to ignore him anymore?

1336
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,604
Get the fuck out of my office.

1337
01:30:10,604 --> 01:30:13,975
Yes, Your Honor.

1338
01:30:14,975 --> 01:30:18,176
- Well, when do you expect her?
- Hey.

1339
01:30:18,177 --> 01:30:21,246
- When do you expect her?
- What's going on?

1340
01:30:21,247 --> 01:30:23,616
So I don't have
to call you a ninth time,

1341
01:30:23,617 --> 01:30:25,185
can you take down
what I'm saying?

1342
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:27,953
Word for word. Exactly.

1343
01:30:27,954 --> 01:30:29,956
Okay. You got a pencil?

1344
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:32,191
All right. Are you ready?

1345
01:30:32,192 --> 01:30:34,126
Okay. Here goes.

1346
01:30:34,127 --> 01:30:35,894
Mrs. Miller,

1347
01:30:35,895 --> 01:30:39,002
exactly how fucking stupid
do you really think I am?

1348
01:30:43,002 --> 01:30:45,571
He didn't hurt anybody.

1349
01:30:45,572 --> 01:30:47,739
He helped a lot of people.

1350
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:50,613
- This piece of paper makes everything okay?
- No.

1351
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:55,547
It makes it easier.

1352
01:30:55,548 --> 01:30:57,118
You heard him say something.

1353
01:30:59,118 --> 01:31:00,622
No.

1354
01:31:02,622 --> 01:31:06,725
Robert, look. You asked me to
come meet you and I'm here.

1355
01:31:06,726 --> 01:31:10,630
But I came because I want to get
something straight between us.

1356
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:12,600
We're even.

1357
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:17,903
Okay. We're even.

1358
01:31:17,904 --> 01:31:21,107
Just for the record, though,

1359
01:31:21,108 --> 01:31:23,276
what you did,

1360
01:31:23,277 --> 01:31:25,877
way beyond the money.

1361
01:31:25,878 --> 01:31:28,648
Nothing beyond money for you, Robert.
We both know that.

1362
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:32,087
- Thanks a lot.
- If I take this...

1363
01:31:34,087 --> 01:31:36,127
what does that say about me?

1364
01:31:40,127 --> 01:31:43,129
Fuck it. I'm going
to take your money.

1365
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:45,877
I'm going to do
something good with it.

1366
01:31:57,877 --> 01:31:59,181
Hey, sweetie.

1367
01:32:02,181 --> 01:32:04,282
What time do you
want to get there?

1368
01:32:04,283 --> 01:32:06,722
<i>I don't want
to get there too soon.</i>

1369
01:32:09,722 --> 01:32:12,927
<i>How late do you
think it will go?</i>

1370
01:32:14,927 --> 01:32:17,699
You okay? What is it?

1371
01:32:19,699 --> 01:32:23,234
- You spoke to Brooke?
- She told you that?

1372
01:32:23,235 --> 01:32:27,842
No, she didn't have to.

1373
01:32:29,842 --> 01:32:33,245
- Yeah, I explained to Brooke...
- You explained?

1374
01:32:33,246 --> 01:32:37,849
- Did you tell her everything?
- Yeah. Yes.

1375
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:39,890
Everything?

1376
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:47,059
- Lift up your shirt.
- What?

1377
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:49,702
<i>Lift up your shirt.</i>

1378
01:32:55,702 --> 01:32:57,947
Did you tell her about this?

1379
01:33:06,947 --> 01:33:09,914
- Ellen, I don't know what you think you know.
- Don't treat me like an idiot.

1380
01:33:09,915 --> 01:33:12,351
You've been sneaking off to see her for months.
You don't think I know?

1381
01:33:12,352 --> 01:33:16,889
- What do you think you know?
- I never cared, really, about your secretaries,

1382
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:19,791
<i>your gallerists, your whores,
whatever you want to call them.</i>

1383
01:33:19,792 --> 01:33:21,794
<i>I cared about our home.</i>

1384
01:33:21,795 --> 01:33:25,864
- Now you brought this to our door.
- I did what was necessary.

1385
01:33:25,865 --> 01:33:27,900
No, you did what was necessary for
you, Robert, for your interests.

1386
01:33:27,901 --> 01:33:29,434
<i>- For my interests?
- Yes.</i>

1387
01:33:29,435 --> 01:33:32,438
Everything I do is for us.
For this family.

1388
01:33:32,439 --> 01:33:35,808
- Now you're telling me how to run my business?
- This isn't about business!

1389
01:33:35,809 --> 01:33:38,244
This is our life! Where do you
think we're going tonight?

1390
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:40,979
What do you think I've tolerated
all of this for so long?

1391
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:44,050
You tolerated? Wow.

1392
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,918
- I'm glad you find that funny.
- What about me?

1393
01:33:45,919 --> 01:33:48,153
What about me?
What about the complaints?

1394
01:33:48,154 --> 01:33:50,922
The unhappiness? The drinking?

1395
01:33:50,923 --> 01:33:54,393
The shopping?
The trainers? Everything!

1396
01:33:54,394 --> 01:33:57,862
But, yes, the charities. The
wonderful, sainted charities.

1397
01:33:57,863 --> 01:34:00,800
You know, all the wonderful
things that you do.

1398
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:02,468
How do you think
I pay for them?

1399
01:34:02,469 --> 01:34:06,171
I didn't ask you because
I didn't want you to lie.

1400
01:34:06,172 --> 01:34:07,007
- Because you didn't want to give them up.
- I thought that we

1401
01:34:08,007 --> 01:34:11,443
had an understanding, and you
broke that understanding

1402
01:34:11,444 --> 01:34:13,144
when you brought
Brooke into it.

1403
01:34:13,145 --> 01:34:16,181
- No, I kept her out.
- When you made Brooke complicit.

1404
01:34:16,182 --> 01:34:19,787
- When you risked her future, and I'm done.
- I kept her out.

1405
01:34:20,787 --> 01:34:22,011
- What is this?
- Read it.

1406
01:34:46,011 --> 01:34:48,147
All ownership
and voting rights transfer

1407
01:34:48,148 --> 01:34:50,048
to the Miller Charitable
Foundation

1408
01:34:50,049 --> 01:34:51,287
to be administered
by Brooke Miller.

1409
01:34:54,287 --> 01:34:57,857
- You really expect me to sign this thing?
- You're not following.

1410
01:34:57,858 --> 01:35:01,160
- Apparently not. No, no.
- Okay.

1411
01:35:01,161 --> 01:35:04,964
Um, the police have been
trying to talk to me.

1412
01:35:04,965 --> 01:35:08,399
I assume because they want to
know where you were that night.

1413
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,769
I'm not going to lie for you.

1414
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:13,938
- Not unless you sign that.
- Yeah.

1415
01:35:13,939 --> 01:35:15,840
This leaves me with nothing.

1416
01:35:15,841 --> 01:35:17,144
I think you'll
find a way to manage.

1417
01:35:17,145 --> 01:35:21,147
I'm sure you have all kinds of
things offshore for a rainy day.

1418
01:35:21,148 --> 01:35:24,018
- This is fucking crazy.
- If you sign it, then I will tell your lie.

1419
01:35:25,018 --> 01:35:30,523
I will say that I was with you
that night. All night, here.

1420
01:35:30,524 --> 01:35:34,160
<i>And you will be free and clear.</i>

1421
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:37,565
And the people that need our money will get it.
That's my price.

1422
01:35:39,565 --> 01:35:41,467
You are out of your mind.
I am not signing this.

1423
01:35:41,468 --> 01:35:43,005
I will not sign that!

1424
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:47,505
Well, then,
I will have to tell them

1425
01:35:47,506 --> 01:35:50,442
that you came home at 4:30...

1426
01:35:50,443 --> 01:35:52,212
- bruised and bleeding.
- Why would you tell them?

1427
01:35:52,213 --> 01:35:54,015
That's fucking ridiculous.
What...

1428
01:35:56,015 --> 01:35:59,451
- You trying to blackmail me?
- I think we call it negotiating.

1429
01:35:59,452 --> 01:36:02,188
You're not going to win that one.
There's no fucking way.

1430
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:03,989
Then you know what? It will
cause just enough trouble,

1431
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:06,125
the kind of trouble
that you don't want.

1432
01:36:06,126 --> 01:36:09,060
- Apparently, according to my lawyer, it's enough...
- Fucking lawyer...

1433
01:36:09,061 --> 01:36:10,030
- ...to give them probable cause.
- Fuck!

1434
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:15,334
- Then they can subpoena your DNA and your cell phone and...
- Fuck the DNA!

1435
01:36:15,335 --> 01:36:18,104
- I'm sick of this shit!
- So, really, Robert. What you have is a choice.

1436
01:36:18,105 --> 01:36:21,072
You can either be in court and the
tabloids for the next three years,

1437
01:36:21,073 --> 01:36:23,142
or you can be at your business.

1438
01:36:23,143 --> 01:36:25,215
You won't do this.
You won't do it.

1439
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:32,425
- You wouldn't do it to the kids.
- Just try me.

1440
01:36:38,425 --> 01:36:41,327
You broke

1441
01:36:41,328 --> 01:36:43,367
our little girl's heart.

1442
01:36:47,367 --> 01:36:50,269
It's how it all works, Ellen.

1443
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:52,103
- You know that.
- I know.

1444
01:36:52,104 --> 01:36:55,377
- But she didn't.
- She'll be better for it.

1445
01:36:57,377 --> 01:37:00,511
The world is cold.

1446
01:37:00,512 --> 01:37:02,020
Then you're going
to need a warm coat.

1447
01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:24,470
There's one more thing.
I hate to mention it now...

1448
01:37:24,471 --> 01:37:28,311
- but I just received it.
- Speak, John.

1449
01:37:32,311 --> 01:37:36,482
I had Stern Marling do a secondary
audit on the Miller financials.

1450
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:40,563
<i>- Who authorized this?
- I did.</i>

1451
01:37:50,563 --> 01:37:53,000
What did you conclude?
It's in front of you.

1452
01:37:56,101 --> 01:37:57,569
I didn't ask you
what the paper said, John.

1453
01:37:57,570 --> 01:37:59,206
I asked you what you thought.

1454
01:38:00,206 --> 01:38:02,407
What do you think?

1455
01:38:02,408 --> 01:38:05,077
I think...

1456
01:38:05,078 --> 01:38:07,257
I think I don't see
anything wrong here.

1457
01:38:52,257 --> 01:38:54,661
<i>And to receive
this prestigious award...</i>

1458
01:38:54,662 --> 01:38:56,495
<i>I invite now to the stage</i>

1459
01:38:56,496 --> 01:38:59,364
<i>the man who led
this generous effort</i>

1460
01:38:59,365 --> 01:39:02,634
<i>and whose financial
trading firm, Miller Capital,</i>

1461
01:39:02,635 --> 01:39:06,673
<i>was just this morning acquired
by Standard Bank & Trust.</i>

1462
01:39:07,673 --> 01:39:11,777
<i>A dedicated businessman,
a family man,</i>

1463
01:39:11,778 --> 01:39:15,147
<i>philanthropist,</i>

1464
01:39:15,148 --> 01:39:17,284
and all-around humanitarian.

1465
01:39:19,284 --> 01:39:21,754
A man I am very lucky to call

1466
01:39:21,755 --> 01:39:25,491
my mentor, my friend,

1467
01:39:25,492 --> 01:39:28,660
