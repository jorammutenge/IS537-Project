00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,879
<i>I read this article</i>
<i>a while back...</i>

3
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:59,857
<i>that said Microsoft employs more</i>
<i>millionaire secretaries...</i>

4
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,326
<i>than any other company</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

5
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,728
<i>They took stock options</i>
<i>over Christmas bonuses.</i>

6
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,994
<i>It was a good move.</i>

7
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,559
<i>I remember there was this photograph</i>
<i>of one of the groundskeepers...</i>

8
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,832
<i>next to his Ferrari.</i>

9
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,931
<i>Blew my mind.</i>

10
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,000
<i>You see shit like that,</i>
<i>and it just plants seeds...</i>

11
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,603
<i>makes you think it's possible,</i>
<i>even easy.</i>

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,808
<i>And then you turn on the TV,</i>
<i>and there's just more of it.</i>

13
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,408
<i>The $87 million dollar</i>
<i>lottery winner.</i>

14
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,614
<i>That kid actor that just made</i>
<i>20 million on his last movie.</i>

15
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,214
<i>That Internet stock that</i>
<i>shot through the roof.</i>

16
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,420
<i>You could've made millions on it</i>
<i>if you'd just got in early.</i>

17
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:39,625
<i>And that's exactly</i>
<i>what I wanted to do... get in.</i>

18
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:44,068
<i>I didn't want to be an innovator. I just</i>
<i>wanted to make the quick, easy buck.</i>

19
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,469
<i>I just wanted in.</i>

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,938
<i>Notorious B.I.G.</i>
<i>Said it best...</i>

21
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,410
<i>"Either you're slinging crack rock,</i>
<i>or you got a wicked jump shot. "

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,846
<i>Nobody wants to work</i>
<i>for it anymore.</i>

23
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,544
<i>There's no honor in taking</i>
<i>that after-school job at Mickey D's.</i>

24
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,486
<i>Honor's in the dollar, kid.</i>

25
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,615
<i>So I went the white-boy way</i>
<i>of slinging crack rock.</i>

26
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,353
<i>I became a stockbroker.</i>

27
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,668
- Get off!
- Two hundred!

28
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,570
Put your money back down!
Yo! Put your money back down!

29
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:45,092
<i>So I got in at this firm,</i>
<i>J. T. Marlin...</i>

30
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,100
<i>owned by</i>
<i>this guy Michael Brantley...</i>

31
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,500
<i>a salesman among salesmen.</i>

32
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,505
Mr. Brantley!

33
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:57,339
- Mr. Brantley! Welcome! How are you?
- How you gonna handle these guys?

34
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,901
- They're great.
- You think you can handle this or what?

35
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,914
- I think so. We can handle it.
- You can handle it?

36
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,257
A double scotch on the rocks.

37
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,463
Holy shit, yo.
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

38
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,835
That's the jockey from Venezuela.
He's a sicko. He weighs like 48 pounds.

39
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,670
119, but you're close, slut.

40
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,903
Whatever. Give me three-to-one
on that skinny little nigger.

41
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:36,210
Richie, Richie.
Do me a favor, will you?

42
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,716
Just for, like, ten minutes.
Just give it a rest.

43
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:43,119
Yo, homes, I need some "chocaine."
I need some motherfuckin' nose candy.

44
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,248
I need some cizzi up my nizzi...

45
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,316
'cause I need to get high
like a motherfucker.

46
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,453
Know what I'm sayin'?
So give me some of that nose candy.

47
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,862
Bring that table over here.

48
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:57,198
Everybody quiet down for a second.
All right. Hold on.

49
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,469
Thanks. I wanted to let you know those
pikers at the N.A.S.D. Are off our ass.

50
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:09,581
- Fuckin' retard.
- Fuck you. I'm on vacation.

51
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:13,278
Bear Stearns can call the S.E.C.
They can't find any dirt on us.

52
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,789
J.T. Marlin, once again,
has unlimited trading authorization.

53
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,620
I told you guys.
You can't keep a good man down!

54
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,819
We're superstars now.

55
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,887
J.P. Morgan just faxed over
their congratulations...

56
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,956
and said,
"Welcome to the club."

57
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,837
This also means those teams
headed by Todd and Richie...

58
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,305
who were good enough
to give up their rep numbers...

59
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,071
They can stop cold calling
and start trading again.

60
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,237
Welcome back!

61
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,281
And just to show you
how appreciative I am...

62
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,610
there's a little something extra.

63
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,379
Tell me about it, baby, tell me!

64
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,182
I want you guys
to go up to suite 418.

65
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,255
I handpicked them myself.

66
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,198
We're players now, boys!
Let's celebrate. Salute!

67
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,283
Don't touch the cards.
Don't touch the cards.

68
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,126
- Fourteen.
- Hit me.

69
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,694
Come on, Mike. I told you you
gotta hit the table. Sixteen.

70
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,139
Hit me.

71
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,802
And bust.
Sorry about that.

72
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,904
Fuck! Can't
win a fuckin' hand tonight!

73
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,745
Hey, Steve?
Come here for a second.

74
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,580
You thirsty?
I don't care.

75
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,416
Go take my car and get Mike a Coke
and a falafel. You hungry?

76
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,719
Yeah. Yeah.
Sure. Why not?

77
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,760
- And dealer busts.
- Yeah!

78
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,818
What the fuck are
you so happy about?

79
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,057
Whoa, take it easy.

80
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,326
Roller coaster.
Ups and downs. You know that.

81
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,426
All right. Place your bets.

82
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,096
<i>I was living in Kew Gardens Hills,</i>
<i>running my biz...</i>

83
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,439
<i>giving the Queens College kids</i>
<i>something to do between classes.</i>

84
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,070
- See you guys.
- Fuck you.

85
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,445
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- <i>I was doing well.</i>

86
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,119
<i>It's strange to think how</i>
<i>that knock changed everything.</i>

87
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,758
<i>Everything.</i>
<i>Hey, don't get me wrong here.</i>

88
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,324
No, no. I got it.

89
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,963
<i>I don't believe in fate.</i>
<i>I believe in odds.</i>

90
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,132
- He's not gonna let you in.
- Why not?

91
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,142
'Cause he doesn't know who you are.
He'll think you're a cop.

92
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,941
So what? I got a bankroll
that'll choke a hippo. Let's just see.

93
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,607
- Who are you?
- What's up?

94
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:08,347
- It's my boy, Greg. Oh, shit!
- What are you doin'? Come in.

95
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,049
What's goin' on? Come here, crazy.
What are you doin'?

96
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,956
How're you doin'?
Come in. Come in.

97
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,363
Oh, shit. Wait.
Is that your new ride?

98
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,230
- Him.
- Nice.

99
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,292
- Hi. Seth.
- Hey. Greg.

100
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,701
Nice to meet you.

101
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,934
- We thought we were done for the night.
- Too late to get a couple hands in?

102
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,999
No, no, no. 24-7.

103
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,642
Hey, Steve, could you get us
a couple of sandwiches?

104
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:40,409
- All right. Give me 400.
- Wait. What about the betting?

105
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,650
- What were you thinking?
- Five hundred, max?

106
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,893
We don't usually
service that level of action...

107
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,156
but I hate
to turn away a new customer.

108
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,324
We might not have enough cash
to settle you at the end of the night.

109
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,392
That's okay.
You can just pay me tomorrow.

110
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,938
All right.
How much you want?

111
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:03,635
- Five dimes.
- Jeff.

112
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,006
You had to do it, didn't you?

113
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,738
You make me look
like I'm at the kiddie table.

114
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,906
- If the shoe fits, kid. Come on.
- Fuckin' rich man.

115
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,314
- What denomination?
- What denomination?

116
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,116
How about three Puerto Ricans,
two Chinks and a Guinea?

117
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,213
I don't care. Mix it up.
Whatever you want.

118
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,452
What about a Swahili? Jesus.

119
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,188
I don't know what that is either.
You're starting to upset me.

120
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,389
You got your own chips, huh,
with your name on them?

121
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,364
This is no joke.

122
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:31,961
We used to use the
Bicycle poker chips...

123
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,006
and then some kid started
sneaking in additional funds.

124
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,201
- Who's that? Moyshe?
- No, no. Some kid up the block.

125
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,141
Fuckin' Moyshe.

126
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,611
- So that's a nice car you have there.
- Thanks. A Ferrari.

127
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,949
Yeah. It's a 355,
six-speed transmission, right?

128
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,751
Yeah. It's a synchromesh.
I love it. Nice.

129
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,918
Yo, shit is yellow, B.
Rizzy's the color, nugga.

130
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,258
Yellow's filthy. Come on.

131
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,821
It's Big Bird mode.

132
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,800
All right.
Place your bets.

133
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,241
- Hey.
- You are late.

134
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:20,274
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Your father is really upset.

135
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,618
- He won't even tell me what it is.
- Jesus.

136
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,289
- Hey.
- What's up, Seth?

137
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,888
- How you doin'? How's school?
- It's all right.

138
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,490
That's a good question, Seth.
You wanna tell us what happened?

139
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:40,369
- We didn't know if you were comin'.
- Oh, yeah. Traffic was crazy.

140
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,134
So?

141
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:46,235
Do you wanna wait till after
dinner to talk about it?

142
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,610
Yeah, let's eat first.

143
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:53,812
- Answer the question, Seth.
- I dropped out.

144
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,150
You wanna tell us why?

145
00:10:56,222 --> 00:11:01,182
Well, I gave it a year, Dad,
and it's just not for me.

146
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,423
I see. So that means you've been
lying to us for six months.

147
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,794
Six months, Seth.

148
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:09,392
"School's fine, Dad.
My grades are good, Dad."

149
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:13,427
Let's just leave that for a second.
So you dropped out.

150
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,737
That means you haven't been getting
your student loan checks, right?

151
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,404
Is that right? How are you making
the rent every month, Seth?

152
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:26,073
I'm running a business,
and I'm just earning a living.

153
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:30,919
Earning a living? This what
you call earning a living?

154
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,981
- Marty, are those drugs?
- Yes.

155
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:37,086
- Yes, those are drugs?
- No, Mom. This is an honest living.

156
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,927
And you can ask any one
of my customers.

157
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,365
What do you mean, "customers"?
Where's the customers?

158
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,335
They're children of people
in this community.

159
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:48,169
How do you think I got these?
Anyway, it's illegal.

160
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,268
You're running a backdoor card game!
How do you think this reflects on me?

161
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:57,179
I'm a judge,
for Christ's sake!

162
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:01,345
Are you listening to me?

163
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:06,514
<i>I'm gonna be honest with you.</i>
<i>You're runnin'a good business.</i>

164
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,493
I think you're a smart kid,
pullin' in some real cash.

165
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,123
But I gotta tell you, man,
this is risky fuckin' business.

166
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,532
I mean, you really honestly plan
on dealing cards to college kids...

167
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,695
when you're fuckin' 35?

168
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,968
You don't think you'll get pinched
in the next couple years?

169
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:26,808
Maybe it's time to start thinkin'
about down-the-line time.

170
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,439
So, you want me
to come work for you?

171
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:35,749
What? I guess it'll be like retribution
for me taking all your money here?

172
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,813
First of all, I am not
done with you here, all right?

173
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,950
And, no, you're only gonna
work for me a short time.

174
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,926
You pass the Series Seven.

175
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,453
You learn the ropes.
You're on your own.

176
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,797
Yeah, ask Adam, man.
He'll tell you.

177
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,030
- It's good.
- It's good?

178
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,232
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna be blunt.

179
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,902
We're talkin' about
millions of dollars.

180
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,745
<i>I was making</i>
<i>good money with the casino...</i>

181
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,121
<i>but these guys</i>
<i>were macking it hard.</i>

182
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,854
<i>That's the level</i>
<i>I wanted to be operating on.</i>

183
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:52,489
<i>So I drove out</i>
<i>to Long Island, way out.</i>

184
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:56,626
<i>The office was a good hour</i>
<i>away from Wall Street.</i>

185
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,636
<i>Somebody forgot to tell the guys</i>
<i>who worked there, though.</i>

186
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,365
<i>They looked and acted...</i>

187
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,374
<i>like they took the Six train</i>
<i>to Fulton Street every morning.</i>

188
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,932
<i>But it wasn't Wall Street.</i>

189
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,672
<i>It was exit 53</i>
<i>on the Long Island Expressway...</i>

190
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:11,147
<i>a good hour from</i>
<i>the New York Stock Exchange.</i>

191
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:27,328
No, no, no, no. You don't wanna act now.
This stock is going to turn.

192
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,959
I'm invested very heavily myself.
We just stay put.

193
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,367
I don't know if you've ever had the
opportunity to purchase I.P.O. Before...

194
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,633
but we have this company that's going
to market in about a week or so.

195
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,403
We're gonna have to move on this now.
This is gonna happen next week.

196
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,808
We don't wanna marry this stock.
We're in; we're out.

197
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,780
What do you mean, you don't buy stock
over the phone? How do you do it?

198
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:46,978
Smoke signals? Telepathy? World leaders
solve problems over the phone.

199
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:52,012
I'm not a Charles Schwab.
I don't need your business; I value it.

200
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,549
I'm successful to the point where
I don't need to chase your business.

201
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,359
Hey, kid, get the fuck
outta here!

202
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,165
Over here.

203
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,076
- Have they started interviewing yet?
- No.

204
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:19,743
- Know how long it's gonna be?
- You'll all be going in together.

205
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,286
But I thought
this was, like, an interview?

206
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,949
It is. It's a group interview.
You'll see.

207
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,906
No, man.
You're a male.

208
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,134
<i>Group interview, my ass.</i>

209
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,838
<i>It was like a Hitler Youth rally,</i>
<i>in retrospect.</i>

210
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,507
<i>The guy who pitched us, Jim Young,</i>
<i>was the head recruiter there.</i>

211
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:54,985
- Okay, guys. Let's go.
- <i>Between him and Michael, honestly...</i>

212
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,922
<i>they could sell bubble gum</i>
<i>in the lockjaw ward at Bellevue.</i>

213
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,336
I'm sorry, man.
This is my seat.

214
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,532
- Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.

215
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,008
- Fuckin' dumb-ass.
- Get the fuck outta here.

216
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,606
- What?
- Don't talk to me. Don't look at me.

217
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:29,620
Just get your ass out of that Italian
leather chair and get the fuck out.

218
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:33,385
Right now. Come on.
Let's go, schlepp rock.

219
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,222
Out.

220
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,023
Sit down.

221
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,068
We expect everyone here to
treat their coworkers...

222
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,194
with a certain level
of respect.

223
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,333
Before we start, I have one question.
Has anyone passed a Series Seven exam?

224
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:54,038
- I have a Series Seven license.
- Good for you. You can get out too.

225
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,172
What? Why?

226
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:59,081
We don't hire brokers here.
We train new ones.

227
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:03,383
That's it, Skippy.
Pack your shit. Let's go.

228
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,986
Okay. Here's the deal.

229
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:13,828
I'm not here to waste your time.
I hope you're not here to waste mine.

230
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,799
So I'm gonna keep this short.

231
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,859
If you become an employee
of this firm...

232
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,530
you will make your first million
within three years.

233
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,198
Okay? I repeat that:

234
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:26,108
You will make a million dollars
within three years...

235
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:30,274
of your first day of employment
at J.T. Marlin.

236
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,546
There is no question whether or not
you'll become a millionaire here.

237
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,520
The only question
is how many times over.

238
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:40,115
You think I'm joking?
I am not joking.

239
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:44,026
I am a millionaire.
It's a weird thing to hear, right?

240
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,792
I'll tell ya.
It's a weird thing to say.

241
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,060
I am a fucking millionaire.

242
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:52,228
And guess how old I am.
Twenty-seven.

243
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:56,172
You know what that makes me here?
A fuckin' senior citizen.

244
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,870
This firm is entirely comprised
of people your age, not mine.

245
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,847
Lucky for me, I'm very fucking good
at my job, or I'd be out of one.

246
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,908
You guys are the new blood.
You're gonna go home with the <i>kessef.</i>

247
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:10,421
You are the future big swinging dicks
of this firm.

248
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,482
Now, you all look money hungry,
and that's good.

249
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,462
Anybody tells you money is the root
of all evil doesn't fuckin' have any.

250
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,091
They say money can't buy happiness?
Look at the fuckin' smile on my face.

251
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,762
Ear to ear, baby.
You want details? Fine.

252
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,466
I drive a Ferrari
355 Cabriolet.

253
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,603
What's up? I have a ridiculous house
in the South Fork.

254
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,274
I have every toy you could imagine,
and best of all, kids...

255
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,283
I am liquid.

256
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:43,788
So, now you know what's possible.
Let me tell you what's required.

257
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:48,293
You are required to work
your fucking ass off at this firm.

258
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,127
We want winners here, not pikers.
A piker walks at the bell.

259
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:57,635
A piker asks how much vacation you get
in the first year. Vacation?

260
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:01,036
People come and work at this firm
for one reason: To become filthy rich.

261
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:05,543
We're not here to make friends.
We're not savin' the manatees, guys.

262
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,876
You want vacation time?
Go teach third grade, public school.

263
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,818
Okay. The first three months
at the firm are as a trainee.

264
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,119
You make $150 a week.

265
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,355
After you're done training,
you take the Series Seven.

266
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:24,895
Pass that, you become junior broker...

267
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,624
and you open accounts
for your team leader.

268
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:30,395
You open 40 accounts, you start
workin' for yourself. Sky's the limit.

269
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,902
Word about being a trainee.

270
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,235
Friends, parents, other brokers,
they're gonna give you shit.

271
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,538
It's true. $150 a week?
Not a lot of money.

272
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,508
Pay them no mind.

273
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,911
You need to learn this business,
and this is the time to do it.

274
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,848
Once you pass the test,
none of that's gonna matter.

275
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,977
Your friends are shit.

276
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,681
Tell them you made 25 grand last month,
they're won't fucking believe you.

277
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,122
Fuck them! Fuck 'em!

278
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,855
Parents don't like the life you lead?
"Fuck you, Mom and Dad."

279
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:01,366
See how it feels when you're makin'
their fuckin' Lexus payments.

280
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:05,028
Now, go home and think about it.
Think about whether it's really for you.

281
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:08,561
If you decide it isn't...
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

282
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,736
It's not for everyone.
Thanks.

283
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,974
But if you
really want this...

284
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,540
you call me on Monday
and we'll talk.

285
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:23,213
Just don't
waste my fuckin' time.

286
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,449
Okay. That's it.

287
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,061
- Hi.
- Hi.

288
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,267
So, what's up?

289
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:21,972
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine, Seth. What's on your mind?

290
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:27,417
I feel bad about the way things went
at the house last week.

291
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:32,421
I just don't feel like we get
anywhere when we talk at home.

292
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:36,291
Well, I don't know
that there's anything to talk about.

293
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:40,297
- Can I get you anything to drink?
- No. I'm fine, thanks.

294
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,129
You dropped out
of school, Seth.

295
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,398
You're running an illegal casino
out of your apartment.

296
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,202
You're putting my career at risk.
What is there to talk about, Seth?

297
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:55,144
Well, I don't know why
we can't just discuss this. I mean...

298
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,272
Maybe you're just not
seeing my side.

299
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,716
Your side? What side?
You're doing wrong.

300
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,981
I'm not your best friend.
That's your mother's racket.

301
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,523
I'm your father.
I tell you when you screw up.

302
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,491
What did you think I was gonna do?
Pat you on the back for the casino idea?

303
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,085
Tell you what
a great entrepreneur you are?

304
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,629
So what do you want me
to do, Seth?

305
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,431
I mean, my God, if I'd called my father
to meet me for a cup of coffee...

306
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,529
to talk about my screwups,
he probably would've laughed.

307
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:24,302
We didn't have nice little chats
about why I was a bad boy.

308
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,207
I got smacked.

309
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,076
And I didn't do it again.
Much simpler.

310
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,548
Look. I'm just trying to restore
what's left of our relationship.

311
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,710
"Relationship"?

312
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:38,017
What the fuck are you
talking about, relationship?

313
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,520
What? Are we dating?

314
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,719
I'm not your girlfriend Seth;
I'm your father.

315
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,092
Clean up your life,
make an honest living...

316
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:48,860
and then you and I can talk
like normal people, all right?

317
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,421
- Hey, Seth.
- Hi. How you doin'?

318
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:23,798
- Abby.
- Oh, yeah. I know. I forgot.

319
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,133
It's okay. I never told you.

320
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,570
Besides, the other day
you looked a little frazzled...

321
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,871
so I didn't think
you'd remember anyway.

322
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,040
- Today's my first day.
- No shit?

323
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,844
Yeah.

324
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,283
- See ya.
- See ya.

325
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,424
No, that's not how it works.

326
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,725
If I was asking you to
own 5,000 or 10,000 shares...

327
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,892
of some pink-sheet, bullshit company
with negative earnings...

328
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,764
I'd tell you
to hang up the phone...

329
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,669
call your local broker
and short the stock.

330
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:05,574
I wouldn't expect your business.
But, Don, I am bringing you...

331
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:10,240
Seth. Seth. Come over here.
It's not your table.

332
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:13,682
...F.D.A. Landmark approval.
It's, like, the cancer pill.

333
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:19,054
No. It's a cancer pill.
No, Don, it's not Propecia P.

334
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,821
It is the cancer pill.
Oh, Donald, please take a chance.

335
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,021
You look pretty.

336
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,462
Thank you.

337
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,695
So you wanna tell me where the fuck
you were last night?

338
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,068
- Not particularly.
- Okay.

339
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,104
This is for you.

340
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,675
I don't know how to better
explain this to you, but...

341
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,547
it's over.

342
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,524
Okay. I disagree.

343
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,990
- Hang on a second.
- Here you go.

344
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,959
- What's up? Is he in?
- I don't know.

345
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,370
Hey. These are the D&B cards.
These are our leads.

346
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,743
- Morning.
- Every card is an opportunity, right?

347
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:19,215
These are good leads.
People on these cards buy stock.

348
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,582
Your job is to call them
and get them interested in the firm.

349
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,417
You're not actually selling stock yet,
but you're selling the dream.

350
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,423
So get 'em wet. Tell 'em
that in a month from now...

351
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:30,052
a senior broker's gonna
call them back with an idea.

352
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,618
So who are these people?

353
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,062
Average client's 45 years old,
from the Midwest...

354
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,898
$150,000 annual income,
1 million net, has a local broker...

355
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:41,097
but loves a hotshot New Yorker
who sounds good on the phone.

356
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,608
So the card won't tell you that. It only
has name, address and occupation.

357
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:48,237
So you gotta
feel 'em out, see?

358
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,680
"Peter Davis, Vice President,
Parks Telecommunications."

359
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,684
The guy's probably
a fuckin' whale.

360
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:57,449
So feel 'im out, see what he's got.
Truth is, it doesn't matter these days.

361
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:00,582
With the Dow where it is now,
everybody wants a piece of the market.

362
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:04,288
I can close anyone anytime anywhere.
Just give me a phone number.

363
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,092
- Greg, I have John Duncklee on three.
- Not now. I'll call him back.

364
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,929
Now, once you qualify the guy,
you send him a press packet.

365
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:13,459
It'll be easy, and it'll get you
comfortable on the phone, which is key.

366
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:17,770
This entire business revolves
around the phone. Play the numbers.

367
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:21,300
This is a contact sport. The more people
you contact, the better you'll do.

368
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:26,078
- A good broker makes 700 calls a day.
- What's the phone bill like?

369
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,619
This month
was approaching 400,000.

370
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,520
Listen to me. Even though
you're not selling stock yet...

371
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,991
I want you to remember the code
we have here, okay?

372
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,994
- Did you see <i>Glengarry Glen Ross?</i>
- Yeah.

373
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,190
- Do you remember "ABC"?
- Yeah. "Always be closing."

374
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,893
That's right. "Always be closing."
"Telling's not selling."

375
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:47,428
That's the attitude you wanna have.
There's two rules as a trainee.

376
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,440
Number one:
We don't pitch the bitch here.

377
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,839
What?

378
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,310
We don't sell stock to women.
I don't care who it is; we don't do it.

379
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,210
Nancy Sinatra calls,
you tell her you're sorry.

380
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,873
They're a constant pain
in the ass...

381
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,940
and you're never
gonna hear the end of it.

382
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,578
They'll call you every fucking day
wanting to know why the stock dropped.

383
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,383
And God forbid
the stock should go up.

384
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,481
You're gonna hear
from them every 15 minutes.

385
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,755
It's just not worth it.
Don't pitch the bitch.

386
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,989
Number two:
Don't write wood, all right?

387
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,759
A lot of trainees are so anxious
to get off the phone...

388
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,233
that they just steamroll the guy
into getting the press packet...

389
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,633
so they can hang up.

390
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,000
Then I call back, and I'm, like...

391
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,232
"Hi. You spoke to a junior
associate of mine last month."

392
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,242
And he's like, "Not interested. Bye."
That's a shitty lead, okay?

393
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,609
That's fucking wood.
The info we send is bullshit, all right?

394
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,582
The most important part is telling them
you have that one great idea...

395
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,949
and that a senior broker's
gonna call them back in a month.

396
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,148
This way they don't think
we just fire off a million recos a day.

397
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,656
We don't want clients thinkin'...

398
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,715
you're pitching something
you read in the <i>Journal,</i> right?

399
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,818
- Yeah. Right.
- Okay, so no wood.

400
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:47,160
- I'm serious. No wood.
- All right. Take it easy.

401
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:52,135
Hey, don't even start
that fuckin' shit with me, okay?

402
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,070
I'm tryin' to tell you what's expected
of you and what your job is.

403
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,270
I'm tryin' to make the job easier, okay?
Don't give me any fuckin' lip.

404
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,007
Okay. Okay, so, fine.

405
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:06,915
What happens if the guy
wants to buy stock right then?

406
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:10,386
Now you're talkin'. You wanna go
into every call expecting just that.

407
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,753
If somebody wants a recommendation,
put the guy on hold...

408
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,622
stand up and yell "reco"
at the top of your lungs.

409
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,720
First senior broker who gets
on the horn gets the sale.

410
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,061
- Sound good?
- Yeah.

411
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:26,160
Okay. That suit's dog shit.
Get a new suit.

412
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:29,070
No, Ma. I told you.
No, I'm not a broker yet.

413
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,303
I'm a trainee. I still have
to pass my Series Seven test.

414
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,901
<i>Please.</i>
<i>You're a stockbroker.</i>

415
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,538
You wear a suit to work
every day, don't you?

416
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,943
- Yeah.
- So, what are we arguing about?

417
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,750
- Thanks, Ma.
- You're doing great, Seth.

418
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,849
You're working your way up
from the bottom. Never easy.

419
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,757
What did Dad say about it?

420
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:53,423
<i>He's very happy.</i>
<i>Shocked, but very happy.</i>

421
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:57,059
- He's waiting for you to call him.
- Why doesn't he call me?

422
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:01,128
- <i>One miracle at a time, okay, sweetie?</i>
- All right.

423
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,708
- <i>Mom?</i>
- <i>I'm in bed.</i>

424
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:18,082
- How you doin'?
- Hi, baby. How was work?

425
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:21,955
I know you're not at home with a bag
of cash, waiting for me to call you.

426
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,654
But I'm not some 18-year old selling
the cure for Al DS. I am 46 years old.

427
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:28,563
I have 22 years of market experience.
I know this business.

428
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:31,625
So pick up your skirt, grab your balls
and let's make some money.

429
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,331
Here you go, Greg.

430
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:37,897
I hope this is better
than the last batch of shit you gave me.

431
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:41,412
- Produced more wood than Ron Jeremy.
- What?

432
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:45,813
I don't want you to yell "reco" anymore.
Know what you should yell? "Timber!"

433
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,512
Yeah. Mr. Fuckin' Wood.
I hear you fuckin' makin' your calls.

434
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,554
It's bullshit, all right?

435
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,386
If you want them off the phone so bad,
why don't you just hang up?

436
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,551
You should get them excited.
You know, excited?

437
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,687
They should beg for a broker
on the first call. Shit.

438
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:03,496
Yeah. Howard Young, please.
Seth Davis over at J.T. Marlin.

439
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:07,060
- No, he's not expecting my call.
- No. Tsk.

440
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,333
- Okay. Yeah. I'll call you.
- Good-bye. Good-bye.

441
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,772
Hang up the phone.

442
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:13,436
Thank you. That's nice
for you to do that for me.

443
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:16,639
First of all, there's gonna be a lot of
these regardless of how good you are...

444
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,478
but you happen to suck big,
fat-ass rhinoceros dick.

445
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,781
Well, thank you.
That's confidence-inspiring.

446
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,946
I got this friend who runs this
other firm, right?

447
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,786
He hands out
this book to new trainees.

448
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,793
It's called a rebuttal book.
It looks like a little Filofax.

449
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,625
It's got these index tabs,
but instead of having letters...

450
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:36,394
like "A" to "B," "G" to "H,"
it has different things like...

451
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,492
"My wife won't let me"...

452
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,300
or "I'm not in the market now"
or "Send me a prospectus."

453
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,306
It has a rebuttal
for any excuse.

454
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,365
Anyway, that's stuff
you'll have to learn later.

455
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,173
The most important thing
you gotta know right now...

456
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,714
is that you can be whoever
you wanna be on the phone.

457
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,616
You know what I'm sayin'? Who cares?
Do what you gotta do.

458
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,917
Change your last name.
Say you're the fuckin' vice president.

459
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,186
You know? Who cares?
Just get the cocksucker on the line.

460
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:05,161
Yeah, but how can I do shit like that?
Isn't there a compliance officer here?

461
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,926
No. No, man. Everybody does that shit.
Are you kidding?

462
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,626
I mean, even on Wall Street.

463
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,101
You talking about John there?
That guy works for us.

464
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,071
The guy's a fuckin' chimp. Look at him.
The only compliance work...

465
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,438
he's doin' is makin' sure my lunch
is still hot when it gets here.

466
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:23,003
He's only here because the S.E.C.
Requires it. Easiest job in the world.

467
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:26,414
Look. I think he's actually
masturbating right now.

468
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:38,190
- Stay the fuck away from her.
- Yeah.

469
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,797
Holy shit, you slut.
You made the call.

470
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:46,633
No, no. Don't you dare. Get your
filthy one-race paws off my money.

471
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,501
What'd you bet me?
A month's commission?

472
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,201
- Yeah, and yours too, kid.
- How do you get away with this?

473
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,437
'Cause I'm a Jew,
and I have the mind of a champion.

474
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:54,876
See this?

475
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:59,383
Here, kid.
Go get a tan and some Rogaine.

476
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,385
- Watch out for this.
- Fuckin' A.

477
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:05,889
The only bookie in New York
that delivers FedEx.

478
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:12,629
When are you gonna
take the test, Seth?

479
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,996
Well, you know, after
the training program's over.

480
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,627
They want you to get a good idea
of how things work there...

481
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,797
before you take the Series Seven,
but it's a great system.

482
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,273
- I'm really learning a lot.
- Are you gonna be rich, Seth?

483
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,675
- Oh, God willing.
- I hope so.

484
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,714
How come I've
never heard of this firm?

485
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,512
I don't know.

486
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,347
It's a smaller firm, I guess.

487
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,116
There's a million others like it
you probably never heard of.

488
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:41,420
The reason I ask is 'cause I would've
thought that you would've...

489
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:45,622
joined a firm like Goldman Sachs
or something of that stature.

490
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,689
- Marty, what are you starting for?
- What?

491
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:53,430
No, no. Ma, it's okay.
The reason is, Dad...

492
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,996
that the larger houses don't really like
to hire kids straight out of college...

493
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:00,044
you know, unless you went
to an Ivy League school...

494
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:04,104
or you wanna do cash-flow analysis
for the next 15 years.

495
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:08,309
They usually like you
to work...

496
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:12,447
outside their firm for a few years
to get a good sense of the marketplace.

497
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:17,153
But most all brokers usually start out
in little firms like J.T. Marlin.

498
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,928
That's great. See? He answered
the question. That was easy.

499
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:29,901
So all you have to do
is close the casino, right?

500
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:36,180
Marty,
we talked about this.

501
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:40,047
- What are you giving me looks for?
- Didn't we talk about this?

502
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:43,144
- What? I just...
- It was a celebration.

503
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:48,523
You know what?
I gotta go meet somebody.

504
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,391
I love you, Ma.

505
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,987
See ya.
See ya later.

506
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,556
Nice job, Marty.

507
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:07,911
<i>Originally, I got in for the cash.</i>
<i>But getting my dad's respect...</i>

508
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,913
<i>That's what kept me there.</i>

509
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:14,315
<i>So he took some parting shots from time</i>
<i>to time. Whatever. I didn't care.</i>

510
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,649
<i>Not really.</i>

511
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,554
<i>Anyway, the point is,</i>
<i>I had to adapt to this new world.</i>

512
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,285
<i>I didn't really know these guys.</i>

513
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,193
<i>What I did know is that they had</i>
<i>all the money in the world...</i>

514
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,061
<i>and not a clue</i>
<i>what to do with it.</i>

515
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,825
Seth, what's up, man?

516
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,394
- <i>Wait outside.</i>
- Hey, man.

517
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:11,169
Thought you weren't gonna make it, man.
Sit down. Grab a slice. Have a beer.

518
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,334
What's up?

519
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,469
You think he fucked
Hannah or Sheen fucked her?

520
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,809
- Both of 'em.
- Did he just move in?

521
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:21,250
- He's been here eight months.
- <i>Life all comes down to a few moments.</i>

522
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:25,415
"This is one of 'em."
Sheen was kind of a pimp.

523
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,425
Shut up, man. Listen. Gecko's coming on.
"What the hell's goin' on?"

524
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:32,930
I'm lookin' at 200,000 shares moved.
I wanna know if we're part of it.

525
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:36,330
We'd better be, or I'm gonna come down
and eat your lunch. Back in two, Alex.

526
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,496
Look. I loved it at forty.
Fifty? It's an insult.

527
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,267
Their analysts? They don't know
a preferred stock from livestock.

528
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,401
They wait till it goes down,
and like gumdrops and sperm counts...

529
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:53,107
This is the kid. Calls me 59 days
in a row. Wants to be a player.

530
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,847
Oughta be a picture of you in the
dictionary under "persistent," kid.

531
00:35:56,921 --> 00:36:00,186
Yeah? Now, listen, Jerry, I'm
looking for negative control.

532
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,725
No more than 30, 35 percent.

533
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:04,454
Just enough to block
anybody else's merger plans...

534
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,861
and find out from the inside
if the books are cooked.

535
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:11,595
Looks this good on paper, we're
in the kill zone, pal. Lock and load.

536
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,069
Lunch? You gotta be kidding.
Lunch is for wimps.

537
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,301
Okay, Fidel,
I'll talk at you.

538
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,468
Very good.

539
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:23,173
How do you do, Mr. Gekko?
Bud Fox.

540
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:26,546
So you say, "Nice to meet you."
Hope you're intelligent.

541
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,710
Where'd you get these?

542
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,949
- I got a connection at the airport.
- Nice job, Mr. Clean.

543
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,719
Hey. Get the fuck off me.

544
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:41,087
- <i>I'm really busy, Seth.</i>
- No. Look, I understand, Doctor.

545
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,655
<i>I'm really busy here myself.</i>

546
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,759
We're gonna come back to you
in one month with one idea only.

547
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:49,772
If you like what we have to say, great.
We'll do business. If not...

548
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,968
<i>I mean, worst-case scenario, you'll hear</i>
<i>yourself a new business idea...</i>

549
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,912
- That X ray is useless.
- We'll part as friends, right?

550
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:57,675
What?

551
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,978
Are you working with a million
dollars in the market now?

552
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,040
Who is this?

553
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:05,020
You're a doctor. Have you heard
of a drug called Phenodryl?

554
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,353
<i>It's being manufactured</i>
<i>by M.S.C. Pharmaceuticals.</i>

555
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,449
No.

556
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:12,963
Well, listen, okay? It's in the
third stage of F.D.A. Approval.

557
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,965
<i>Word is it's gonna be approved</i>
<i>within the next three months...</i>

558
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,024
<i>and it could be tomorrow</i>
<i>for all I know.</i>

559
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:21,503
But, you know,
I'm getting ahead of myself...

560
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,439
and you're real busy over there...

561
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,271
<i>so why don't I just send you out</i>
<i>the information...</i>

562
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,643
Wait, wait, wait.
Forget the info.

563
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,581
<i>Let's talk about this now.</i>

564
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,140
What was the name
of that drug again?

565
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,948
Could you hold on
for one second?

566
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,046
<i>I'm gonna get...</i>

567
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:42,217
a senior broker who's a little more
familiar with that particular stock.

568
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:45,888
All right? Hold on a second.
One second.

569
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,262
Reco!

570
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,974
- Got it.
- Sorry.

571
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,416
His name's Dr. Jacobs,
and I'd say that he's definitely...

572
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,613
- Whoa. I don't wanna hear it, kid.
- Okay.

573
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:15,655
Hi, Dr. Jacobs?
This is Chris Marlin at J.T. Marlin.

574
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:19,184
- Marlin?
- <i>Right. He's my father.</i>

575
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:21,527
My associate tells me you're interested
in one of our stocks.

576
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,193
<i>Your wife's on three.</i>
<i>I will call her back.</i>

577
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,634
<i>Yes. M.S.C. Sounds like</i>
<i>it might be interesting.</i>

578
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,194
Might be?

579
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:32,368
"Might be" doesn't sell stock at the
rate M.S.C.'s going for it, Dr. Jacobs.

580
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,105
- We're talking very high volume.
- <i>I still have to run it by my people.</i>

581
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,842
That's great, Doc, if you wanna miss
yet another opportunity here...

582
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,214
and watch your colleagues
get rich doing clinical trials.

583
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,448
- Don't buy a share and hang up.
- <i>Hold on a second.</i>

584
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:48,185
- <i>I just want to talk about it more.</i>
- Honestly, I don't have the time.

585
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:52,093
This stock is blowing up right now.
The whole firm's going nuts.

586
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,621
Hold on. Let me open up
the door to my office.

587
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,993
Oh, my God!

588
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,632
See that, Doc?
That's my trading floor.

589
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:07,667
I have calls to make to a million other
doctors who are already in the know.

590
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:11,579
I can't walk you through this right now.
I'm sorry.

591
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,979
<i>Okay, okay.</i>
<i>Let's do this.</i>

592
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:25,188
Since you're a new account, I can't go
higher than 2,000 shares. I'm sorry.

593
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:31,167
2,000? Are you nuts? That is way
beyond what I was thinking. 2,000?

594
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,169
Jesus!

595
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,800
Listen. I'm curious. Why can't you
sell me any more than that?

596
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,400
Well, we like to establish a
relationship with our clients...

597
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:44,881
on something small before we get
to the more serious trades.

598
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:49,409
Let me show you several
percentage points on this small trade...

599
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,421
and then we'll talk
about doing future business.

600
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,549
That sounds good.
Give me the 2,000 shares.

601
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,755
- Done.
- You sure you can't do better on this?

602
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,889
- I'm sorry, Dr. Jacobs. I can't.
- All right.

603
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,298
- We'll start with this trade, then.
- Great. I promise...

604
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,427
we'll swing for the fences
on the next one.

605
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:10,304
Do you want that confirmation
sent to your office or your mansion?

606
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:13,537
<i>Very funny,</i>
<i>Mr. Marlin.</i>

607
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:17,069
Let me put my secretary on,
and she'll take down your info.

608
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,345
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

609
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,080
Done and done.

610
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,625
Yeah, baby!

611
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:35,158
- So, why'd you put a max on his buy?
- What?

612
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,700
Why'd you put a max on his buy?

613
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,633
You didn't tell him
how it works?

614
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:43,571
He's a trainee. He doesn't need
to know initial sell limits.

615
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:48,203
Make sure he shows you the ropes, kid.
He's too busy callin' his bookie.

616
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,510
Fuckin' Hebrews. Always lookin' out
for themselves and never the trainees.

617
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,813
- Hey, hey.
- Why don't you go back to Little Italy?

618
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:59,288
Go make me a latke, dreidel boy.
Abrams, look me up on the board.

619
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:03,190
The reason I capped him
is in case he's a piker.

620
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,319
See, we're gonna front the money
for this sale...

621
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,627
and if he doesn't send the check,
I'm the one holding the bag, follow me?

622
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,563
Right.

623
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,761
Last commission month, the kid on Jim's
team wrote a million-dollar ticket.

624
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,829
Stock was down 31/2 points
by settlement.

625
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,931
Fuckin' kid took
a 1/4 million-dollar hit.

626
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:20,340
- Shit.
- You know how much that hurts?

627
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,847
Besides, the first sell
just whets the appetite.

628
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:27,145
If he's a whale...
which it looks like he is...

629
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:30,085
then I'll get him on a day
when there's a real rip.

630
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,644
What's a rip?

631
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,782
A commission.
That's why we work here.

632
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,918
We make huge rips.

633
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,430
No, I don't... I still
don't know how it works.

634
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,295
Okay.

635
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:46,166
A two-dollar rip, which is unheard of
anywhere on Wall Street...

636
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:49,570
means that we're walkin' away...

637
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,940
with two dollars
for every share we sell.

638
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:57,037
Real money.
That's opportunity.

639
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:59,742
Jesus, Greg, you show him
where the bathroom is yet?

640
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,718
Yeah, Seth, I showed you
where Chris's desk is, right?

641
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:06,517
- Richie, do something with this...
- How does Michael afford that?

642
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,919
- Couldn't tell you.
- Okay.

643
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,759
If he's doin' it, he's makin' money
on it. Point is:

644
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,391
Service your client right,
and he'll be back for more.

645
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:19,095
Show him a three-percent return...

646
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:21,467
and he'll trust you to
watch his kids for the weekend.

647
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,685
- Abby.
- Hey, Seth.

648
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:39,712
- Hi.
- You wanna go get yourself a drink?

649
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,384
Yeah.
You want anything?

650
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,053
Oh. Okay.

651
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:56,033
I thought this was supposed to
be a big broker hangout.

652
00:42:56,106 --> 00:43:00,509
Merrill Lynch. Salomon Brothers.
Mad, big-dick Steve. What is this place?

653
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,809
This looks like the fucking
Christmas party at Mutual of Omaha.

654
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:07,078
Yo, check this out.
Joe.

655
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:10,484
Oh, my God. Would you
look at these monkeys?

656
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:14,149
So, who do you live with?

657
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:17,387
You mean, is the little black girl here
takin' care of her grandma...

658
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,554
'cause her mama's
a crackhead?

659
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,292
Yeah, exactly. I thought
it was smack, though.

660
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,926
Right.

661
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,334
Boy, you gotta get ahold
of that edge. It's kinda sharp.

662
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:33,308
I know. It's just that
I get so much shit at J. <i>T...</i>

663
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:36,278
that sometimes I have
to get in that mode just to...

664
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,907
fend them off of me, you know?

665
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:43,113
Yeah, I was gonna ask you
why are you there...

666
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,985
because it doesn't seem like the ideal
working environment for a black woman.

667
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,320
No, it isn't. It's just that...

668
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,327
how many secretaries do you know
that make 80 grand a year?

669
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:54,193
- One.
- Exactly.

670
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:59,268
- "No, no, no. I gotta call the boss."
- Look at this guy. Check it.

671
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:01,964
No way.
Vito Corleone.

672
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,700
You don't come all my life...

673
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,641
and then you show up
at my daughter's confirmation.

674
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,577
"Are you standin' up or sittin' down?"
By that time l...

675
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,378
- How you doin'?
- What's up?

676
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,886
- You guys lookin' for a broker?
- Who the fuck are you?

677
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,388
- Easy.
- I'm not doin' anything.

678
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,515
I thought maybe you were lookin'
for somebody to invest with.

679
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:25,358
- No. Yeah, we're fine. We are brokers.
- You are?

680
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:29,331
- Yeah.
- You guys with Jacoby & Jacoby?

681
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,131
- J.T. Marlin.
- Never heard of it.

682
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:36,070
Hold on a second. Who are you?
What do you sell? Car insurance?

683
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,906
We're with this little firm downtown.
Maybe you've heard of us.J.P. Morgan?

684
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:43,469
- And I'm a black Negro.
- Right.

685
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:47,005
I know J.T. It's a fuckin' chop shop.
They named it so it sounds like ours.

686
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,678
He knows that firm.
It's a fuckin' chop shop.

687
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:53,621
They named the firm to sound
like his. What is he, fucking Yogi Biz?

688
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:57,058
- Shut the fuck up.
- We're not buying it.

689
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:01,393
And what the fuck is with the suits?
You look like you're on Gotti's crew.

690
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,730
- You look great. Seriously.
- Do you know who you're talkin' to?

691
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:06,997
- Who are we talkin' to?
- You don't know?

692
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,663
Here's Vito and John Jr.

693
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,333
I don't wanna get involved in this.
We're not bothering you.

694
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:15,504
We're not.
Patrick, call out the police. Come on!

695
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,247
It's my dad
that's the mess...

696
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:24,481
but that's not
really interesting conversation.

697
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,614
What about you?

698
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:32,560
Single mother. No money.
And now I take care of her.

699
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:37,692
- What's wrong?
- She's got chronic pneumonia.

700
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:40,760
You know, she smoked for, like,
15 years, and now she's really sick.

701
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,033
And it's...

702
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:46,907
She's just really happy that I have
this job so I can support both of us.

703
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:51,038
- But it's scary sometimes, you know?
- Yeah.

704
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:55,211
What about your father?

705
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:58,914
I don't wanna talk
about my father either.

706
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,922
Ready?

707
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,435
<i>- Tell me a story.</i>
<i>- What do you wanna hear?</i>

708
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:18,441
I don't know. Tell me...
Tell me a story about your dad.

709
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,643
Well, I have
so many great ones.

710
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,807
Go on. Tell me.

711
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,385
All right.

712
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:35,054
Well, I'm ten years old...

713
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,289
and I just
got this new bike.

714
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:42,457
It's a silver Mongoose,
you know, like BMX.

715
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:48,438
And I'm skidding out in this puddle
like Starsky and Hutch.

716
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:52,168
- Right.
- And my foot slips...

717
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:56,872
and the pedal spins around
hard enough to break my leg.

718
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,881
- Oh, my God.
- But I don't fall off the bike.

719
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:04,285
- I keep going down this hill.
- And I get really scared, you know?

720
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:07,187
So I jumped off the bike...

721
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:09,782
and I landed
behind this parked car.

722
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:15,321
And I was laying there
for a good half hour.

723
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,424
And finally...

724
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:21,164
I hear my father's voice up the street,
and he's calling my name.

725
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,798
And I was so happy...

726
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,240
that he was coming
to get me.

727
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:31,373
And he comes around the car,
and he sees me lying there.

728
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:34,417
I mean, there was...
there was blood everywhere.

729
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,884
Anyway,
I look up at him...

730
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:41,891
and for the first time in my life,
I see how much my father loved me.

731
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:46,663
- 'Cause he was completely frozen.
- Wow.

732
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:50,257
You know, it hurt him to see me
in that much pain.

733
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,826
So he leans down
over me...

734
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,669
and he slaps me
across the face.

735
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:01,734
What? Why?

736
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,337
I don't know.

737
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:10,678
Maybe he was mad at me for
making him feel that helpless...

738
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:15,453
or it was the only thing
he could think of.

739
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,925
I don't really care
anymore.

740
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:22,193
What I think of now is the look
on his face when he saw me lying there.

741
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,929
And that's what I remember.

742
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,404
That's what I miss.

743
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:39,942
There's your story.

744
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,213
Sorry.

745
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,952
All right. I wanna talk
to you guys about appearance.

746
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:53,224
Okay? Because most of you
dress like shit.

747
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,390
I don't know what
your financial situation is...

748
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:58,832
and I don't want to, but you gotta get
yourself at least one decent suit...

749
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:02,895
because we have a minimum level
of aesthetic professionalism here...

750
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,634
that we have to maintain.

751
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,676
In three months, you can outfit
your whole closet...

752
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,404
but for now get something
to hold you over.

753
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:11,572
There's an important phrase
we use here.

754
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,775
I think it's time
you all learned it.

755
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:17,110
"Act as if."

756
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,314
Do you understand what that means?

757
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:22,187
Act as if you are
the president of this firm.

758
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,695
Act as if you got a nine-inch cock.
Act as if.

759
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,697
And to do that properly,
you need to at least look the part.

760
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:32,531
So go get dressed. Secondly, it's time
to get your Series Seven books.

761
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:35,298
Don't get nervous.
If you study, you'll pass.

762
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:39,741
Then you begin trading
as an S.E.C. -licensed broker.

763
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,974
Then you're a fucking millionaire,
and it's just that simple.

764
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:47,642
I need 300 bucks from each
of you for the books...

765
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:50,380
which will be returned
if and when you pass the exam.

766
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:53,946
And I need that tomorrow.
That is all.

767
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:03,558
What are you?
Last night's erection?

768
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,067
Yeah, well, you know...

769
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,540
What's goin' on?
We're movin' to the big house, kids.

770
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:17,103
Isaac here just closed a guy
for 30,000 shares of Farrow Tech.

771
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,114
We're on the big board.
We're in there now?

772
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:22,709
- Who's out?
- Todd and company. Come on. Let's go.

773
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:27,746
If you couldn't pull $3,000 together,
your name wouldn't be on my desk.

774
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:31,817
You're embarrassing me. I'm pitching you
from under my desk. I'm embarrassed now.

775
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:34,921
Bob. Bob, be rude.
Hang up the phone.

776
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:37,592
You won't.
You wanna know why?

777
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:41,660
Because you see value. I am
your kids' college fund, for chrissakes.

778
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:45,037
I'm gonna pass. The only people making
money passing are N.F.L. Quarterbacks.

779
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:48,839
- And I don't see a number on your back.
- <i>Take me off your list.</i>

780
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:52,746
Fine, fine. I'm gonna take you off
my list of successful people.

781
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,859
Hello?

782
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:07,089
<i>Hi, Mr. "Dahvis," this is Ron</i>
<i>from the</i> Daily News.

783
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:10,429
- <i>How you doin'?</i>
- It's Davis, and I'm not interested.

784
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,095
<i>- Sorry to bother you. Have a nice day.</i>
- Wait a minute.

785
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:18,005
Wait. That's your pitch?
You consider that a sales call?

786
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,566
You know, I get a call
from you guys every Saturday...

787
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,612
and it's always
the same half-assed attempt.

788
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,943
If you guys wanna close me,
you should sell me.

789
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:28,951
- <i>All right.</i>
- All right. Start again.

790
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,386
<i>Okay. Hi, this is Ron</i>
<i>from the</i> Daily News.

791
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:36,415
- <i>How you doin' this morning?</i>
- Shitty. What do you want?

792
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:39,121
<i>It's not what I want, sir.</i>
<i>It's what you want.</i>

793
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:42,256
Ron, now we're talkin'.
All right. What are you selling me?

794
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:46,132
<i>I'm offering a Daily News subscription</i>
<i>at a substantially reduced price.</i>

795
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:49,434
<i>We're trying to reach out to people</i>
<i>that never had home delivery before.</i>

796
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:53,840
So everybody who already has a
subscription is getting fucked?

797
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:57,539
- <i>Yeah. I guess so.</i>
- All right. I can handle that.

798
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,742
So, why should I buy <i>your</i> paper?
I mean, you know...

799
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:04,378
Why shouldn't I get the <i>Times</i>
or the <i>Voice,</i> you know?

800
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,685
<i>The</i> Village Voice <i>is free, sir,</i> so if
<i>you want it, you should pick it up.</i>

801
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:11,523
<i>But the</i> Daily News <i>offers you something</i>
<i>no other paper can... a taste of New York.</i>

802
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:14,655
<i>We have the best features, more photos</i>
<i>than any other daily in New York...</i>

803
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:17,063
<i>and we have the most</i>
<i>reliable delivery in the city.</i>

804
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,294
<i>Now what do you think?</i>

805
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:21,496
You know what I think, Ron?
I think that was a sales call.

806
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:24,199
Good job, buddy.

807
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,970
<i>So you gonna</i>
<i>buy a subscription?</i>

808
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:30,672
No. I already
get the <i>Times.</i>

809
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,874
<i>I know what you're sayin'!</i>

810
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:38,279
Booked. Booked.
I got a hundred against.

811
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:41,017
Booked. Someone cover Greg.
Cover Greg.

812
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:47,692
I hope you guys aren't fightin' over it.
Here. Good money against Greg's roll.

813
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:51,461
- Put it there.
- Two hundred?

814
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,964
- What is that?
- Nothing.

815
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:03,012
Damn. Who you gotta ass-fuck
to get a ten around here?

816
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,172
- There's a leprechaun in stall four.
- Whatever.

817
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:08,149
Hey, Seth, I'm gonna get some reserves.
You wanna come with me?

818
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:09,651
- Yeah.
- You guys want a shot?

819
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:12,711
Roll a seven, baby. Let's go.

820
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:17,089
Quit starin'
and just apologize.

821
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,994
Hey, he doesn't have to say shit,
all right?

822
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:24,261
Why don't you go back to your Heineken
and shut the fuck up, okay?

823
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,667
Was I talkin' to you?

824
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:30,205
No, you weren't.
You were talkin' to him.

825
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:33,401
If you're talkin' to him, you're talkin'
to me and my whole fuckin' crew, okay?

826
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:38,345
Get the fuck outta here.
What? What?

827
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:41,407
Get the fuck outta here before
I put you in a mayonnaise jar, okay?

828
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:44,578
Get the fuck outta here,
fuckin' cocksucker.

829
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:54,954
He's gonna cry
like a little baby!

830
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:58,262
You little baby!

831
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:00,929
Hey, Richie!
Hey, Richie!

832
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,132
Oh, Mommy!

833
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,774
Come on.

834
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:17,448
You gotta realize these aren't the kids
you and I grew up with, you know?

835
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,753
Remember in Hebrew school,
when a shoving match was a big deal?

836
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:25,659
Worst-case scenario, somebody
got their yarmulke knocked off.

837
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:31,929
It's true, man.
These guys are no joke.

838
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:35,267
They get all tanked up,
throw a quick fist.

839
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,329
Some of them actually enjoy it.

840
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:40,171
I mean, like, Richie.
What the fuck is that, man?

841
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:42,507
Probably thought I was being
tough back there with that guy.

842
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,576
I was shitting my pants.

843
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:48,174
- I saw that.
- Oh, great. Thanks.

844
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:51,948
These fuckin' Guineas, man.

845
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,547
Half of them do coke.
They all drink. Zero capital.

846
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,388
No fuckin' stability. They
make all this fucking money...

847
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,918
and they're always
living three steps ahead.

848
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:04,262
You know, there's guys who work at the
firm that make a million a year...

849
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:07,497
and they can't even get a fucking
car loan 'cause their credit's so bad.

850
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,970
It's like everybody is just waiting
for the 15th of the month.

851
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,100
They may have a Porsche, but they don't
have ten bucks to put in the gas tank.

852
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:16,111
- No shit.
- It's nigger rich.

853
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:21,179
What is this guy doin'?
Yo!

854
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,786
- All right. Thanks, man.
- Don't forget what I said about Abby.

855
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:37,833
I think she's trouble,
you know?

856
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,062
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

857
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:42,127
I don't know.
I've just worked there a long time.

858
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,639
Just looking out for my friends.

859
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:48,144
I think she's a whore.
Just telling you.

860
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:51,544
Well, it's a good thing
you stopped dating her, then, right?

861
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:54,208
- I'll see you later.
- All right. See you.

862
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:05,309
Of all the people at J.T. Marlin,
you picked this kid, Davis. Why?

863
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:08,687
'Cause he's perfect. He's new,
so his loyalties don't run too deep.

864
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,818
He also seems to be the smartest
of this last group of trainees.

865
00:57:11,894 --> 00:57:15,455
The rest of them are fuckin' idiots
compared to this kid.

866
00:57:15,531 --> 00:57:18,932
He used to run a full-time casino
out of his house in Queens.

867
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:23,700
Now he just picks up the checks.
He'll turn state's, no question.

868
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,502
How are you gonna get to him?

869
00:57:25,574 --> 00:57:27,940
We started surveillance.
We'll get to him.

870
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:42,383
Hey, Jeff!

871
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:45,018
Hey, Jeff, get up here!

872
00:57:52,768 --> 00:57:54,702
What's goin' on?

873
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:58,763
One week I can understand,
but it's approaching five weeks now...

874
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:02,368
and the profits are down 40% since
the last week I was here full-time.

875
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:05,778
I'm not you. I'm not gonna
fuckin' kill myself for half the profit.

876
00:58:05,848 --> 00:58:09,249
You get to come in here and just pick up
your fuckin' money, and it sucks.

877
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:11,149
What?

878
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:15,486
Hey! Hey, you know what?
This is my business.

879
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:17,719
You used to make
ten dollars an hour.

880
00:58:17,793 --> 00:58:21,058
Now you're making 1,000 a week,
and you're still not happy?

881
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:25,260
- What the fuck is going on?
- Nothin'. You can check the tapes.

882
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:27,393
For what? I didn't say anything.
Are you skimming?

883
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,928
No! No, I'm not skimming,
all right?

884
00:58:31,006 --> 00:58:33,167
I can't handle a 24-hour gig
all by myself.

885
00:58:33,242 --> 00:58:35,642
This isn't fuckin' Denny's.

886
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:37,906
You know? I'm tryin'
to finish school here, man.

887
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,778
All right. All right, so...
Look, why don't you do this?

888
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,216
Why don't you take on
another partner...

889
00:58:43,285 --> 00:58:49,019
and you can split your share
with him, which I'll up to 65%...

890
00:58:49,091 --> 00:58:52,185
and then you can go to school
during the day and work at night.

891
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:55,822
I'm already doin' that.

892
00:58:55,898 --> 00:58:59,356
- You are?
- Yeah.

893
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,300
I took Dave on
last month.

894
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:04,533
And you still can't
fuckin' handle it?

895
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:07,701
- It's a lot of work.
- Fuck!

896
00:59:07,776 --> 00:59:09,971
Fuck.

897
00:59:10,045 --> 00:59:12,275
All right, that's it.
It's over.

898
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:14,782
I'm shutting it down.

899
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:20,618
<i>And get those kids</i>
<i>out of my fuckin'house.</i>

900
00:59:20,756 --> 00:59:25,819
By delaying, you simply restrict
my ability to do my job.

901
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,886
<i>Am I? I'm not trying to...</i>

902
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:31,194
Look, I didn't get to where I am today
by losing my clients' money.

903
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:35,670
Put your confidence
in myself and J.T. Marlin...

904
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,298
and I'm telling you,
we'll never have to ask for it again.

905
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:42,538
Put your confidence in myself
and J.T. Marlin...

906
00:59:42,611 --> 00:59:45,876
and I'm telling you, you will
never have to ask for it again.

907
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:52,019
<i>Okay, let's do this.</i>

908
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:55,123
Great. I'm gonna pass you on
to my secretary.

909
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:57,853
You call me when
the stock doubles, all right?

910
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,725
Sheryl, make it so, baby!

911
01:00:00,796 --> 01:00:02,730
<i>All right. So I got into it.</i>

912
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:05,266
<i>Do you know how good it feels</i>
<i>to close someone?</i>

913
01:00:05,334 --> 01:00:08,963
<i>To sell someone?</i>
<i>It's amazing.</i>

914
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:13,099
- What's goin' on?
- Seth just closed a guy for ten large.

915
01:00:13,175 --> 01:00:15,769
- Amazing.
- Do you see what...

916
01:00:15,844 --> 01:00:18,608
You're one of us now.

917
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,911
You popped your cherry!

918
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:25,682
- Hey, Seth, come here a second.
- Yeah. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

919
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:32,855
- I just closed a huge account for you.
- Come here.

920
01:00:32,928 --> 01:00:34,793
What are you doing?
Get away from me.

921
01:00:34,863 --> 01:00:36,421
What the fuck are you doing?

922
01:00:36,498 --> 01:00:38,932
- What is this? Huh?
- What?

923
01:00:39,001 --> 01:00:40,969
Who told you you could
close your own accounts?

924
01:00:41,036 --> 01:00:44,369
- What?
- You violated an S.E.C. Regulation.

925
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,533
You're a fucking trainee.

926
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:49,703
You know, I just figured
I'd take the initiative...

927
01:00:49,778 --> 01:00:52,212
and, you know,
make you some money.

928
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:55,045
Greg, I was standing right next
to him the whole time.

929
01:00:55,117 --> 01:00:57,585
I would've stepped right in if the kid
would have gotten in trouble.

930
01:00:57,653 --> 01:01:00,816
You got a cannoli you can
stick in your mouth?

931
01:01:00,889 --> 01:01:03,119
No, you got a menorah
you can shove in your ass?

932
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:05,126
Fuck him. Come on.

933
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:07,992
I don't even give a fuck
about the money, okay?

934
01:01:08,063 --> 01:01:09,894
Do you know what would happen...

935
01:01:09,965 --> 01:01:12,627
if every trainee started
handling their own recos?

936
01:01:12,701 --> 01:01:16,569
- The shop would be closed in a week.
- Is this about something else?

937
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,630
What would that be?

938
01:01:22,244 --> 01:01:24,303
Great.

939
01:01:26,048 --> 01:01:28,414
Don't you have to go
answer the phones or something?

940
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:34,855
You know what? Fuck it.
We'll deal with this later.

941
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:42,228
Don't tell me that's why
I'm not hitting it anymore.

942
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:45,062
Oh, honey, you were
never hitting it...

943
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:47,159
and he's not
the reason, Greg.

944
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:49,170
You are.

945
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:42,516
Jesus Christ,
they're all the same.

946
01:02:42,591 --> 01:02:45,719
- What's the same?
- Oh, my God.

947
01:02:45,794 --> 01:02:47,523
You scared me.

948
01:02:47,596 --> 01:02:50,156
I'm sorry.

949
01:02:50,232 --> 01:02:52,393
How long have you
been standing there?

950
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:56,199
I just walked up. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

951
01:02:56,271 --> 01:03:00,037
No, no, that's all right.
Interesting reading?

952
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,704
This? No, this is just
the prospectus...

953
01:03:03,779 --> 01:03:06,714
from the last I.P.O.
The firm put out.

954
01:03:06,782 --> 01:03:11,344
I know what it is. I was just asking
if you thought it was interesting.

955
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,878
You know, you might be the first person
to read a J.T. Prospectus.

956
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,118
Really?

957
01:03:17,192 --> 01:03:20,127
Yeah. So, what are
you looking for?

958
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:22,959
I'm just looking for
some chocolate love.

959
01:03:26,268 --> 01:03:29,465
You know what? Would you like me
to practice my pitch?

960
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:32,666
- 'Cause I know it turns you on.
- Oh, God.

961
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:42,483
<i>You know, I saw John Feiner...</i>

962
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:45,952
<i>shredding a bunch of documents</i>
<i>the other day.</i>

963
01:03:46,021 --> 01:03:48,046
<i>You don't think that's weird?</i>

964
01:03:48,123 --> 01:03:51,581
You say you like the hard sell
and the money.

965
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,594
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

966
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:57,962
And then you question it the minute
you see something a bit off.

967
01:04:00,202 --> 01:04:02,568
No, I'm serious.
Either you need to admit to yourself...

968
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:06,904
that it's not charity work
and enjoy it, or get out.

969
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:13,971
But you cannot keep going back
and forth like this. It's ridiculous.

970
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:24,286
<i>Can you buy a bigger bed</i>
<i>when you get some money, please?</i>

971
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:27,385
<i>How big is your bed?</i>
<i>Bigger than this one.</i>

972
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:30,694
<i>You have a huge bed?</i>

973
01:04:34,703 --> 01:04:37,672
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Harry. Seth Davis at J. T. Marlin.</i>

974
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:39,673
- <i>How are you doing this morning?</i>
- Fine, thanks.

975
01:04:39,741 --> 01:04:41,675
You got a call from
an associate last month.

976
01:04:41,743 --> 01:04:43,938
I wanted to know if you enjoyed
the information we sent you.

977
01:04:44,012 --> 01:04:46,503
What information?

978
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:48,846
If you get as much mail as I do,
you probably brushed it aside.

979
01:04:48,917 --> 01:04:52,114
But more importantly, we made
a commitment to get back to you.

980
01:04:52,187 --> 01:04:55,315
Listen, I'm presenting you with
an investment opportunity...

981
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:57,153
<i>that I think you'll find interesting.</i>

982
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,853
I'm not in the market for that.

983
01:04:58,927 --> 01:05:01,828
Tell me, Harry, are you married
or are you happy?

984
01:05:01,897 --> 01:05:04,388
Actually, I've been married
for ten years.

985
01:05:04,466 --> 01:05:07,299
Oh, yeah? That's great.
Yeah, six years for me.

986
01:05:07,369 --> 01:05:10,770
So, listen. Are you
playing the market at all?

987
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:13,774
I don't know about playing.
I do own some blue chips.

988
01:05:13,842 --> 01:05:16,242
They were actually
wedding gifts from friends.

989
01:05:16,311 --> 01:05:19,872
Listen, we have an explosive situation
going on right now.

990
01:05:19,948 --> 01:05:21,916
A pharmaceutical company,
Farrow Tech...

991
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:25,943
has a drug called Parattin
in the third stage of F.D.A. Approval.

992
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:27,955
- What's it do?
- <i>That's a good question.</i>

993
01:05:28,023 --> 01:05:30,423
That's a very good question,
and this is the best part.

994
01:05:30,492 --> 01:05:32,687
It helps premature babies
develop properly.

995
01:05:32,761 --> 01:05:34,729
- That sounds like a good drug.
- It is. It is.

996
01:05:34,796 --> 01:05:38,892
So, those blue chips you own, what have
they done since you got married?

997
01:05:38,967 --> 01:05:42,095
- Not that much, really.
- We deal in stocks that really move.

998
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:44,570
Oh, yeah.
They really move.

999
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,599
I'd love to show you what I mean,
and I can do so on a small investment.

1000
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:50,611
I really can't
buy anything right now.

1001
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:53,045
My wife and I are getting ready
to buy a house this month...

1002
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,879
and we're trying to save
every last penny.

1003
01:05:55,951 --> 01:05:58,442
Look, I don't care
how much stock you pick up.

1004
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,181
I just want you to test me out.

1005
01:06:00,255 --> 01:06:03,247
I want you to judge me
on the percentages I show you.

1006
01:06:03,325 --> 01:06:06,556
I show you 30 or 40%, no matter how big
or small your position is...

1007
01:06:06,628 --> 01:06:10,029
you're gonna get excited
about my next idea, right?

1008
01:06:10,098 --> 01:06:12,362
- Yeah.
- You'd hand out my business cards.

1009
01:06:12,434 --> 01:06:16,803
Right? Do this:
Pick up a hundred shares.

1010
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,272
It's the absolute firm minimum.
If I show you...

1011
01:06:19,341 --> 01:06:21,468
three or four points on the trade,
it's not gonna make you rich.

1012
01:06:21,543 --> 01:06:24,103
On the same token,
if the stock doesn't go anywhere...

1013
01:06:24,179 --> 01:06:26,113
you're not in front of your store
with a cup in your hand.

1014
01:06:26,181 --> 01:06:29,548
- No, that's true.
- Look, the truth of the matter is...

1015
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:32,109
I could sell you more
than 100 shares...

1016
01:06:32,187 --> 01:06:34,052
<i>and feel completely</i>
<i>comfortable about the trade.</i>

1017
01:06:34,122 --> 01:06:38,491
But I'm asking you to start small
just to prove what I can do for you.

1018
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:42,730
All right.
Let's try it.

1019
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:46,256
Great. Should I send the confirmation
to your business or your home?

1020
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,428
I need to talk to my wife.

1021
01:06:48,503 --> 01:06:50,596
No, you don't need to do that.
I'll call you right back.

1022
01:06:50,672 --> 01:06:53,641
- I'm goin' to lunch in five minutes.
- I need to talk to her first.

1023
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:56,041
- Harry, you're at work, aren't you?
- Yeah.

1024
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:57,772
What do you do for a living?

1025
01:06:57,846 --> 01:07:00,747
I'm a purchasing manager
at a gourmet foods company.

1026
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:03,512
- <i>Does yourjob involve decisions?</i>
- Of course.

1027
01:07:03,585 --> 01:07:06,850
When you're making decisions, do you
call your wife and ask her what to do?

1028
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:08,856
Of course not.
But that's a little different.

1029
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:11,791
How is that different?
It's your money. You earned it.

1030
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:15,227
All you're doing is investing it.
I'm not selling crack here.

1031
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:16,992
<i>She's only gonna be happy...</i>

1032
01:07:17,065 --> 01:07:19,397
when she sees that you made
a wise investment for the family.

1033
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,629
Just think of the flip side.
When your wife does the shopping...

1034
01:07:21,703 --> 01:07:25,002
does she call you to find out if she can
use a coupon for Cap'n Crunch?

1035
01:07:25,073 --> 01:07:28,634
- Now, come on. That's not being fair.
- <i>No, I know.</i>

1036
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:33,113
Look, Harry. I'm just trying
to make a point here.

1037
01:07:33,181 --> 01:07:36,776
Look, we're not talking about
a lot of money here.

1038
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:41,312
Just think what she'll say when you
bring home a big fat check...

1039
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:45,850
<i>because you had the foresight</i>
<i>to see a good thing coming.</i>

1040
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:51,523
- All right. Let's try it.
- <i>Good man, Harry.</i>

1041
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,830
You made a great decision,
all right?

1042
01:07:53,902 --> 01:07:57,167
Hold on a second.
Do it.

1043
01:07:59,808 --> 01:08:02,038
<i>Hello?</i>

1044
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:04,704
- <i>Yo.</i>
- <i>Hey, what's up?</i>

1045
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,271
You passed the Series Seven.
Decide where we're celebrating tonight.

1046
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:11,376
I was thinking that we should
go to the city tonight...

1047
01:08:11,453 --> 01:08:13,785
'cause we're always drinking
at those shitty local bars.

1048
01:08:13,855 --> 01:08:16,983
I think we should go to
a decent bar with some decent poo-poo.

1049
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:19,653
If I have to look at one more
housewife smoking a Newport...

1050
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,719
I think I'm gonna puke.

1051
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:24,732
<i>Let me round up the guys.</i>
<i>We'll come pick you up.</i>

1052
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,597
- All right.
- <i>You got it.</i>

1053
01:08:26,668 --> 01:08:28,101
Okay, bye.

1054
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:33,198
This guy probably got more rooms
in there than he's ever even been in.

1055
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,903
Look at it.
It's fuckin' huge.

1056
01:08:35,977 --> 01:08:39,003
Hey, Chris, why do you
still live with your mother?

1057
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:41,015
What do you mean?

1058
01:08:51,226 --> 01:08:54,684
Do you ever wonder
how we make the rips that we do?

1059
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:59,598
How is it that we make rips
that pay out...

1060
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:01,636
more than any other
major firm?

1061
01:09:01,703 --> 01:09:04,797
You're kidding me, right?

1062
01:09:04,873 --> 01:09:06,465
That's the wrong...

1063
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:08,941
That's the wrong question
to be asking.

1064
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:11,274
- Why?
- The only thing to worry about...

1065
01:09:11,346 --> 01:09:13,780
is how you're gonna
get laid tonight.

1066
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,952
No, I'm serious.

1067
01:09:18,019 --> 01:09:20,749
Don't you know that
S.E.C. Regulations state...

1068
01:09:20,822 --> 01:09:24,258
that the maximum rip allowed
is five percent of the sale...

1069
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:26,794
and we're making, like,
four times that?

1070
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:32,300
You just passed your Series Seven;
now you're an inspector or something?

1071
01:09:32,367 --> 01:09:35,302
- Aren't you happy with things?
- Yeah, of course.

1072
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:38,203
No, I'm just curious.
You're not curious?

1073
01:09:38,273 --> 01:09:41,674
Not at all.
I like being a millionaire.

1074
01:09:41,743 --> 01:09:45,338
And you will too,
believe me.

1075
01:09:45,413 --> 01:09:48,871
- What's up?
- You need help?

1076
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:51,418
- With what?
- Getting into the fuckin' child's seat.

1077
01:09:51,486 --> 01:09:53,420
Come on.
Shotgun.

1078
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:00,828
Why did the feminist
cross the road?

1079
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:03,831
To suck my fuckin' cock.

1080
01:10:05,233 --> 01:10:08,464
- That's funny.
- Damn straight.

1081
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:11,335
- Order me another one.
- Who U.A.T.'d this beer for me?

1082
01:10:11,406 --> 01:10:14,341
- I did. What's up?
- I hate it. Send the shit back.

1083
01:10:14,409 --> 01:10:17,401
- What's a U.A. T?
- Unauthorized trade.

1084
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,709
Seth, anything killing you yet?

1085
01:10:19,781 --> 01:10:23,877
All right, yeah.
You know what I fuckin' hate?

1086
01:10:23,952 --> 01:10:28,013
Is getting past the secretaries.
It doesn't matter if you're a broker.

1087
01:10:28,089 --> 01:10:31,650
It's still a sales call,
and they fuckin' know that.

1088
01:10:31,726 --> 01:10:34,320
- One day I'm gonna open a firm.
- Hold on a second.

1089
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:35,954
You're opening things now?

1090
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,022
Kid just passed his test;
now he knows everything.

1091
01:10:38,099 --> 01:10:42,001
What's wrong with you? You haven't
even popped your cherry yet.

1092
01:10:45,807 --> 01:10:48,173
Hey, whatever.
Let's toast the slut. Here you go.

1093
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:51,542
Bring it up for the kid.
Highest Series Seven score this month.

1094
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:55,146
Big swinging dick,
enjoy it while it lasts.

1095
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,480
Do you guys think you could
just try and keep it down some?

1096
01:11:01,556 --> 01:11:05,253
You guys are at a ten.
We could use you at a two.

1097
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,420
- You got to be kidding me.
- I'm sorry about that.

1098
01:11:07,495 --> 01:11:11,761
Why don't you just concentrate
on your food instead of us, all right?

1099
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:14,700
What are you guys eating?
A tube steak smothered in underwear?

1100
01:11:19,674 --> 01:11:21,437
Hey, great outfits.

1101
01:11:21,509 --> 01:11:23,443
You guys coming from
a city council meeting...

1102
01:11:23,511 --> 01:11:26,071
or are you trying to get lucky
with the bridge-and-tunnel crowd?

1103
01:11:26,147 --> 01:11:29,207
You tell 'em, girl.

1104
01:11:29,284 --> 01:11:31,445
You know what they should do
with you guys?

1105
01:11:31,519 --> 01:11:34,920
They should throw all of you
on a fucking island somewhere.

1106
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:37,618
- Oh, yeah. Hey, guess what.
- What?

1107
01:11:37,692 --> 01:11:40,525
You're on it.

1108
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,462
He got a point.

1109
01:11:44,532 --> 01:11:47,092
Way to go, girl.

1110
01:11:47,168 --> 01:11:49,693
Here you go.

1111
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:57,878
You take it.

1112
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,878
Hey, Harry,
who's J.T. Marlin?

1113
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:05,579
I forgot to tell you.
I bought a little bit of stock.

1114
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,282
What'd you buy?

1115
01:12:08,356 --> 01:12:10,551
It's this pharmaceutical company.
It's poised for a big jump.

1116
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:13,025
They make a new drug that helps...

1117
01:12:13,094 --> 01:12:15,255
premature babies
survive the first three months.

1118
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:18,026
That's great.
Yeah, that's great.

1119
01:12:18,099 --> 01:12:22,661
- So how much did you buy?
- Nothing crazy. Just 100 shares.

1120
01:12:22,737 --> 01:12:26,002
- At what price?
- Eight dollars. It's okay. Relax.

1121
01:12:26,074 --> 01:12:30,272
Okay. So, how'd you
even know who to call?

1122
01:12:30,345 --> 01:12:33,075
- Actually, he called me.
- Who did?

1123
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:35,639
Seth Davis, the broker.

1124
01:12:35,717 --> 01:12:38,914
He's a really great guy.
He's a family man, actually.

1125
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:41,683
How did he
get your name?

1126
01:12:41,756 --> 01:12:44,020
- I have no idea.
- Doesn't that worry you?

1127
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:46,959
It's just... It's okay.
Relax, all right?

1128
01:12:47,028 --> 01:12:49,121
- Okay.
- It's a small investment.

1129
01:12:49,197 --> 01:12:51,665
And I'm just
testing this guy out.

1130
01:12:51,733 --> 01:12:56,102
If he doesn't show us any gains,
I won't do business with him again.

1131
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:58,105
Okay.

1132
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:01,470
<i>I don't know why the hell</i>
<i>I walked in there.</i>

1133
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,477
<i>Things were going well for me.</i>

1134
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:07,311
<i>I had passed the Series Seven</i>
<i>and was closing my 40 accounts for Greg.</i>

1135
01:13:07,382 --> 01:13:09,942
<i>I didn't wanna go in.</i>
<i>I really didn't.</i>

1136
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:13,852
<i>But part of me had to know what Michael</i>
<i>was doing in there the week before.</i>

1137
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:16,356
<i>And why would they be walking</i>
<i>into the building next door?</i>

1138
01:13:16,424 --> 01:13:18,517
<i>The place was empty.</i>

1139
01:13:18,593 --> 01:13:20,561
<i>I should've just let it go.</i>

1140
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:32,529
- Do we have parking?
- Again? Why?

1141
01:13:32,607 --> 01:13:35,508
I want the garage.

1142
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:38,512
Do we have the same
security guy or what?

1143
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,514
- Are these hooked up?
- Yeah. All that stuff.

1144
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:43,915
If the heat comes and we have to jump,
how long will it take to move the firm?

1145
01:13:43,985 --> 01:13:46,579
- Under two hours, literally.
- Everything.

1146
01:13:46,654 --> 01:13:49,589
- They'll can make calls that afternoon.
- Okay.

1147
01:13:49,657 --> 01:13:52,820
All right. I gotta get back
to that phone call, but...

1148
01:13:52,894 --> 01:13:56,125
<i>My first thought was that we</i>
<i>were moving to nicer offices.</i>

1149
01:13:56,197 --> 01:13:57,721
<i>Nice thought.</i>

1150
01:13:57,799 --> 01:14:01,860
<i>I came to realize it was a quick out</i>
<i>for Michael if things got out of hand.</i>

1151
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:15,648
Miss Halprin. Special Agent Drew, F.B.I.
This is Agent Etkin.

1152
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:18,982
We'd like to talk to you about
your relationship with Seth Davis...

1153
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:21,488
and about your mother's health.

1154
01:14:25,026 --> 01:14:27,221
<i>Didn't take me long</i>
<i>to close the 40 accounts.</i>

1155
01:14:27,295 --> 01:14:30,787
<i>I was closing five a day, sometimes six.</i>
<i>Just killing it.</i>

1156
01:14:30,865 --> 01:14:33,459
<i>Greg certainly didn't</i>
<i>make it easy, though.</i>

1157
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,059
<i>But I was focused.</i>

1158
01:14:35,136 --> 01:14:37,764
<i>I was about to start making</i>
<i>the serious dough.</i>

1159
01:14:37,839 --> 01:14:40,467
<i>I was about to be on my own.</i>

1160
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:43,739
<i>All right. At the house.</i>
<i>Sheryl. Yes!</i>

1161
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,303
My first whale. My first account.
My book, baby.

1162
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:50,613
Seth, I hate to bust in
on your little victory speech...

1163
01:14:50,685 --> 01:14:53,552
but that's your 40th account.

1164
01:14:53,621 --> 01:14:56,988
I'm out of the junior broker program.
I don't work for you no more.

1165
01:14:57,058 --> 01:15:01,927
That's true. You're out,
but that account's mine.

1166
01:15:04,232 --> 01:15:06,166
What? Fuck that.
No, I keep the 40th.

1167
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:10,061
- No, you don't.
- What?

1168
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:13,107
Wait a minute.
Is this about Abby?

1169
01:15:13,174 --> 01:15:16,234
Are you that
fucking bitter?

1170
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:18,108
I made a lot of money for you
in the past three months.

1171
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:20,443
More than any other trainee.

1172
01:15:20,515 --> 01:15:23,951
You're not listening to me, all right?
I couldn't do it if I wanted to.

1173
01:15:24,018 --> 01:15:26,578
What... Rules are rules, man.

1174
01:15:26,654 --> 01:15:29,487
Oh, man!

1175
01:15:29,557 --> 01:15:32,651
Don't be a dick.
You know you can bend the rules.

1176
01:15:32,727 --> 01:15:35,025
I gave each one of my guys their 40th.
Come on.

1177
01:15:35,096 --> 01:15:38,998
Do me a favor. Shut your fucking mouth.
Okay? I'm not talking to you.

1178
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:41,865
You know what? Fuck you.
Fuck you!

1179
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,812
You're on my team.
You understand that?

1180
01:15:52,914 --> 01:15:56,008
I am not on yours.

1181
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:58,279
Don't you ever
forget that, bitch.

1182
01:16:21,142 --> 01:16:24,009
How's everybody doing?

1183
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:28,244
I wanted to congratulate
you all on a huge month.

1184
01:16:28,316 --> 01:16:29,908
For any of you
not yet convinced...

1185
01:16:29,984 --> 01:16:35,081
these were the top dogs of the month:
Jim Young, $280,000;

1186
01:16:35,156 --> 01:16:38,148
Chris Varick, $205,000;

1187
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:41,195
and Greg Weinstein, $190,000.

1188
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:45,389
This month's gonna be bigger.

1189
01:16:45,466 --> 01:16:48,230
It's actually gonna be
the biggest month we ever had.

1190
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:53,837
I got a new issue I wanna
talk to you about. Okay?

1191
01:16:53,908 --> 01:16:55,705
It's called Med Patent.

1192
01:16:57,178 --> 01:17:00,443
They just designed the world's
first retractable syringe.

1193
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:04,076
That means that nurses
and doctors will never again...

1194
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:06,780
have to worry about infection
from dirty needles.

1195
01:17:06,854 --> 01:17:10,255
This is not going to be an alternative
in the medical world.

1196
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:12,759
This is gonna be the standard.

1197
01:17:12,827 --> 01:17:16,786
We all know that we're here
to make money.

1198
01:17:16,864 --> 01:17:19,731
But if we can do something good
like this, it's all the better.

1199
01:17:21,369 --> 01:17:23,394
So I want you to go out...

1200
01:17:23,471 --> 01:17:27,532
and buy yourselves
a new car.

1201
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:30,942
Go buy yourself a house.
Go into debt.

1202
01:17:31,012 --> 01:17:33,947
You are gonna make a million dollars
inside of six months.

1203
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:42,586
Now onto matters of recreation.
We're gonna take a class trip tonight.

1204
01:17:44,058 --> 01:17:47,755
So call your moms
and tell them not to wait up!

1205
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:11,444
We're players now, boys!
Let's celebrate! Salute!

1206
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:34,364
What's wrong?

1207
01:18:34,442 --> 01:18:36,376
Nothin'.

1208
01:18:37,445 --> 01:18:39,504
Seth, I know you.

1209
01:18:40,581 --> 01:18:42,947
Just work.

1210
01:18:44,018 --> 01:18:46,009
It's your father, isn't it?

1211
01:18:46,087 --> 01:18:49,614
No, no, everything's great
with my dad.

1212
01:18:52,093 --> 01:18:55,028
He's taking me out to lunch next week
on his request.

1213
01:18:57,298 --> 01:19:01,530
- Do you know how happy that makes me?
- I do.

1214
01:19:01,602 --> 01:19:04,662
You know... I mean,
it's all based on this job...

1215
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:06,934
this very legitimate,
respectable job...

1216
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:10,603
that he can tell his friends about
during the Yom Kippur appeal.

1217
01:19:12,213 --> 01:19:15,205
But I'll take it.
I mean...

1218
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:17,717
Oh, fuck.

1219
01:19:17,785 --> 01:19:20,982
I'm so fuckin' close.

1220
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:24,285
You know?
And I'm fucking it up.

1221
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:26,418
I mean, l...

1222
01:19:26,494 --> 01:19:28,428
How are you
fucking it up?

1223
01:19:28,496 --> 01:19:32,262
I went to the Med Patent office
this morning, and there isn't one.

1224
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:34,267
It's cardboard.
There's nothing.

1225
01:19:34,335 --> 01:19:36,166
There's no employees.

1226
01:19:36,237 --> 01:19:38,705
There's no research
and development. Nothing.

1227
01:19:38,773 --> 01:19:40,900
I found out how Michael's
making his money.

1228
01:19:40,975 --> 01:19:44,706
We're selling stock
for companies that don't exist.

1229
01:19:46,013 --> 01:19:49,176
- Do you know what bridge financing is?
- No.

1230
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:52,378
Basically,
it's a way to raise capital...

1231
01:19:52,453 --> 01:19:55,422
for a company that's
trying to go public.

1232
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,720
They get money
from outside investors.

1233
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:01,228
They're the bridge.
And it's perfectly legal...

1234
01:20:01,295 --> 01:20:05,231
as long as there's no connection
between the investors and the firm.

1235
01:20:05,299 --> 01:20:09,395
But Michael's fronting his friends
as the investors on every I.P.O. We do.

1236
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:12,439
So that's why all the names
on the contracts are the same.

1237
01:20:14,108 --> 01:20:17,475
Right. Then he has us
push it all on the open market.

1238
01:20:17,545 --> 01:20:19,706
We're basically selling
Michael's shares.

1239
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:21,715
That's where
the two-dollar rips come in.

1240
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:24,718
He can pay us that much,
and it's worth it for him...

1241
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:28,586
because he depends on us
to literally create the market for him.

1242
01:20:28,656 --> 01:20:32,888
There's no other firm selling this shit.
It's all artificial demand.

1243
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,985
As soon as we
sell off his position...

1244
01:20:35,062 --> 01:20:37,997
there's no need to maintain
the inflated price anymore.

1245
01:20:38,065 --> 01:20:41,125
- We stop pushing it, and then...
- And then it crashes.

1246
01:20:41,202 --> 01:20:43,432
Right.

1247
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:47,631
But, I mean, how does that
really affect me?

1248
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:51,576
I'm just selling stock.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1249
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:53,841
So I know now how Michael
makes his own money.

1250
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:55,780
And I know that I'm not working
at Goldman Sachs...

1251
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,340
but we already know that.

1252
01:20:59,086 --> 01:21:01,611
So how does this
really change anything?

1253
01:21:01,689 --> 01:21:05,523
I don't know, Seth.
You tell me.

1254
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,274
What?

1255
01:21:28,616 --> 01:21:31,016
J.T. Marlin.
How may I direct your call?

1256
01:21:31,085 --> 01:21:34,020
<i>I think I'll</i>
<i>just talk to you.</i>

1257
01:21:36,924 --> 01:21:39,620
Why are you
calling me here?

1258
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:43,892
<i>Time's running out, Abby.</i>
<i>I need to know what he's doing.</i>

1259
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:48,402
You know what?
I'm getting a little bit tired of this.

1260
01:21:48,469 --> 01:21:52,098
I don't even know why I talked to you.
You have nothing on me.

1261
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:54,300
I'm gonna hang up
this phone now.

1262
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:56,309
<i>You're putting all</i>
<i>the deals through.</i>

1263
01:21:56,377 --> 01:21:59,574
<i>Your signature's on every sell ticket.</i>
<i>So go ahead, hang up.</i>

1264
01:21:59,647 --> 01:22:02,514
<i>We'll send a car over for you</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

1265
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:10,187
Goddamn it,
you fuckin' guys!

1266
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:12,192
I'm gonna
keep this short, okay?

1267
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,194
You passed your Sevens
over a month ago.

1268
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:17,322
Seth's the only one that's opened
40 accounts for his team leader.

1269
01:22:17,398 --> 01:22:20,265
When I was a junior broker,
I did it in 26 days. Okay?

1270
01:22:20,334 --> 01:22:23,269
You're not sending out
press packets anymore.

1271
01:22:23,337 --> 01:22:25,601
None of this " Debbie the
Time-Life operator" bullshit.

1272
01:22:25,673 --> 01:22:27,868
So get on the phones!
It's time to get to work!

1273
01:22:27,942 --> 01:22:31,708
Get off your ass! Move around!
Motion creates emotion!

1274
01:22:31,779 --> 01:22:34,680
I remember one time I had this guy
call me up, wanted to pitch me.

1275
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:38,116
Right?
Wanted to sell me stock, so I let him.

1276
01:22:38,185 --> 01:22:40,085
I got every fuckin' rebuttal
out of this guy.

1277
01:22:40,154 --> 01:22:42,088
Kept him on the phone
for an hour and half.

1278
01:22:42,156 --> 01:22:45,648
Towards the end, I asked him questions
like, "What's the firm minimum?"

1279
01:22:45,726 --> 01:22:48,923
That's a buying question. Right there,
that guy's gotta take me down.

1280
01:22:48,996 --> 01:22:52,056
It's not like "What's your 800 number?"
That's a fuck-off question.

1281
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:54,931
I was giving him a run,
and he blew it.

1282
01:22:55,002 --> 01:22:57,163
To a question like,
"What is the firm minimum?"

1283
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:59,604
The answer is zero.

1284
01:22:59,674 --> 01:23:01,539
You don't like the idea;
don't pick up a single share.

1285
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:04,305
But this putz is telling me,
you know, "Uh, 100 shares."

1286
01:23:04,378 --> 01:23:06,403
Wrong answer! No!

1287
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,880
You have
to be closing all the time!

1288
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:11,009
And be aggressive.
Learn how to push.

1289
01:23:11,085 --> 01:23:13,110
Talk to 'em.
Ask 'em questions.

1290
01:23:13,187 --> 01:23:15,246
Ask 'em rhetorical questions.
It doesn't matter.

1291
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:17,314
Anything.
Just get a "yes" out of 'em.

1292
01:23:17,391 --> 01:23:21,088
"If you're drowning and I throw a
life jacket, would you grab it?" " Yes!"

1293
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:24,097
"Good. Pick up 200 shares.
I won't let you down."

1294
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:27,396
Ask 'em how they'd like to see
30, 40% returns.

1295
01:23:27,468 --> 01:23:29,402
What are they gonna say?
"No"? "Fuck you"?

1296
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:32,928
"I don't wanna see those returns"?
Stop laughing. It's not funny.

1297
01:23:33,007 --> 01:23:37,137
If you can't learn to close, you better
start thinking about another career.

1298
01:23:37,211 --> 01:23:40,271
And I am deadly serious about that.
Dead fuckin' serious!

1299
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:42,282
And have your rebuttals ready.

1300
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,841
A guy says, "Call me tomorrow"?
Bullshit!

1301
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:49,117
Somebody tells you they got money
problems buying 200 shares is lying.

1302
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,317
You know what I say to that?

1303
01:23:51,392 --> 01:23:54,293
I say, " Look, man.
Tell me you don't like my firm.

1304
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:57,820
Tell me you don't like my idea.
Tell me you don't like my necktie.

1305
01:23:57,898 --> 01:24:01,766
But don't tell me you can't
put together 2,500 bucks."

1306
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:05,033
And there is no such thing
as a no-sale call.

1307
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:07,506
A sale is made
on every call you make.

1308
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:12,638
Either you sell the client some stock,
or he sells you on a reason he can't.

1309
01:24:12,713 --> 01:24:15,341
Either way, a sale is made.

1310
01:24:15,416 --> 01:24:18,783
The only question is,
"Who's gonna close?" You or him?

1311
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:23,187
And be relentless.
That's it. I'm done.

1312
01:24:23,257 --> 01:24:26,522
When I say this man was a loser,
I was saying to myself...

1313
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:29,495
"What are you doing getting
involved with a divorc?"

1314
01:24:29,563 --> 01:24:32,225
It didn't work the first time, it won't
work the second. That's your phone.

1315
01:24:32,299 --> 01:24:34,563
- I should let you go. I'll scoot.
- Yes?

1316
01:24:34,635 --> 01:24:37,570
- <i>Hi, Harry. How you doing?</i>
- Seth, did you get my calls?

1317
01:24:37,638 --> 01:24:39,868
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's just been crazy around here.

1318
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:43,637
What's happening with Farrow Tech?
It's down five points.

1319
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:47,044
I think we should...

1320
01:24:47,114 --> 01:24:49,639
- I wanna sell it.
- You wanna sell now? The stock's down.

1321
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:52,083
You don't make money
buying high and selling low.

1322
01:24:52,219 --> 01:24:56,849
So what's going on?
Tell me why we shouldn't get out now.

1323
01:24:56,924 --> 01:24:58,585
All right. Here's the deal.

1324
01:24:58,659 --> 01:25:01,355
I told you things would happen
in 60 days. It's only been 20 so far.

1325
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:04,364
The situation here is explosive,
and I wanted to get you involved.

1326
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:09,563
I've been busy gathering information.
The stock's down for tech reasons.

1327
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:12,367
It just came off the restricted list,
but it's still the same company.

1328
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:16,604
As a matter of fact, Farrow's been doing
nothing but signing more contracts.

1329
01:25:16,677 --> 01:25:19,339
- It's looking like our next big one.
- Guys, listen up.

1330
01:25:20,614 --> 01:25:22,878
Harry, I'm sorry.
Can you hold on a second?

1331
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:26,078
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

1332
01:25:26,153 --> 01:25:27,643
I just got word from Michael.

1333
01:25:27,722 --> 01:25:29,519
The rip on Farrow Tech
is now three dollars.

1334
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:34,527
Harry, listen to this.

1335
01:25:36,597 --> 01:25:39,065
Jesus Christ.
What's going on over there?

1336
01:25:39,133 --> 01:25:42,068
See what I'm saying? People know!
The whole place is going nuts.

1337
01:25:42,136 --> 01:25:46,072
It's already up a point, and it just
came off the restricted list.

1338
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:49,576
I'm advising all my clients
to get in on this, and heavy.

1339
01:25:49,643 --> 01:25:52,441
You get the same stock we picked up
at eight, only now it's at four.

1340
01:25:52,513 --> 01:25:55,744
- When it was at 8, I said it'd go to 20.
- Yes, you did.

1341
01:25:55,816 --> 01:25:58,751
It's still going there, probably higher.
This doesn't change anything...

1342
01:25:58,819 --> 01:26:01,083
except you're making more money
than you did before.

1343
01:26:01,155 --> 01:26:03,316
I liked it at eight. I love it at four.
It's an average down for you.

1344
01:26:03,390 --> 01:26:05,551
- A what?
- It's called dollar-cost averaging.

1345
01:26:05,626 --> 01:26:08,652
If you own 100 shares at 10 dollars,
and you pick up another 100 at 5...

1346
01:26:08,729 --> 01:26:10,788
that's 200 shares
at 7.50 a share.

1347
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:12,856
If I get you involved at 10,
I take you out at 15...

1348
01:26:12,933 --> 01:26:14,662
how many points did I make you?

1349
01:26:14,735 --> 01:26:17,226
- Five.
- Exactly. But at seven and a <i>half...</i>

1350
01:26:17,304 --> 01:26:19,238
if I take you out at 15,
that's 71/2 points.

1351
01:26:19,306 --> 01:26:21,968
- That's better, isn't it?
- Yeah, but l...

1352
01:26:22,042 --> 01:26:24,169
Let me close the door
to my office. One second.

1353
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:30,511
I also have a bullet on it.
A few days ago, Dan Dorfman on CNBC...

1354
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:33,314
put a heavy buy recommendation
on Farrow Tech.

1355
01:26:33,387 --> 01:26:37,323
Listen to me. I just called
a broker friend at another firm...

1356
01:26:37,391 --> 01:26:40,758
and had him pick me up 50,000 shares
under my sister-in-law's name.

1357
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:43,592
I'm gonna put all my kids
through college with this stock.

1358
01:26:43,664 --> 01:26:46,292
I have 1,000 more calls to make.

1359
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:50,269
I have to call every one of my clients
and give 'em the same opportunity.

1360
01:26:50,337 --> 01:26:52,771
You remember when we first spoke?
I told you that this firm...

1361
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,774
only has six or seven
great ideas a year?

1362
01:26:54,842 --> 01:26:57,037
Well, this is one
of those ideas.

1363
01:26:57,111 --> 01:27:00,012
I remember you saying something
about wanting to buy a house, right?

1364
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,104
Yeah.

1365
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:04,879
<i>How'd you like to pay for it</i>
<i>tomorrow in cash?</i>

1366
01:27:05,986 --> 01:27:09,114
- Are you serious?
- Serious as cancer.

1367
01:27:10,624 --> 01:27:13,058
Okay, all I have is...

1368
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:16,290
the 50,000
from our savings account.

1369
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:21,231
Seth, you got a call
on line three.

1370
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:25,033
Look, that's my secretary.
I have to go.

1371
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:28,909
What's it gonna be,
Harry?

1372
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,850
This kid is really good.

1373
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:42,088
God, he's gonna
go down hard.

1374
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:44,750
You think I wanna live in this apartment
the rest of my life?

1375
01:27:44,825 --> 01:27:46,520
Sometimes I wonder.

1376
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:48,721
I'm the one that got the raise.
Try and remember that.

1377
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:52,926
- I'm the one that goes out every day...
- You can't keep using that.

1378
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,298
I've told you a million times
that I will get a job.

1379
01:27:55,369 --> 01:27:57,496
But you forbid it,
then you use it against me.

1380
01:27:57,571 --> 01:27:59,129
We'll buy the house!

1381
01:27:59,206 --> 01:28:01,174
With what?
That was our savings, remember?

1382
01:28:01,242 --> 01:28:03,870
The stock's gonna go up!
Seth promised!

1383
01:28:03,944 --> 01:28:06,845
No, get out of it.
Sell it all tomorrow morning.

1384
01:28:18,425 --> 01:28:22,327
I spoke to Howard Goldberg
over at Prudential.

1385
01:28:22,396 --> 01:28:26,628
You lied again,
you unbelievable piece of shit.

1386
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:29,794
You lied to all of us.

1387
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:32,338
He told me
about J.T. Marlin.

1388
01:28:34,541 --> 01:28:37,237
It's a chop shop, Seth.

1389
01:28:37,311 --> 01:28:41,407
You've been selling
their shit all this time.

1390
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:44,883
How many people have you fucked over?
Tell me. How many?

1391
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:46,852
All that bullshit
about them...

1392
01:28:46,921 --> 01:28:49,014
wanting you to know
how the business works.

1393
01:28:49,089 --> 01:28:51,751
The great training program,
remember?

1394
01:28:51,825 --> 01:28:56,228
All the profits you made
for your customers?

1395
01:28:56,297 --> 01:29:00,893
Did you do anything for them?
Did you make them any money at all?

1396
01:29:04,071 --> 01:29:06,904
Oh, God. I'm done with you, Seth.
This is it. I've had it.

1397
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:09,204
I don't wanna
see you again.

1398
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:14,737
I don't want you to come to the house.
I don't want you to call.

1399
01:29:14,815 --> 01:29:18,751
This is worse than the casino.
You've been stealing.

1400
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:22,922
Look at me.

1401
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:26,993
You're destroying
people's lives.

1402
01:29:32,499 --> 01:29:35,024
<i>I'm telling you,</i>
<i>he's about to make a move.</i>

1403
01:29:35,102 --> 01:29:38,868
No! I can't afford
to leave him out there any longer.

1404
01:29:38,939 --> 01:29:41,601
This girlfriend of his may have
already tipped him off.

1405
01:29:41,675 --> 01:29:44,542
- He could run at any time.
- She hasn't, sir.

1406
01:29:44,611 --> 01:29:46,545
How could you
possibly know that?

1407
01:29:46,613 --> 01:29:50,606
And if you're right
and she's so loyal to you...

1408
01:29:50,684 --> 01:29:53,812
then why hasn't she given us
any information yet?

1409
01:29:53,887 --> 01:29:57,379
I want Davis brought in
by the end of the week. Period.

1410
01:29:57,458 --> 01:30:01,554
There'll be a lot of heat coming down
'cause of what Farrow Tech did.

1411
01:30:01,628 --> 01:30:03,562
So be smart on the phone.
Calm people down.

1412
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:06,690
The stocks dropped 86%
from yesterday's close.

1413
01:30:06,767 --> 01:30:09,235
I don't want people dumping
their shares, understand?

1414
01:30:09,303 --> 01:30:12,397
Isaac, I got a Mr. Klastow.
He's super hot.

1415
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:14,464
Fuck! I gotta deal
with this guy now?

1416
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:19,071
You wanna transfer
your account out? Go ahead.

1417
01:30:19,146 --> 01:30:21,307
You're gonna transfer to some broker
who doesn't owe you shit.

1418
01:30:21,382 --> 01:30:24,681
I'm sorry we couldn't foresee this when
we first came to you with the stock.

1419
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:25,650
I lost you $60,000.

1420
01:30:25,719 --> 01:30:29,018
There is no one who wants to make
that money back for you more than I.

1421
01:30:29,089 --> 01:30:31,887
When's the last time
you closed something?

1422
01:30:31,959 --> 01:30:34,223
You couldn't close
a fuckin' window, you moron!

1423
01:30:37,831 --> 01:30:41,028
What the fuck is this?
What is this?

1424
01:30:41,101 --> 01:30:43,001
You think I'm gonna sign
a sell ticket for you?

1425
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:45,436
What'd I just say?

1426
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:47,838
Get him back on the phone
and explain the situation to him.

1427
01:30:47,908 --> 01:30:52,572
Get on the phone! No one is gonna
unload today, you hear me? No one.

1428
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:56,910
You're a mutt.

1429
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:59,578
Seth, I've got a Harry Reynard
on the phone.

1430
01:30:59,653 --> 01:31:02,679
Yeah, put him through.

1431
01:31:04,758 --> 01:31:07,727
- <i>Hi, Harry. I was gonna call you.</i>
- I want my money back.

1432
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:09,729
- Look, Harry,
- I know you're pissed.

1433
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:13,563
We had a setback, but don't worry.
It's become a gold stock.

1434
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:17,297
<i>I plan to bring you eight or nine points</i>
<i>over the course of this year.</i>

1435
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:20,101
People are talking about it
like it's the next Microsoft.

1436
01:31:20,174 --> 01:31:24,235
Listen, I'm in a heap of trouble here.
I need that money back.

1437
01:31:24,311 --> 01:31:27,246
It was supposed to be a down payment
for a house for my family...

1438
01:31:27,314 --> 01:31:29,248
and now we're gonna
lose the house.

1439
01:31:29,316 --> 01:31:32,752
- <i>It's gonna rebound.</i>
- Seth, I need the money back!

1440
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:35,220
I'm sorry, Harry.
I can't do that.

1441
01:31:35,289 --> 01:31:37,985
Please, Seth,
I need the money back!

1442
01:31:38,058 --> 01:31:40,720
I have to go.

1443
01:31:40,794 --> 01:31:43,592
Hello? Hello?

1444
01:31:45,999 --> 01:31:48,559
If he calls back,
I'm not here.

1445
01:31:57,878 --> 01:31:59,743
J.T. Marlin.

1446
01:31:59,813 --> 01:32:01,678
- Seth Davis.
- <i>May I ask who's calling?</i>

1447
01:32:01,748 --> 01:32:05,206
- It's Harry Reynard.
- <i>He just stepped out for a meeting.</i>

1448
01:32:05,285 --> 01:32:08,777
Oh, God! Damn it!

1449
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:23,231
<i>I wish my dad could've stepped</i>
<i>into the casino just once.</i>

1450
01:32:23,303 --> 01:32:25,237
<i>He would've had</i>
<i>to be impressed.</i>

1451
01:32:25,305 --> 01:32:30,333
<i>Four employees, an organized payroll,</i>
<i>huge client list.</i>

1452
01:32:30,410 --> 01:32:33,607
<i>It's funny looking back.</i>
<i>The illegal business I was running...</i>

1453
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:36,240
<i>was the most legitimate thing</i>
<i>I had going.</i>

1454
01:32:36,316 --> 01:32:41,686
<i>I looked my customers in the eye</i>
<i>and provided a service they wanted.</i>

1455
01:32:41,755 --> 01:32:44,690
<i>Now, I don't even</i>
<i>look at my customers...</i>

1456
01:32:44,758 --> 01:32:48,956
<i>and I push them something</i>
<i>they never asked for.</i>

1457
01:32:55,536 --> 01:32:57,697
What are you
doing here, Seth?

1458
01:32:57,771 --> 01:33:00,763
I thought I told you
I didn't want to see you again.

1459
01:33:00,841 --> 01:33:02,968
I need to talk to you.

1460
01:33:03,043 --> 01:33:05,409
What is it?

1461
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:07,504
I want out of the firm.

1462
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:09,811
Great. Leave. I don't care
what you do anymore.

1463
01:33:09,883 --> 01:33:12,852
I'll tell you this, your coming here
is unacceptable to me.

1464
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,388
- Do you want to cost me my judgeship?
- No.

1465
01:33:15,455 --> 01:33:17,047
I can't have any connection to you.

1466
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:20,890
I wanna get out of the firm
like you told me to.

1467
01:33:20,961 --> 01:33:23,088
- I just need your help.
- What do you need my help for?

1468
01:33:23,163 --> 01:33:25,996
You're getting out.
Fine. Whatever.

1469
01:33:26,066 --> 01:33:29,331
I don't care if you stay there or not.
Just get out of here!

1470
01:33:30,904 --> 01:33:32,496
I wanted to...

1471
01:33:32,573 --> 01:33:36,100
There was this investment
that I wanted to tell you about.

1472
01:33:36,176 --> 01:33:39,111
Oh, Seth. Please.
You've gotta be kidding me.

1473
01:33:39,179 --> 01:33:42,444
No... I mean,
you can make a lot of money.

1474
01:33:42,516 --> 01:33:46,680
- Seth, you listen to me...
- We could make a couple big trades...

1475
01:33:46,753 --> 01:33:50,587
that J.T. Marlin
wants you to invest in...

1476
01:33:50,657 --> 01:33:54,058
and then when
the next I.P.O. Comes out...

1477
01:33:54,127 --> 01:33:57,688
No, stop. Are you asking me
to go in on a stock scam with you?

1478
01:33:57,764 --> 01:34:02,064
What, are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you nuts? Listen.

1479
01:34:02,135 --> 01:34:04,933
I think it's time
for you to...

1480
01:34:14,781 --> 01:34:17,011
Do you remember this day?

1481
01:34:17,084 --> 01:34:19,052
Yes, of course.
I bought you that bike.

1482
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:23,146
Do you remember what happened
about a month after that?

1483
01:34:23,223 --> 01:34:25,623
All right. What is it?
What do you want from me?

1484
01:34:25,692 --> 01:34:29,458
Do you remember when I broke...
when I broke my leg?

1485
01:34:29,529 --> 01:34:31,963
Yes, Seth, I remember
you broke your leg.

1486
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:37,459
What is it? You were hysterical!
I had to get you to stop!

1487
01:34:39,539 --> 01:34:42,269
My fucking leg...

1488
01:34:42,342 --> 01:34:44,640
was broken.

1489
01:34:44,711 --> 01:34:47,475
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry I couldn't...

1490
01:34:47,547 --> 01:34:49,913
get the job
that you wanted me to have.

1491
01:34:49,983 --> 01:34:54,215
But... I mean...
Who gives a shit?

1492
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:57,018
'Cause I'm good
at what I do, Dad.

1493
01:34:57,090 --> 01:35:00,025
I'm good at what I do!

1494
01:35:00,093 --> 01:35:04,655
And the casino...
The casino was a fucking business...

1495
01:35:04,731 --> 01:35:07,962
and I ran it
pretty fuckin' well, Dad!

1496
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:11,163
- And to think that I closed it for you!
- Wait, wait.

1497
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:13,297
Wait.
When did you close it?

1498
01:35:13,373 --> 01:35:17,969
And then I got this job 'cause I thought
it was what you wanted me to be doing!

1499
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:20,377
Seth, wait a second.
When did you close it?

1500
01:35:20,447 --> 01:35:25,146
And I tried... I tried to make
the changes that you wanted me to!

1501
01:35:25,218 --> 01:35:27,652
And I'm leaving J.T. Now!

1502
01:35:27,721 --> 01:35:32,283
I'm just asking you for this one thing.
Just this one thing, please!

1503
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:35,192
Help your son!

1504
01:35:39,066 --> 01:35:42,194
I can't, Seth.
I can't. I'm sorry.

1505
01:35:59,152 --> 01:36:01,677
What are you
gonna do now?

1506
01:36:01,755 --> 01:36:05,020
I'm still gonna do it.
I have a friend that'll go in with me.

1507
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:07,754
If I do it right,
I can take J.T. For at least 300 grand.

1508
01:36:07,828 --> 01:36:10,228
- My father can go to hell.
- Seth, my mom.

1509
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:14,495
- I'm sorry.
- I don't think you should do it.

1510
01:36:14,568 --> 01:36:17,162
- I think you should just quit.
- I told you...

1511
01:36:17,237 --> 01:36:19,262
I've invested
too much time in this.

1512
01:36:19,339 --> 01:36:21,273
I have no more money
coming in anymore...

1513
01:36:21,341 --> 01:36:23,901
because Jeff tanked
my fucking gold mine.

1514
01:36:23,977 --> 01:36:25,911
I need this.

1515
01:36:25,979 --> 01:36:29,176
I could hook you up with my friend
that works over at Smith Barney.

1516
01:36:29,249 --> 01:36:31,774
- I know you can get a job there.
- Doing what? Ticket running?

1517
01:36:31,852 --> 01:36:36,949
You think coming from J.T. Marlin,
they'll let me trade? No fuckin' way.

1518
01:36:37,023 --> 01:36:41,619
Why are you so against this?
What do you care if I pull this off?

1519
01:36:41,695 --> 01:36:44,220
This is gonna be great
for both of us.

1520
01:36:56,042 --> 01:36:59,375
Seth, I just have
a bad feeling about all this.

1521
01:37:00,847 --> 01:37:03,372
- I gotta go.
- Seth, I need to talk to you.

1522
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:05,441
I've just got to
figure something out.

1523
01:37:05,519 --> 01:37:07,453
I need to tell you something.
Please don't walk out.

1524
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:09,955
Abby, can you come in here
for a second?

1525
01:37:10,023 --> 01:37:14,960
Yeah, Mom, one sec...
Seth. Fuck.

1526
01:37:15,028 --> 01:37:17,428
Mommy, what's going on?

1527
01:37:18,665 --> 01:37:21,099
Okay. Get that. Let's go.

1528
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:23,898
- Mom, where are we going?
- Let's just go.

1529
01:37:33,647 --> 01:37:36,013
Yeah, I know.

1530
01:37:36,082 --> 01:37:39,779
You went too far this time.

1531
01:37:39,853 --> 01:37:44,916
Well, then, when you'd figured it out,
you should've said something.

1532
01:37:44,991 --> 01:37:48,051
No, he certainly
hasn't helped any.

1533
01:37:51,932 --> 01:37:55,265
But he loves you, Seth.

1534
01:37:55,335 --> 01:37:57,428
Do you know that?

1535
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:00,439
It's important
that you know that.

1536
01:38:09,449 --> 01:38:10,609
Line three.

1537
01:38:15,689 --> 01:38:18,783
- Seth Davis here.
- Hi, Seth. How are you?

1538
01:38:20,694 --> 01:38:23,925
- <i>Dad?</i>
- Yep.

1539
01:38:23,997 --> 01:38:27,558
Listen, can I change your mind
about doing this I.P.O. Scheme?

1540
01:38:27,634 --> 01:38:30,535
No, I'm sorry.

1541
01:38:30,604 --> 01:38:33,072
I've already gone in
with somebody.

1542
01:38:33,139 --> 01:38:35,869
Well, then, I'm gonna
help you out with this.

1543
01:38:35,942 --> 01:38:38,911
You're gonna do it with me?

1544
01:38:38,979 --> 01:38:40,913
No, Seth.
You know I can't do that...

1545
01:38:40,981 --> 01:38:43,381
but at least I can make sure
you don't get caught.

1546
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:46,078
<i>I know somebody</i>
<i>over at Ellis Proud...</i>

1547
01:38:46,152 --> 01:38:48,677
and they can talk to you
about it.

1548
01:38:48,755 --> 01:38:52,885
<i>So, why don't you come over</i>
<i>to the house tomorrow night?</i>

1549
01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:55,052
Thank you, Dad.
I'm so glad you called.

1550
01:38:55,128 --> 01:38:57,255
Me too.

1551
01:38:57,330 --> 01:39:00,128
Okay, kiddo.
Tomorrow night.

1552
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,065
Okay.

1553
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:12,937
So, do you wanna
talk to me, or... I mean...

1554
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:16,671
I don't know
what to tell you.

1555
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:20,277
Let's think about this whole thing.
If you pull this I.P.O. Deal off...

1556
01:39:20,353 --> 01:39:23,379
and I'm associated with you,
what do you think will happen to me?

1557
01:39:23,456 --> 01:39:26,687
- But they can't prove anything.
- Who says they have to?

1558
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:31,094
I'm gonna lose my job unless I put
some distance between us right now.

1559
01:39:31,164 --> 01:39:35,100
Who cares about that?
I'm gonna take care of you.

1560
01:39:35,168 --> 01:39:39,764
Look, you are the one real thing
in my life right now.

1561
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:45,137
Get out of the car, please.

1562
01:39:45,211 --> 01:39:50,274
You are under arrest for violation
of 26 S.E.C. And N.A.S.D. Regulations.

1563
01:39:50,350 --> 01:39:52,875
What the hell is going on
out here?

1564
01:39:52,953 --> 01:39:55,421
Seth, I'm gonna get you
out of this.

1565
01:39:55,488 --> 01:39:59,948
- Just don't call my father.
- Get back in the car, Abby.

1566
01:40:12,606 --> 01:40:15,370
Why is he here right now?
He didn't do anything.

1567
01:40:15,442 --> 01:40:17,535
Seth, what the hell
is going on?

1568
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:20,876
- You've been talking to them about me.
- Of course not!

1569
01:40:20,947 --> 01:40:24,348
- What is he doing here right now?
- Seth, are you sure?

1570
01:40:24,417 --> 01:40:28,786
Of course I'm sure.
I didn't say anything.

1571
01:40:28,855 --> 01:40:31,483
All right. That's it.
I am out of here in three seconds...

1572
01:40:31,558 --> 01:40:34,220
unless you can
charge me with something.

1573
01:40:35,996 --> 01:40:39,932
<i>Can I change your mind</i>
<i>about doing the I.P.O. Scheme?</i>

1574
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,868
<i>Well, then I'm gonna help you out.</i>
<i>I know somebody over at Ellis Proud.</i>

1575
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:46,132
<i>At least I can make sure</i>
<i>you don't get caught.</i>

1576
01:40:48,775 --> 01:40:50,709
Oh, my God.

1577
01:40:50,777 --> 01:40:54,178
<i>So, what</i>
<i>do you want from me?</i>

1578
01:40:54,247 --> 01:40:56,340
I want you to testify.

1579
01:40:56,416 --> 01:41:00,614
- Well, what are you offering?
- Full immunity.

1580
01:41:00,687 --> 01:41:06,250
- And what happens with my father?
- He won't do any time.

1581
01:41:06,326 --> 01:41:09,056
Seth, I haven't done
anything illegal.

1582
01:41:09,129 --> 01:41:11,359
So, what's the deal, then?

1583
01:41:11,431 --> 01:41:14,958
The deal is I lose my judgeship
just going along for the ride.

1584
01:41:15,035 --> 01:41:19,165
- I have nothing to do with that.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1585
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:21,332
Are you gonna release the tape
to the press?

1586
01:41:21,408 --> 01:41:24,639
Makes your case more glamorous
with the involvement of a federal judge.

1587
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:28,306
- No. No, no. No deal.
- Why?

1588
01:41:28,381 --> 01:41:33,216
No, you take my father out the back,
and you bring him home.

1589
01:41:33,286 --> 01:41:35,880
He has nothing
to do with this case.

1590
01:41:35,955 --> 01:41:40,187
I swear to God, if he ends up
in one newspaper, I do not testify.

1591
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:43,058
And I mean that.

1592
01:41:43,129 --> 01:41:45,825
For me, it'd be worth
going to jail for.

1593
01:41:45,899 --> 01:41:49,357
- You serious?
- What do you think?

1594
01:41:53,239 --> 01:41:58,267
Before we get ahead of ourselves,
just what are you offering?

1595
01:41:58,344 --> 01:42:02,178
I'm gonna hand you this case
on a silver fucking platter.

1596
01:42:02,248 --> 01:42:05,911
I know everything you don't.
I know how it all works.

1597
01:42:05,985 --> 01:42:08,351
<i>I know how Michael</i>
<i>makes his money.</i>

1598
01:42:08,421 --> 01:42:10,446
<i>I know how he hides it.</i>

1599
01:42:10,523 --> 01:42:13,117
<i>I know who he goes in with.</i>

1600
01:42:13,193 --> 01:42:16,788
<i>I even know where he moves</i>
<i>if you guys get too close.</i>

1601
01:42:16,863 --> 01:42:19,696
I know everything!

1602
01:42:19,766 --> 01:42:22,462
So tell me what happens now.

1603
01:42:22,535 --> 01:42:25,902
You go back to work tomorrow
like nothing happened, for one day.

1604
01:42:25,972 --> 01:42:30,466
I need your client book and your whole
"C" drive backed up onto floppy.

1605
01:42:36,349 --> 01:42:39,978
- And we have to hold you overnight.
- Just a minute, please.

1606
01:42:40,053 --> 01:42:44,456
Please, I want a couple of moments
alone with my son.

1607
01:42:44,524 --> 01:42:47,721
- I'm sorry...
- David, let's give them a moment.

1608
01:43:01,941 --> 01:43:05,809
I am so sorry.
I am so fuckin' sorry.

1609
01:43:07,881 --> 01:43:12,580
Seth, just let me speak.

1610
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:17,956
When I came up to you
behind that car...

1611
01:43:18,024 --> 01:43:20,515
it was the hardest thing
I ever had to bear...

1612
01:43:20,593 --> 01:43:24,791
because all I wanted to do
was make your pain disappear.

1613
01:43:30,503 --> 01:43:34,132
I don't even know how
to describe the feeling.

1614
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:43,471
I just want you
to know one thing.

1615
01:43:45,251 --> 01:43:50,314
Not a day of my life has gone by
that I don't think about that moment...

1616
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:54,554
that I don't dream about being back
there just to have one more chance.

1617
01:43:58,898 --> 01:44:01,890
I am more sorry
than you will ever know.

1618
01:44:17,917 --> 01:44:23,082
You know that E! 's got
that bathing suit thing going.

1619
01:44:23,156 --> 01:44:25,351
French Riviera.
It's on tonight.

1620
01:44:25,425 --> 01:44:29,225
The guy was an idiot. He acted like
he was from Staten Island. No...

1621
01:44:29,295 --> 01:44:33,231
<i>Hi, you've reached the Reynards.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1622
01:44:33,299 --> 01:44:35,460
<i>Thanks. Have a nice day.</i>

1623
01:44:35,535 --> 01:44:37,696
Hey, Harry.
It's Seth Davis.

1624
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:40,034
- Are you there?
- Isaac, your mother on line three.

1625
01:44:40,106 --> 01:44:44,008
You know, about the way
things went, I just...

1626
01:44:47,013 --> 01:44:49,379
I found a way
to get your money back.

1627
01:44:49,449 --> 01:44:51,542
I just need you
to call me back, all right?

1628
01:44:51,618 --> 01:44:54,451
George, get me a coffee.
Thanks.

1629
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,454
So call me.

1630
01:45:13,206 --> 01:45:15,106
What?

1631
01:45:15,174 --> 01:45:18,940
- Hi.
- What's up?

1632
01:45:19,012 --> 01:45:22,470
- I want to talk to you about a client.
- Yeah.

1633
01:45:22,548 --> 01:45:26,040
- His name is Harry Reynard.
- I don't know him.

1634
01:45:27,553 --> 01:45:29,612
I think you should,
because we're about to lose him.

1635
01:45:29,689 --> 01:45:33,489
He dropped $50,000 on
Farrow Tech this week alone.

1636
01:45:33,559 --> 01:45:34,787
And you want to do what?

1637
01:45:34,861 --> 01:45:38,058
I want to keep him here.

1638
01:45:38,131 --> 01:45:42,500
I think that we should give him
a chunk of the Med Patent I.P.O.

1639
01:45:42,568 --> 01:45:44,900
We don't hand out I.P.O. To somebody
who had a bad day on the market.

1640
01:45:44,971 --> 01:45:47,963
Look, Michael, this guy
is a fucking whale...

1641
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:50,475
and he's gonna do an obscene amount
of business with this firm.

1642
01:45:50,543 --> 01:45:54,172
- You're somehow sure of this.
- Yeah, the guy completely trusts me.

1643
01:45:54,247 --> 01:45:56,408
He doesn't even need the money.

1644
01:45:56,482 --> 01:45:58,848
He owns the biggest
foods company in Wisconsin.

1645
01:45:58,918 --> 01:46:00,783
He just wants to know
we're gonna do right by him.

1646
01:46:00,853 --> 01:46:02,411
How many trades has he made?

1647
01:46:04,123 --> 01:46:05,681
Two.

1648
01:46:05,758 --> 01:46:08,693
But he made a second trade
a week after I opened him.

1649
01:46:08,761 --> 01:46:12,128
Look, the guy's pretty fuckin'
sour on Farrow Tech...

1650
01:46:12,198 --> 01:46:13,426
and he's gonna walk.

1651
01:46:13,499 --> 01:46:17,367
I just think we need to make him
a little money on this next I.P. <i>O...</i>

1652
01:46:17,437 --> 01:46:19,371
and let him
take it for a ride.

1653
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:21,669
What did Greg say?

1654
01:46:21,741 --> 01:46:25,199
He's busy closing somebody.
I didn't want to bother him.

1655
01:46:26,946 --> 01:46:28,811
Well, go get him.

1656
01:46:32,185 --> 01:46:35,552
Hey, Greg.
Michael wants to see you.

1657
01:46:48,401 --> 01:46:51,564
I don't know what he told you,
but I've had it with this shit.

1658
01:46:51,637 --> 01:46:56,574
This is a business, all right?
He should be making calls...

1659
01:46:56,642 --> 01:47:00,874
not in here bitching about
personal petty shit between me and him.

1660
01:47:00,947 --> 01:47:04,075
Seth was talking about giving
Med Patent I.P.O. To Harry Reynard.

1661
01:47:05,818 --> 01:47:07,752
What... Are you
fucking kidding me?

1662
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:10,380
First of all, I don't even
know this guy Reynard.

1663
01:47:10,456 --> 01:47:14,483
No way. He's totally unreliable.
What are you doing?

1664
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,654
Guy dropped 50 large
on Farrow Tech this week.

1665
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:22,599
That's great. But I have lots of clients
who deserve I.P.O. More than this guy.

1666
01:47:22,668 --> 01:47:24,431
Clients who've been
with me six months...

1667
01:47:24,504 --> 01:47:26,233
taken losses
and continue to trade.

1668
01:47:26,305 --> 01:47:29,536
- And he's one of 'em, asshole.
- You see what I'm dealing with here?

1669
01:47:29,609 --> 01:47:33,409
- What do you mean, "he's one of them"?
- He's one of Greg's clients.

1670
01:47:33,479 --> 01:47:34,741
What?

1671
01:47:34,814 --> 01:47:36,714
I opened him when I was
closing my 40 accounts for you.

1672
01:47:36,783 --> 01:47:38,876
I'm just his contact here.
He's your client.

1673
01:47:38,951 --> 01:47:40,942
I'm not gonna
make a dime off this trade.

1674
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:42,851
No wonder the guy's pissed off.

1675
01:47:42,922 --> 01:47:45,220
His own broker doesn't even know
he's a fuckin' client here.

1676
01:47:48,294 --> 01:47:50,592
Fine.

1677
01:47:50,663 --> 01:47:52,858
Give him 10,000 shares.

1678
01:47:52,932 --> 01:47:55,628
He just can't sell it
before we say so.

1679
01:47:55,701 --> 01:47:58,864
- Great. Okay.
- No joke, Seth.

1680
01:47:58,938 --> 01:48:01,805
He cannot sell it
before we sell it.

1681
01:48:01,874 --> 01:48:05,401
- At least six months, you understand?
- Absolutely. Absolutely.

1682
01:48:05,478 --> 01:48:08,311
Greg, I'm sure you don't
have a problem with this.

1683
01:48:08,381 --> 01:48:10,781
Can you get the fuck
out of my office?

1684
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:12,784
Fine.

1685
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:19,249
What the fuck are you doing?

1686
01:48:19,325 --> 01:48:22,317
Stand up! You cannot sit down
for the rest of the fuckin' day!

1687
01:48:22,395 --> 01:48:26,491
You cannot sit down
ever again! Okay?

1688
01:48:29,402 --> 01:48:31,336
Seth, line two.

1689
01:48:38,511 --> 01:48:41,878
- Hello?
- <i>It's time, Seth.</i>

1690
01:48:41,948 --> 01:48:43,916
<i>Get going.</i>

1691
01:49:15,681 --> 01:49:17,615
I'm going to lunch, boys.

1692
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:36,568
What's this about?
You okay?

1693
01:49:36,636 --> 01:49:42,404
I need you to sign a sell ticket
for a client of mine.

1694
01:49:42,475 --> 01:49:44,636
Fuck Greg!
Let's fuckin' deal with...

1695
01:49:44,710 --> 01:49:47,975
- Let's talk to Michael.
- No, wait. Wait, wait.

1696
01:49:48,047 --> 01:49:50,038
Chris, I got arrested
last night.

1697
01:49:50,116 --> 01:49:52,414
What?

1698
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:55,215
The F.B.I. Arrested me.

1699
01:49:55,288 --> 01:49:58,257
The F.B. I? Why the fuck
would the F.B.I. Arrest you?

1700
01:49:58,324 --> 01:50:00,815
Because of my involvement
in this firm.

1701
01:50:00,893 --> 01:50:04,852
Your involvement in the firm?
What the fuck does that mean?

1702
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:06,990
Come on, Chris.
You know what that means.

1703
01:50:07,066 --> 01:50:09,261
No, I don't know what that means.
What does that mean?

1704
01:50:09,335 --> 01:50:12,964
- What the fuck did you tell 'em?
- No. No.

1705
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:17,772
No, they knew everything, man.
They had photographs.

1706
01:50:17,843 --> 01:50:21,404
They had... They had
tape-recorded conversations.

1707
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:23,744
They brought my father in,
you know. I mean...

1708
01:50:23,816 --> 01:50:27,582
- Chris, there was nothing I could do.
- What did you do?

1709
01:50:27,653 --> 01:50:30,087
Chris, the F.B.I. Are gonna
raid the place in 20 minutes.

1710
01:50:30,156 --> 01:50:33,057
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1711
01:50:33,125 --> 01:50:35,355
Fuck, Seth!

1712
01:50:35,428 --> 01:50:37,362
Come on, man.

1713
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:39,557
I asked you for months
about shit going down here...

1714
01:50:39,632 --> 01:50:41,566
and you told me
to shut the fuck up.

1715
01:50:41,634 --> 01:50:43,727
You said get ready
to be a millionaire!

1716
01:50:43,803 --> 01:50:46,567
That's right. Shut the fuck up.
That's all you had to do.

1717
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,163
Didn't you learn anything?

1718
01:50:48,241 --> 01:50:50,300
I learned how to fuck people
out of their money.

1719
01:50:51,577 --> 01:50:55,104
Harry Reynard just lost
his life savings.

1720
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:58,446
And he wasn't a whale.

1721
01:50:58,517 --> 01:51:03,921
He was just some poor schmuck,
and I took him.

1722
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:07,790
I did everything that J.T. Marlin
taught me to do...

1723
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:09,828
and I made up his mind
for him.

1724
01:51:09,895 --> 01:51:13,797
What do you want me to tell you?
That's what we do here.

1725
01:51:13,866 --> 01:51:16,892
What? We lie?
We're liars?

1726
01:51:17,970 --> 01:51:21,770
Seth, this...

1727
01:51:26,846 --> 01:51:28,780
Who are they coming for?

1728
01:51:28,848 --> 01:51:32,215
They're coming
for everybody, everything.

1729
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:37,114
You know how hard I worked
to get where I am?

1730
01:51:37,189 --> 01:51:39,749
No, Chris, you need
to forget about that.

1731
01:51:39,825 --> 01:51:41,884
It doesn't mean shit.

1732
01:51:41,961 --> 01:51:44,759
Right now at this moment
is what you should be thinking about.

1733
01:51:44,830 --> 01:51:47,594
What are you gonna do
in the next 15 minutes?

1734
01:51:47,667 --> 01:51:51,467
They're gonna come in here,
and make sure that we never trade...

1735
01:51:51,537 --> 01:51:53,937
another share of stock
for the rest of our lives.

1736
01:51:54,006 --> 01:51:58,170
- But we can do something.
- What's that?

1737
01:51:58,244 --> 01:52:01,008
Harry, my client.

1738
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:04,413
I need a senior broker
to sign a sell ticket...

1739
01:52:04,483 --> 01:52:06,348
so he can take his shares...

1740
01:52:06,419 --> 01:52:11,118
and dump 'em on the open market
and make his money back.

1741
01:52:15,261 --> 01:52:18,697
Come on, Chris. Come on.
What's the difference?

1742
01:52:18,764 --> 01:52:21,528
Do one thing right here.

1743
01:52:22,601 --> 01:52:25,229
Just sign it, please.

1744
01:52:32,978 --> 01:52:35,003
Thank you, Chris.

1745
01:52:41,554 --> 01:52:44,990
I'm so sorry.

1746
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:09,946
<i>I'm plagued by "what ifs"</i>
<i>these days.</i>

1747
01:53:10,015 --> 01:53:13,382
<i>What if Greg hadn't</i>
<i>come over that night?</i>

1748
01:53:13,452 --> 01:53:16,216
<i>What if I hadn't</i>
<i>forgotten my bag...</i>

1749
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:18,950
<i>or seen Michael walk</i>
<i>into the building that day?</i>

1750
01:53:20,693 --> 01:53:24,026
<i>What if I had</i>
<i>skipped over Harry's card?</i>

1751
01:53:24,096 --> 01:53:26,064
<i>What are the chances?</i>
<i>What are the odds?</i>

1752
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:27,861
<i>That's what I think about.</i>

1753
01:53:27,933 --> 01:53:30,561
<i>Hey, I ran a casino.</i>

1754
01:53:32,872 --> 01:53:38,208
<i>It's the next step I gotta figure out,</i>
<i>'cause I'm no lottery winner.</i>

1755
01:53:38,277 --> 01:53:43,010
<i>I tried slinging crack rock,</i>
<i>and I never had a jump shot.</i>

1756
01:53:44,116 --> 01:53:47,051
<i>I gotta find a job.</i>
