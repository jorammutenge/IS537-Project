00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,690
Andrew jorgenson,
our chairman.

187
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,424
Call me jorgy.
Everybody else does.

188
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,893
Sorry about the elevator.
It has a mind of its own.

189
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,295
Mr. Coles, our president
and general manager.

190
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,698
Emma,
bring in the coffee!

191
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,267
Last limousine
we saw here was in '48

192
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,102
When harry truman was
running for president.

193
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,004
That's right.
He stood right out there

194
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,306
On those stairs
exactly where you were.

195
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,708
Is that so?

196
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,576
Yep.
That was the golden age.

197
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,578
Rebuilding america
and all that.

198
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,446
Old harry made
a great speech that day.

199
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,448
Is that so?

200
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,818
Oh, yes. He was
very impressive.

201
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,453
He's the only democrat
bea and i ever voted for.

202
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,857
Do you know much about
the wire and cable business?

203
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,293
I know if the cable's
out of whack,

204
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,695
The elevator don't go up.

205
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,697
I'm thinking about
the doughnuts.

206
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:30,898
Doughnuts?

207
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:33,100
Mr. Garfield was
wondering if we had any.

208
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,202
Uh, bill,
do we have doughnuts?

209
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,637
I don't think so.

210
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,707
How's that coffee
coming along?

211
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:43,310
Here we are,
mr. Garfield.

212
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,311
Thank you.

213
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,713
Sugar and cream?

214
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:46,847
Sugar.
I'll take care of it.

215
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,015
Thank you, emma.

216
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,249
I could have emma
get some doughnuts.

217
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:53,386
No, no. Why don't we
get down to business?

218
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,855
What's the matter?

219
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,056
You're not interested
in doughnuts?

220
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,591
Would you like me
to get some doughnuts?

221
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,894
Jorgenson:
no. Never mind, emma.

222
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,833
You're right.

223
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,234
Let's talk business.

224
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:10,670
Good idea. What business
are we talking about?

225
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:12,873
Good coffee.

226
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,642
Well, let's put it
this way.

227
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,245
Back in new york,
i got a computer.

228
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:19,446
Her name is carmen.

229
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:22,049
Every morning, right
after i brush my teeth,

230
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,118
I punch out, "carmen,
computer on the wall,

231
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,054
Who's the fairest
of them all?"

232
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:30,123
Now, most mornings
she spits out,

233
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,625
"Garfield,
you're the fairest."

234
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:37,064
But three weeks ago,
she said,

235
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:41,735
"Garfield, garfield,
scratch your balls.

236
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,303
"New england"--Pardon me--

237
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:46,974
"New england wire and cable
is the fairest of them all."

238
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,677
New england
wire and cable?

239
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,712
I said, "what's it worth?"

240
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,282
So she showed me
the numbers.

241
00:11:57,084 --> 00:12:00,687
You got equipment here
that cost $120 million.

242
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,555
Even at salvage,

243
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,892
It's worth 30,
35 million.

244
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,260
Can i use that blackboard
over there?

245
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,061
Yeah, go ahead.

246
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,697
Thank you.
Come with me.

247
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,299
Carmen will educate us.

248
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,136
Going to erase
this stuff here.

249
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,072
Here.

250
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,242
Let's--Let's put down
30 million.

251
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,514
How many
acres you got?

252
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:28,681
110.
110.

253
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,218
Carmen and i figure
even as farmland,

254
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,686
Grazing land,
it's worth 10 million.

255
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,687
Is that fair?

256
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,956
Yeah.

257
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,958
Let's lay the 10
under the 30.

258
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,160
That makes 40 million.
All right.

259
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,561
And you bought
some other companies,

260
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:42,662
Didn't you, bill?

261
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,331
You have a plumbing,
an electrical,

262
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,867
And some kind
of adhesive company.

263
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,269
Boring, but all
making a decent profit.

264
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,704
Carmen says they're
worth another 60 mil.

265
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,941
Let's put the 60
under the 40.

266
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,476
And you have working
capital of 25 million,

267
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,278
10 0f it in cash.

268
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,881
Let's put down
25 million, add them up,

269
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,515
And see what you got.

270
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,886
$125 million.

271
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:09,322
The only bad news is

272
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,258
That this wire
and cable division

273
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,860
Isn't making
a profit.

274
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,594
And all
the other divisions

275
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:15,595
Have to support you.

276
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:16,997
Now,
as a stockholder,

277
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,032
That doesn't
make me very happy.

278
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,868
Are you finished,
mr. Garfield?

279
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,269
No, i'm not, bill.

280
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,871
Let's say carmen
was suffering

281
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,272
From premenstrual
syndrome.

282
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,007
No offense.
A little nuts.

283
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,342
Let's say she was
too optimistic.

284
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,644
Let's knock off
25 million.

285
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,080
Here we go.
Let's make it...

286
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,916
$100 million.

287
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,284
A nice round number.

288
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,552
I like nice
round numbers.

289
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,022
Any debt? No.

290
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,023
Any lawsuits?

291
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,424
Any environmental
bullshit?

292
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,026
You throwing garbage
in the water?

293
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,861
Of course not.
Not you.

294
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,262
What about pension
liabilities?

295
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,865
Carmen says
you're fully funded.

296
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,867
You people
are dreams.

297
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,036
I think
this meeting is over.

298
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,070
No, no, no, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

299
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,438
Here comes the fun part.

300
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,507
How many shares
outstanding you got?

301
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,408
4 million.

302
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,043
Divide 4 million
into 100 million,

303
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,244
What do you get?

304
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,278
25.

305
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,048
Good. That means each
share is worth $25.

306
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,050
But that
was all foreplay.

307
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,385
Let's go
for the real thing.

308
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,688
The stock was 10

309
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,691
When i woke up
3 weeks ago.

310
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,694
That's a 10
for a $25-Item.

311
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,096
What a sale.

312
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,499
Something worth $25,
i can buy it for 10.

313
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,069
The company's not
for sale, mr. Garfield.

314
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,703
I don't want your company,
jorgy.

315
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,873
I just want what every
other stockholder wants--

316
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,042
I want to make money.

317
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,944
You are
making money.

318
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,346
You bought the stock
at 10. It's now 14.

319
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,881
The stock is 14
because i'm buying it.

320
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,085
I'm doing my part,
now you do yours.

321
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,054
Get rid of this
wire and cable division.

322
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,222
It's a financial cancer.

323
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,357
Would you excuse us,
please?

324
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:53,026
I want to talk
to mr. Garfield alone.

325
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:00,267
What the hell do you
think you're doing,

326
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,401
You little son
of a bitch?

327
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,603
You can't come
into my town,

328
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,738
My plant,
take my company.

329
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,806
You can't do that.

330
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,408
You been livin'
on mars, jorgy?

331
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,743
It's called
a corporate takeover.

332
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,979
I know
what it's called,

333
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,313
And i'm not going
to let you do it.

334
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,983
It's simple.
I do it all the time.

335
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,384
Well, do it
someplace else.

336
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,419
I'm not going
to commit suicide.

337
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,123
Don't think of it
as suicide. Yecchh.

338
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,924
Think of it
as euthanasia.

339
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,428
Get out. Get out.

340
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,631
Get out before
i throw you out.

341
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,033
Where are you going?

342
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,601
We're just
doing business.

343
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,903
Business? With you?

344
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:37,971
[Chuckling]

345
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,939
I got a company to run.

346
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,341
Yeah, well,
that's my point.

347
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:44,544
I don't like the way
my company's being run!

348
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,879
And you better get
your elevator fixed!

349
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,116
There's a goddamn
fire raging here,

350
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,917
And this whole industry's
up in flames!

351
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,153
And you call
the fire department,

352
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,188
And who shows up? Nobody.

353
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,191
Because they're all
in japan and singapore

354
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,828
And malaysia and taiwan
and every other shit hole

355
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,863
Where they're crazy
about pollution.

356
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,266
And while
that inferno is raging,

357
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:10,270
You're out in front
mowing the lawn, tidying up,

358
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,673
Playing with your putz
on my money!

359
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:18,745
You'd think i was
asking him for a loan.

360
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,247

They give us
trouble today?

They're not
going to send us

Well, it's official.

374
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,265
Our friend
garfield's intent

375
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,000
Is to take
over the company.

376
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,602

I own 20%.

381
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,984
Jorgy, we've got
to protect ourselves.

382
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,220
We need legal advice.

383
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,354
We have lawyers.

384
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,255
They're not equipped
to handle this.

385
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,256
We need the best.

00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,458

I'll tell her
we need her.

We've never seen
a man like that.

00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,064
He's like something
out of a comic book.

395
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,800
So they say.

396
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,801
Hello, kate.

Thanks for coming.

Would you mind if we
get right down to it?

402
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:06,279
You're
in charge, kate.

403
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,981
Now, given that
someone's interested

404
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,183
In moving in on you,

405
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,185
You've no choice but
to protect yourself.

406
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,586
You have some options.

407
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,888
For openers,
i recommend changing

408
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,089
Your state
of incorporation

409
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,758
From rhode island
to delaware.

410
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:19,759
Why delaware?

411
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,160
That's a good idea.

412
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,463
Strong anti-Takeover
legislation there.

413
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:26,233
That way we're not
playing dead.

414
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,435
Who the hell is
playing dead?

415
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,502
You have
to protect yourself.

416
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,239
By running away
to delaware?

417
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,640
It's only on paper.

418
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,975
This company was
founded in rhode island.

419
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,110
It will remain
in rhode island.

420
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,712
I'm talking
about delaware,

421
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,714
Not nairobi.

422
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:42,515
Come on.

423
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,484
I own 20% of this company.

424
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,852
The board owns another 5,

425
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:49,422
The employees another 5%.
That's 30%.

426
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,057
Now how can this man
get control?

427
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,325
What do you want,

428
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,594
For me to negotiate
a deal or not?

429
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:57,264
But there's no deal
to be made.

He's knocking
at your door.

431
00:19:58,498 --> 00:19:59,632
If you don't
answer it,

432
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,268
It's the same as
inviting him in.

433
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:03,403
Listen to her, jorgy.

434
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,506
There's no deal
to be made with predators.

435
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,508
You kill it
or it kills you.

436
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,477
Well,
what do you suggest?

437
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:12,279
Make it worth
his while to leave.

438
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,813
How? How?
What do you mean?

439
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,283
Pay him off.
Buy him out at a profit.

440
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:17,517
It's greenmail, jorgy,

441
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,286
But it's done
all the time.

442
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:22,289
It's terrorism,
and i won't do it!

443
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:23,390
Any other options?

444
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,457
You're going to lose
your company.

00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,693
Like hell i am.

446
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,161
You, as they say
in the street,

447
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,563
Are in play.

448
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,232
Garfield
put you there,

449
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,235
And now i'm here
as your lawyer.

450
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,238
Isn't that a hell
of an irony?

451
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,974

your company.

452
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,743

are ready for a fitting.

Can they come up

460
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,199
Tell 'em 5:00 is ok.

461

464

And tell granger if
he wants to see me

465
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,541
He'd better make
sense this time

466
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,343
Or he can get on the
unemployment line.

467
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:18,345

exact words, sir?

468

I've done maybe 7, 8
deals like this before,

No. Just not hungry.

00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,049
You have to be hungry
to eat a doughnut?

Or when it makes sense.

514
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,783
It only makes sense
when i'm in trouble.

presence of a lady."

exactly that right now

00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,283
You must behave
yourself...

541
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,685
You must
behave yourself...

542
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,253
When you're
in the presence...

543
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,255
When you're
in the presence

544
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,691
Of a lady.

545
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,531
See? Not so hard.

546
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,873
[Buzz]

547
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,477
See you
in two weeks.

548
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,948
Wow! Did you
see that, carmen?

549
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:45,151
I love it, love it,
love it.

550
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,152
Goodbye,
miss sullivan.

551
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,687
Goodbye.

552
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,497
[Buzz]

553
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,605
Call erickson, tell him
to arrange some money

554
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:06,873
Through the royal bank.

555
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:09,308
Don't pay him more than
we did on fleetwood.

556
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,010
Then call hathaway,
tell him

557
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,378
I want
to make a tender offer

558
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,913
For new england
wire and cable.

559
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:17,884
Don't put it under our name.
Label it "opm holdings."

560
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:20,486
But what if she finds out
we broke the agreement?

561
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:24,490
Richardson, were
you born yesterday?

562
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,458
What do you think
she's doing as we speak?

563
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,528
That kewpie doll's up
to no good. Do it.

564
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,931
I got us
an extra two weeks.

565
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,332
Now we have to move fast.

566
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:36,368
Get the board to buy up
as many shares as they can.

567
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,970
Use your own
working capital.

568
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,506
Andrew: no, no, that's not
what those dollars are for.

569
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:41,540
That's our safety net.

570
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,242
Then borrow the money.

571
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:44,276
No borrowing.

572
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:47,279
Andrew, listen to her.
She's making sense.

573
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,281
For every share
you acquire,

574
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,083
It's one less
for garfield.

575
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,552
The more we buy,
the less for him.

576
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,555
The more it costs,
the less profit he makes.

577
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,957
So get the stock up.

578
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:00,326
Oh, and mom,
make sure to buy it through

579
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,327
An out-Of-State broker.

580
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,262
I don't want
to borrow money.

581
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,832
We've been debt-Free
since the depression.

582
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:07,700
But see,
that's the trouble.

583
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,435
It's your gorgeous
balance sheet

584
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,237
That makes
you so attractive.

585
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,840
Oh, and mom, get letters
out to the shareholders.

586
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,442
Tell them
how great business is,

587
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:18,344
And how wonderful
the future looks.

588
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:19,746
I'll do it.

589
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:22,348
Great. I'll call you
tomorrow. Good night.

590
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,336
Mmm.

591
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:49,208
Mmm...
good morning, honey.

592
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:59,652
How you doing
this morning, huh?

593
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,356
Oh...

594
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,894
Ooh...

595
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:09,996
You got it up again.

596
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:13,099
Another point
and a half.

597
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:13,900
Pfeiffer.

598
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,501
Good morning,
mr. Garfield.

599
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:16,502
Woody.

600
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:17,503
Good morning.

601
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:18,771
Harriet.

602
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:20,506
Miss sullivan is gonna
call tomorrow morning.

603
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,909
You tell her
i'm not taking calls.

604
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:24,944
Then when she comes
over here

605
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:26,679
And tries to storm
into the office,

606
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:27,914
You try to keep her out.

607
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:29,281
But then you can
let her push past.

608
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,917
Don't worry, she's
desperate but harmless.

609
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:33,185
Find out where she lives
and call the florist.

610
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,422
Florist?
Florist.

611
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:43,696
You have a good evening,
miss sullivan.

612
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,398
Hello, michael.

613
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,867
Oh, miss sullivan. Uh...

614
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:50,770
Here. Somebody
brought these by for you.

615
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,404
Oh, thank you.

616
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,405
Good night.

617
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,406
Good night.

618
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,458
Good morning.

619
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,860
Good morning.

620
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:54,700
Oh! You ruthless
son of a bitch!

621
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,835
Excuse me?

622
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:58,437
Jeez, what's
her problem?

623
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:17,456
Uhh!

624
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,091
All right,
all right.

625
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:28,467
Sorry to get
in your way.

626
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:29,836
May i help you?

627
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:31,037
I'm afraid
mr. Garfield isn't in.

628
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:33,772
I don't care!

629
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,241
It's all right, harriet.

630
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:38,610
No, it's not all right,
you hypocrite! You lied!

631
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,046
Oh. But babypoo--

632
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:41,680
We had an agreement.

633
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,683
We had a standstill!
No more buying!

634
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,819
You know nothing
about opm holdings?

635
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:48,821
Opm?
Not much to know.

636
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:50,122
You broke the agreement!

637
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,724
You embarrassed me
with my firm

638
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,193
And with my clients!

639
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:56,528
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

640
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,530
Don't come on
so holier-Than-Thou with me.

641
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,799
What am i supposed to do,
sit her and twiddle my thumbs

642
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,334
While you drive up
the price of the stock?

643
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:04,103
I did no such thing.

644
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:05,537
You're full of shit.

645
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,274
All that buying coming
from some little firm

646
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:09,341
In rhode island?

647
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,810
You'd think you'd use
an out-Of-State firm.

648
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,412
I know nothing
about that.

649
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:14,513
Give me a break.

650
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:17,083
Who am dealing with
here, mother teresa?

651
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,550
You want
to play the game,

652
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,818
Learn to play it right.

653
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,421
Oh, is that what you
call it, a game?

654
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,655
You're damn right.

655
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,224
The best game
in the world.

656
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:27,226
I'll teach you.
It's easy.

657
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:28,861
You make
as much as you can

658
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:30,562
For as long
as you can.

659
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,797
And then what?

660
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,332
"And then what?"

661
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,834
Whoever has the most
when he dies, wins.

662
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,837
Look. It's
the american way.

663
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,841
I'm doing my job.
I'm a capitalist.

664
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,843
I'm simply
following the law

665
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,345
Of free enterprise.

666
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,880
What law is that?

667
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,515
Survival
of the fittest.

668
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,384
Well, maybe some people
don't see it that way.

669
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:55,054
Maybe they don't see it
as survival of the fittest.

670
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,056
Maybe they see it
as survival of the fattest!

671
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:59,658
Oh, katie, why are
you so hard on me?

672
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:00,960
'Cause you're not nice.

673
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,595
Since when do you have
to be nice to be right?

674
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,998
You're not right.
You're what's happening.

675
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:08,300
One day we'll smarten up
and pass some laws

676
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,868
And put you
out of business.

677
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,905
They can pass
all the laws they want.

678
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:15,908
All they can do
is change the rules.

679
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:18,310
They can never
stop the game.

680
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,879
I don't go away.
I adapt.

681
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,515
10 years from now,
they'll be studying you

682
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:24,816
At the wharton school.

683
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,418
They'll call it
"the garfield era"

684
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,455
And rinse their mouths out
when they leave the room!

685
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:30,589
I'll see you in court!

686
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,024
Oh, katie,
don't leave.

687
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:33,759
We haven't talked
about sex yet.

688
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,627
At least have
a doughnut.

689
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:36,628
Stuff it!

690
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,297
Don't be a poor loser!

691
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,166
Lying to protect
your client

692
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:43,035
Is just doing a good job!
I understand that!

693
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:45,837
You didn't even ask me
what opm stands for!

694
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,074
Other people's money!

695
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:54,913
All right,
come on, come on!

696
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,648
Get--Let's go!
Work, work, work!

697
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:57,984
Yes, sir!

698
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,312
Gotcha!

699
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:28,547
Oh, yes!

700
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,750
How do you have 'em?

701
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,185
Two years ago,

702
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:35,787
He tried to take over
westridge corporation.

703
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,589
He was put
under indictment

704
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,492
For not disclosing
his 13-D. What's this?

705
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:41,293
Your christmas list.

706
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,561
What'd they do to him?

707
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:43,862
Nothing. The government
dropped the charges.

708
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:45,197
Nope.
Investors get hurt?

709
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:47,933
If the charges were dropped,
it's a technicality.

710
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,935
He was required
to disclose.

711
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,437
Gerber's in
prison, richard.

712
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:53,072
Judge pollard
ain't going to give you

713
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:56,108
A restraining order
based on a technicality.

714
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:59,911
We are a nation
of laws, marcia.

715
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,447
Ultimately,

716
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,315
Those laws come down
to technicalities.

717
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,084
Without those
technicalities,

718
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,885
What do we have?

719
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,454
Anarchy.

720
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,556

721
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:12,124
Anarchy?

722
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:14,526
That's the basis
for your brief?

723
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:15,627
Correct.

724
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:18,030
Honeybunch, you better
write a fantastic brief.

725
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,265
I intend to.

726
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:21,200
Want to send anything
to garfield?

727
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,001
Yeah. A court order.

728
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:29,241
Oh, do the japanese
celebrate christmas?

729
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:32,178
No, but i hear
they're buying it.

730
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,214
Oh...

731
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:39,818
I had nothing to do
with any of this!

732
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:40,819
Pfeiffer comes--

733
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,020
Shh!

734

736
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,535
Thank you very much.

737
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,444
Some crew i've got.

738
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:11,383
17 lawyers on retainer,

739
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,386
And you manage
to work it out

740
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,988
So that in a free market,

741
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:20,126
A so-Called
free country,

742
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:24,062
I can't buy
some shit-Ass stock

743
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,865
Every other asshole
can buy.

744
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,567
Congratulations.

745
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:32,404
You're destroying
the capitalist system.

746
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,407
While everybody else in
the world is embracing it,

747
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:39,378
My boys and girls
are fucking it up!

748
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:40,979
You know what happens

749
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:42,981
When capitalism
gets fucked up?

750
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,383
The communists come back.

751
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:46,318
They come
out of the bushes.

752
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:50,522
Don't kid yourself.
They're waiting in there.

753
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,559
But maybe
that's not so bad.

754
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,327
Because you know
what happens

755
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,129
When the commies
take over?

756
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:59,131
The first thing they do

757
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:01,400
Is shoot all the lawyers!

758
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,669
And if they miss
any of you,

759
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:04,970
I'll do it myself!

760
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,839
Now let's see if we can get
this small-Town judge

761
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,909
To change
his fucking mind!

762
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,110
Come on!

763
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:19,017
It wasn't me! I was
in san francisco!

764
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:20,619

Mr. Garfield,

768
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:27,526
A miss sullivan
is on the line.

769
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:28,760
Yes.

770
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,061
Hello, lawrence.

Toasting
judge pollard's decision.

773
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,935
Stop gloating.
It doesn't become you.

774
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,937
Don't be a poor loser.

775
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,739
I got you
on a technicality.

776
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:43,975
Not bad for some broad
wet behind the ears.

777
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,377
I'd like to talk.

778
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:48,347
I've no time for talk.
My days are full.

779
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:50,216
I'll buy you a doughnut.

780
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:51,617
I'm not hungry.

781
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:53,385
Since when do you
have to be hungry

782
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,586
To have a doughnut?

783
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,488
Aw, shut up.

784
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,090
Stop pouting.
I'll buy you dinner.

785
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,492

00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:41,520
All that putz wanted
to do

819
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,222
Was take her pants off
in the back seat,

820
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:47,926
While i was ready
to feed her,

821
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:52,130
Protect her, put jewels
around her neck.

822
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,865
I sent her poetry.

was a touchdown.

What's wrong
with a little dip?

so hard to feed.

an exquisite neck.

It's not illegal.

859
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,143
It's immoral.

00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,045
A distinction

861
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:22,648
That has no relevance
for lawyers,

862
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:24,783
But it matters to me.

863
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:27,418
Well, for someone
who has nothing nice

864
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,620
To say about lawyers,

865
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,589
You certainly have
plenty of them around.

866
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,693
They're like
nuclear warheads.

867
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:37,663
They have theirs,
so i have mine.

868
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:40,231
Once you use them,
they fuck up everything.

869
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,600
Let me ask you.

870
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,770
Do you have authorization
to offer me greenmail?

871
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:49,207
Of course not.

872
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:51,643
It's a lawyer's scheme.

873
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:53,411
Everybody
walks out happy.

874
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:55,413

keep their yobs.

877

The lawyer
gets a big fat fee.

00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:06,324
Everybody walks out.

879
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:08,694
Sounds
pretty good to me.

880
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:10,328
Except
for the stockholders.

881
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:11,697
Their stock
falls out of bed,

882
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:12,698
They don't know
what hit 'em.

883
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:15,701
Now you're
albert schweitzer.

884
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:18,804
No, not albert schweitzer,
robin hood.

885
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:21,873
I take from the rich
and i give to the middle class.

886
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:25,210
Well, the upper middle class.
Would you care for some caviar?

887
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,244
The stock is 18.

888
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:27,445
Do you like music?
Do you like the violin?

889
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:28,546
Let's be serious.

890
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,481
Come on, let's change
the subject.

891
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:31,683

892
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:34,720
The stock is 18.
We'll buy it back at 18.

893
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,288
First you laugh at me,
then you insult me.

894
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,357
Then name your number.
What will you take?

895
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:40,458
25.

896
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,761
The stock hasn't seen 25
in years.

897
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:44,963
You want history?

00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,430
Go home, bill.
Have a drink.

1079
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:47,598
Give my best
to jeanette.

1080
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,468
I don't want the rug
pulled out from under me

1081
00:52:50,468 --> 00:52:52,470
So close
to the finish line.

1082
00:52:53,938 --> 00:52:54,939
Good night.

1083
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,075
Jorgy, i've been here
15 years.

1084
00:52:58,075 --> 00:53:00,711
I have a family.
Something's due me.

1085
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:02,513
Now, i've worked
my ass off for 15 years,

1086
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,881
And you're going
to let that man come in

1087
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:05,583
And take over the
company. It's not right.

1088
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,321
I'm sorry, bill.

1089
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:12,557
Up here we don't
plan the funeral

1090
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:14,625
Until the body is dead.

1091
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:23,768
[Talking and shouting]

1092
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:27,338
Sounds like
everybody's hungry.

1093
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:29,307
Well, let's eat.

1094
00:53:29,307 --> 00:53:31,008
Sit down, darling.

1095
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:32,977
Happy thanksgiving.

1096
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,178
Happy
thanksgiving.

1097
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:36,447
[Ting ting]

1098
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:38,916
Thank thee, father,
for thy care,

1099
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,184
For thy bounty everywhere.

1100
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:41,686
For this
and every other gift,

1101
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:45,856
Our grateful hearts
to thee we lift. Amen.

1102
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,303
2nd down and 10.
Lions at their 49.

1103
00:53:58,303 --> 00:54:01,306
I don't know why
you watch this.

1104
00:54:01,306 --> 00:54:02,707
It's so stupid.

1105
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:04,909
If you watch,
you'll see.

1106
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,311
Yes! Go! Go! Go!

1107
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:09,514
I told you. My money
was on detroit.

1108
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,334
You have to admit

1109
00:54:29,334 --> 00:54:32,337
We still have fresh air
up here.

1110
00:54:32,337 --> 00:54:33,938
Feels good, all right.

1111
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:39,644
I'm awfully glad
you came, kate.

1112
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:42,012
It means a hell of a lot
to your mother.

1113
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,416
I love your mother.

1114
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:47,352
I can't say
i'm sorry for that,

1115
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:50,455
But i am sorry
for whatever it is

1116
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:53,958
It's done to you
in the last 21-Odd years.

1117
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,093
I'm ok, jorgy.

1118
00:54:56,927 --> 00:55:00,531
Good. Now let's talk
a little business.

1119
00:55:00,531 --> 00:55:03,534
Let's quit talking
about what i won't do.

1120
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:06,704
Let's talk about
what i will do.

1121
00:55:08,373 --> 00:55:10,441
I have a problem.

1122
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:13,378
I'm a good lawyer.
I'm a lousy mind reader.

1123
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:15,380
I want to put it
to a vote.

1124
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,781
Annual meeting
in four weeks.

1125
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:19,784
Want to put it in the hands
of the stockholders.

1126
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:21,786
Can't do that.
It's too risky.

1127
00:55:21,786 --> 00:55:22,987
We could lose
everything.

1128
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,121
You're a fighter.

1129
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:25,423
I'm a fighter.

1130
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:26,724
It's too dangerous.

1131
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:30,728
There's no other choice
that i can live with.

1132
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:34,699
This 30%,
this faithful 30%.

1133
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:37,134
Can you absolutely
count on them?

1134
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:40,137
They haven't let me down
so far.

1135
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:43,140
Awful lot of ozzies
on our side.

1136
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,443
Don't trust ozzie.
He's a banker.

1137
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:47,945
I have to trust
my friends, kate.

1138
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:56,253
This is going
to be tough.

1139
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:59,256
I have to get garfield
to buy this.

1140
00:55:59,256 --> 00:56:01,325
He won't want to.

1141
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:03,060
It's not
to his advantage.

1142
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:08,165
Talk nice.

1143
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:10,835
Give him
your best smile.

1144
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:13,671
Come on, kate.

1145
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:18,108
Let's take on
the little son of a bitch.

1146
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:19,243
Let's kick his ass

1147
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:21,879
All the way back
to wall street.

1148
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,040
Yeah.

1149
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,442
It's a quiet place.

1150
00:56:51,442 --> 00:56:54,445
I thought it would be
a good idea

1151
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:57,047
If we calmed down a bit.

1152
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:58,449
Do you like japanese?

1153
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:00,451
I'd like to have sony.

1154
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:04,054
Could you bring me
a knife and fork, please?

1155
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:05,055
Hai.

1156
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:11,629
So, what do you say?

1157
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:16,501
A proxy fight?
I--I'd have to be nuts.

1158
00:57:16,501 --> 00:57:18,769
I could just sit
on my ass

1159
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,237
And wait for the injunction
to lift,

1160
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:21,706
Buy all the shares i need.

1161
00:57:21,706 --> 00:57:24,675
Anybody else,
i wouldn't even come to lunch.

1162
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:27,778
You look very nice today.

1163
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,714
But if you win,
lawrence,

1164
00:57:29,714 --> 00:57:31,716
It speeds up
the process.

1165
00:57:31,716 --> 00:57:34,719
You get what you want
in three months

1166
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,821
Instead of a year,
maybe two.

1167
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:39,557
I love it
when you call me lawrence.

1168
00:57:39,557 --> 00:57:41,158
Say it again.

1169
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:47,798
There's a lot can stand
in your way, lawrence.

1170
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,800
Anti-Takeover legislation's
in the works.

1171
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,402
Drexel's gone under.
Milken's in jail.

1172
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,004
Trump's waiting tables.

1173
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:55,640
Don't threaten me.

1174
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,642
And just maybe
you're overleveraged

1175
00:57:57,642 --> 00:58:00,377
And you can't afford
to wait.

1176
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:02,913
Thank you.
You got any bread?

1177
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:03,914
No bread.

1178
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:04,915
No bread.

1179
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,317
They got no bread.

1180
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,186
They want to
run the world,

1181
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:10,988
They got no bread.

1182
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:15,826
In three weeks, you
present your own slate.

1183
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,195
If you win, you
buy everybody out at 20.

1184
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:19,096
If you lose,

1185
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:21,065
You sell us back
your shares at 15.

1186
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:22,066
Worst case scenario--

1187
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:24,735
You still make
a couple million.

1188
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:27,304
Amazing people,
the japanese.

1189
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:29,640
We blow the hell
out of them.

1190
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,676
They go back to school,
learn english,

1191
00:58:31,676 --> 00:58:33,310
And start
to run the world.

1192
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,713
What do we do?
We get big-Headed,

1193
00:58:35,713 --> 00:58:37,715
Start living
the good life,

1194
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:39,116
Forget about schools.

1195
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:41,318
People can't read.
People can't write.

1196
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:42,920
Country's full of dropouts.

1197
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,789
Education.

1198
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:46,591
Who needs education

1199
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:48,726
As long as you can
blow up the world?

1200
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:50,527
Meanwhile, i got
everybody in my office

1201
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,062
Learning japanese.

1202
00:58:54,899 --> 00:58:57,602
I've never seen
such a beautiful lawyer.

1203
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:01,038
Come on, lawrence.

1204
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,707
This is your game.

1205
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:06,243
Winner takes all.

1206
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:12,049
Rumor has it
you got balls.

1207
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:16,520
I been trying
to show you for weeks.

1208
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,156
Well, here's
your opportunity.

1209
00:59:22,026 --> 00:59:23,027
All right.

1210
00:59:23,027 --> 00:59:26,263
I can always use
a good proxy blood bath.

1211
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:29,066
After all, i want to
give you a fighting chance.

1212
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:30,567
I love ya.

1213
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,072
Of course you do...

1214
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,610
Because we're the same.

1215
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:42,980
We are not the same,
lawrence.

1216
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,582
Now, don't go
spreading that around.

1217
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,484
You know what makes us
the same,

1218
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:49,987
What sets us apart?

1219
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:52,222
We care more
about the game

1220
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:54,625
Than we do the players.

1221
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:57,628
Oh, is that so?

1222
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:02,066
Yeah...that's so.

1223
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:17,782
I'm going to nail you,
lawrence,

1224
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:19,784
And everybody
on wall street's

1225
01:00:19,784 --> 01:00:22,953
Gonna know how
some broad did you in.

1226
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:26,590
Ooh...

1227
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:30,027
You're so perfect for me.

1228
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,331
I have to go.

1229
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:35,766
Don't go.

1230
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:39,303
Lunch is on me,
babypoo.

1231
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:43,674
Where you going?

1232
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:46,010
I have to go back
to the office.

1233
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,945
Don't go back
to the office.

1234
01:00:47,945 --> 01:00:49,947
Come and work for me.

1235
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:56,887
[Speaking japanese]

1236
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,494
Lady said to say
we have no doughnuts.

1237
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,831
[Speaking japanese]

1238
01:01:08,933 --> 01:01:11,335
[Speaking japanese]

1239
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,860
Here's your coffee,
boss.

1240
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,602
You make me feel
like a "doity" crook.

1241
01:01:45,602 --> 01:01:48,939
Sneaking off to jersey
is not my style.

1242
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:53,710
Can we speak frankly?

1243
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,113
No. Lie to me.

1244
01:01:56,113 --> 01:01:59,016
Tell me how thrilled
you are to know me.

1245
01:01:59,016 --> 01:02:00,450
I always
speak frankly.

1246
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:04,088
I hate people who say,
"can we speak frankly?"

1247
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:07,892
It means they're bullshitting
me the rest of the time.

1248
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:10,494
I'm listening.

1249
01:02:14,965 --> 01:02:20,037
Now...as you know,
i had 60,000 shares

1250
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:23,140
Of new england stock
when we first met.

1251
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,709
What am i getting,
a history lesson here?

1252
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:26,911
Get to the point.

1253
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:29,646
Since...

1254
01:02:29,646 --> 01:02:32,850
Becoming aware
of your...investments,

1255
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,120
I bought an additional
40,000 shares.

1256
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:39,256
I now have
100,000 shares.

1257
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,191
Congratulations.

1258
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,029
I'm prepared...

1259
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:49,867
To sell you the right...

1260
01:02:49,867 --> 01:02:53,938
To vote those shares
at the annual meeting.

1261
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:56,306
How much?

1262
01:02:59,844 --> 01:03:01,445
A million.

1263
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:02,446
Too much.

1264
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,781
You need a million shares

1265
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,783
More than
you already own.

1266
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,820
Now i can get you 10%
of the way there

1267
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,121
In one transaction.

1268
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:14,258
Better still, it's votes
they're counting on

1269
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:15,059
For themselves.

1270
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:18,028
They lose 10%,
you gain 10%.

1271
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:20,197
If you make a difference,

1272
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:23,200
If i win by less than
100,000 votes,

1273
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,835
You got your million.
Otherwise...

1274
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:26,971
I don't need them,
i won't vote them.

1275
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:29,106
I'm not selling you
an option.

1276
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:31,208
I'm selling you the right
to vote the shares.

1277
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:32,776
If they make
a difference,

1278
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:34,111
You got a million.

1279

You can have your lawyers
look at them.

for their own self-Interest,

1284

Don't they?

"What's in it for me?"

1286
01:03:57,467 --> 01:04:00,104

finally all about?

1287
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,156
Yes. Very good.
Very good.

No, she didn't.

01:06:18,175 --> 01:06:20,177
She'd be very upset
with me if she knew.

1324
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,081
I like kate. She's
quite the tomato.

1325

She must have taken

You're very kind.

I would hope this meeting
will be held in confidence.

a cup of coffee?

Cup of tea?
Glass of water?

You needn't be sociable,
mr. Garfield.

a cup of coffee.

I'm here to plead
for our company.

for a doughnut,

Mrs. Sullivan?

1342
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:13,263
We've worked so hard
to build this company.

1343

We're debt-Free,

1344

to lose it.

I want you to call off
your fight with us.

if you'll go away.

You don't want to
do that.

your shares at cost,

$1 million profit.

I know $1 million
isn't much money to you,

1354

But if i had more,
i'd give it to you.

Who are you
doing it for?

1356

Money's not
that important to me.

will you, bart?

1426
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:36,660
I've got to go.

1427
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:39,295
The opera.
La traviata.

1428
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,397
You don't want to miss
the first act.

1429
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:41,965
It sets up
the whole thing.

1430
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:58,715
It's a wonderful
production.

1431
01:12:02,419 --> 01:12:04,020
Have a good time.

1432
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,670
I'm going to lose her,
arthur.

1433
01:12:57,073 --> 01:12:59,776
* good king wenceslaus
looked out *

1434
01:12:59,776 --> 01:13:02,812
* on the feast of stephen *

1435
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:05,615
* when the snow lay
'round about *

1436
01:13:05,615 --> 01:13:08,351
* deep and crisp
and even *

1437
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:11,488
* brightly shone the moon
that night

1438
01:13:11,488 --> 01:13:14,090
* though the frost
was cruel... **

1439
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:29,272
Oh, i've been looking
for you.

1440
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:31,475
Any time you're ready.

1441
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:35,745
You ok?

1442
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,614
Yeah.

1443
01:13:37,614 --> 01:13:39,282
Just going over
in my mind

1444
01:13:39,282 --> 01:13:40,750
What i want to say.

1445
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,352
They're putting
speakers outside.

1446
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,788
I think
every shareholder

1447
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:47,657
Within driving distance
is coming.

1448
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:49,993
I feel as if
we're harry and bess

1449
01:13:49,993 --> 01:13:51,394
On election night.

1450
01:13:51,394 --> 01:13:53,262
Harry truman
was a better man than me.

1451
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,131
He slept
on election night.

1452
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:57,767
I haven't slept in days.

1453
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:01,905
Talk to me.
Tell me.

1454
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,510
I'm scared.

1455
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,947
I'm scared that...

1456
01:14:12,682 --> 01:14:15,051
Time has passed us by.

1457
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:20,957
I'm scared i don't know
this new environment.

1458
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:23,793
I'm scared
that what i do know

1459
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:26,162
Doesn't count
for anything anymore.

1460
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:28,197
Things have changed.

1461
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:30,567
Whatever happened

1462
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:33,236
To people serving
each other?

1463
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:40,176
I don't want
this man to win.

1464
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:46,550
I'm not scared.
I'm just proud.

1465
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:51,454
I'm proud of the
business we've built.

1466
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:55,124
I'm so proud of you.

1467
01:14:55,124 --> 01:14:56,726
And if what we are

1468
01:14:56,726 --> 01:14:58,394
Counts for nothing
anymore,

1469
01:14:58,394 --> 01:15:01,531
Then that's their
failing, not ours.

1470
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,035
It'll be all right.

1471
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:10,139
Just go out
and tell the truth.

1472
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:15,945
Go out and give 'em
hell, harry.

1473
01:15:19,115 --> 01:15:20,516
[Water spills]

1474
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,686
[Laughing]

1475
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,189
Good luck to us all
today, bill.

1476
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:29,125
I feel we're going
to be just fine.

1477
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:37,100
Looks like they've come
from everywhere--

1478
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,534
New york, boston.

1479
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,003
There's ozzie.

1480
01:15:40,003 --> 01:15:42,171
Happening all over,
isn't it?

1481
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:45,909
Everybody looking out
for themselves.

1482
01:15:48,912 --> 01:15:51,915
So, did you get your
golden parachute, bill?

1483
01:15:51,915 --> 01:15:55,051
Did he finally promise
to take care of you?

1484
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:58,054
Lord of the manor,
house on the hill.

1485
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:01,658
Said he didn't want
to talk about a funeral

1486
01:16:01,658 --> 01:16:04,260
While there was
no corpse.

1487
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,639
Well, time to go.

1488
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:18,574
Bill.

1489
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:23,112
How are you
going to vote?

1490
01:16:43,232 --> 01:16:45,702
Oh, boy. They're out
in droves, arthur.

1491
01:16:45,702 --> 01:16:47,103
They got the kids here.

1492
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:49,806
Why do they always
bring the kids, arthur?

1493
01:16:52,642 --> 01:16:55,244
That's right--
Hooray, hooray.

1494
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:57,213
Down with garfield.

1495
01:16:57,213 --> 01:16:59,148
[Horns honk]

1496
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:09,959
Ok, tv crews.

1497
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:12,729
Financial news network,
here we come.

1498
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:14,864
[Shouting]

1499
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:19,568
Mr. Garfield!

1500
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:20,970
What are your plans

1501
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:23,572
For new england
wire and cable?

1502
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:24,974
Make the stockholders
richer.

1503
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:26,575
Will you liquidate
new england wire and cable?

1504
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:28,745
And if so,
what about the workers?

1505
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:31,147
My obligation
is to the stockholders.

1506
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,783
The board of directors
make that decision.

1507
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:41,157
Will they lose
their jobs?

1508
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:43,259
Come on,
answer the question.

1509
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:44,894
Come on, mr. Garfield!

1510
01:17:44,894 --> 01:17:46,495
How do you
feel about

1511
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,664
The outcome of
today's proxy vote?

1512
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,066
I feel confident

1513
01:17:50,066 --> 01:17:52,501
That the shareholders
will vote their consciences.

1514
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,804
I have every confidence
in this company's future.

1515
01:18:35,011 --> 01:18:37,747
Could i have
your attention, please?

1516
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:39,248
Welcome to...

1517
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:43,286
New england wire and cable's
annual stockholders' meeting.

1518
01:18:43,286 --> 01:18:45,889
I'm william j. Coles,
your president...

1519
01:18:45,889 --> 01:18:47,423
And i'm sure...

1520
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:48,357
[Applause]

1521
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:51,427
I'm sure
that everyone here realizes

1522
01:18:51,427 --> 01:18:53,462
The most important item
on the agenda is...

1523
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:56,632
The election
of the board of directors.

1524
01:18:56,632 --> 01:18:59,368
Now, there are
staff members

1525
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:01,771
Passing out the ballots.

1526
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:04,173
Right now,
i am very proud

1527
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:06,776
To introduce to you
a man

1528
01:19:06,776 --> 01:19:09,913
Who could accurately
be characterized

1529
01:19:09,913 --> 01:19:13,850
As a legend in the wire
and cable industry.

1530
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:15,785
The chairman of the board

1531
01:19:15,785 --> 01:19:18,087
Of new england
wire and cable,

1532
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,889
Mr. Andrew jorgenson.

1533
01:19:19,889 --> 01:19:22,091
[Applause]

1534
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:44,080
Give 'em hell, andy!

1535
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:48,217
It's good to see
so many...

1536
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:51,154
Familiar faces,
so many old friends.

1537
01:19:51,154 --> 01:19:53,823
Some of you
i haven't seen in years.

1538
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:55,424
[Laughter]

1539
01:19:55,424 --> 01:19:57,894
Thank you for coming.

1540
01:19:57,894 --> 01:19:59,462
Bill coles,
our able president,

1541
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:03,766
In the annual report
has told you of our year,

1542
01:20:03,766 --> 01:20:05,168
Of what we accomplished,

1543
01:20:05,168 --> 01:20:06,402
Of the need
for further improvements,

1544
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:09,005
Our business goals
for next year

1545
01:20:09,005 --> 01:20:11,307
And the years beyond.

1546
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:19,815
I'd like to talk to you
about something else.

1547
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:24,420
I want to share with you
some of my thoughts

1548
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,056
Concerning the vote
that you're going to make

1549
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:30,393
In the company
that you own.

1550
01:20:30,393 --> 01:20:32,128
This proud company,

1551
01:20:32,128 --> 01:20:36,132
Which has survived
the death of its founder,

1552
01:20:36,132 --> 01:20:37,600
Numerous recessions,

1553
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:38,935
One major depression,

1554
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:41,370
And two world wars,

1555
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:48,077
Is in imminent danger
of self-Destructing...

1556
01:20:48,077 --> 01:20:52,415
On this day,
in the town of its birth.

1557
01:20:56,552 --> 01:21:01,124
There is the instrument
of our destruction.

1558
01:21:01,124 --> 01:21:04,760
I want you to look at him
in all of his glory--

1559
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,163
Larry the liquidator.

1560
01:21:07,163 --> 01:21:11,100
The entrepreneur of
post-Industrial america

1561
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:15,871
Playing god
with other people's money.

1562
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:19,575
The robber barons of old

1563
01:21:19,575 --> 01:21:24,047
At least left something
tangible in their wake--

1564
01:21:24,047 --> 01:21:27,917
A coal mine,
a railroad, banks.

1565
01:21:27,917 --> 01:21:29,919
This man leaves nothing.

1566
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:32,488
He creates nothing.

1567
01:21:32,488 --> 01:21:34,057
He builds nothing.

1568
01:21:34,057 --> 01:21:36,259
He runs nothing.

1569
01:21:37,693 --> 01:21:40,096
And in his wake
lies nothing

1570
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,098
But a blizzard
of paper

1571
01:21:42,098 --> 01:21:43,699
To cover the pain.

1572
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:46,102
Oh, if he said,

1573
01:21:46,102 --> 01:21:49,105
"I know how to run your
business better than you,"

1574
01:21:49,105 --> 01:21:52,775
That would be something
worth talking about.

1575
01:21:52,775 --> 01:21:54,944
But he's not saying that.

1576
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:57,113
He's saying,
"i'm going to kill you

1577
01:21:57,113 --> 01:22:00,416
"Because at this particular
moment in time,

1578
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:03,552
You're worth more
dead than alive."

1579
01:22:03,552 --> 01:22:05,488
Well...

1580
01:22:05,488 --> 01:22:06,889
Maybe that's true,

1581
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:09,092
But it is also true

1582
01:22:09,092 --> 01:22:13,696
That one day
this industry will turn,

1583
01:22:13,696 --> 01:22:16,665
One day when
the yen is weaker,

1584
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:18,634
The dollar is stronger,

1585
01:22:18,634 --> 01:22:23,106
Or when we finally begin
to rebuild our roads,

1586
01:22:23,106 --> 01:22:24,373
Our bridges,

1587
01:22:24,373 --> 01:22:27,076
The infrastructure
of our country,

1588
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:28,677
Demand will skyrocket.

1589
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:30,679
And when
those things happen,

1590
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:33,249
We will still be here,

1591
01:22:33,249 --> 01:22:35,851
Stronger because of
our ordeal,

1592
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:38,988
Stronger because
we have survived.

1593
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:41,390
And the price
of our stock

1594
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:45,594
Will make his offer
pale by comparison.

1595
01:22:45,594 --> 01:22:46,795
God save us

1596
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:51,867
If we vote to take his
paltry few dollars and run.

1597
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:54,303
God save this country

1598
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:57,940
If that is truly
the wave of the future.

1599
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,875
We will then
have become a nation

1600
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:01,477
That makes nothing
but hamburgers,

1601
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:03,112
Creates nothing
but lawyers,

1602
01:23:03,112 --> 01:23:06,415
And sells nothing
but tax shelters.

1603
01:23:06,415 --> 01:23:08,884
And if we are
at that point

1604
01:23:08,884 --> 01:23:10,753
In this country

1605
01:23:10,753 --> 01:23:11,820
Where we kill something

1606
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,023
Because at the moment

1607
01:23:14,023 --> 01:23:16,625
It's worth more
dead than alive,

1608
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,527
Well,

1609
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:20,163
Take a look around.

1610
01:23:20,163 --> 01:23:22,165
Look at your neighbor.
Look at your neighbor.

1611
01:23:22,165 --> 01:23:24,433
You won't kill him,
will you?

1612
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:25,634
No.

1613
01:23:25,634 --> 01:23:27,736
It's called murder,

1614
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,138
And it's illegal.

1615
01:23:29,138 --> 01:23:31,140
Well, this, too,
is murder,

1616
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,008
On a mass scale.

1617
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,444
Only on wall street,

1618
01:23:35,444 --> 01:23:39,648
They call it
maximizing shareholder value.

1619
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,450
And they call it legal.

1620
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:43,452
And they substitute
dollar bills

1621
01:23:43,452 --> 01:23:46,089
Where a conscience
should be.

1622
01:23:46,922 --> 01:23:48,324
Damn it!

1623
01:23:48,324 --> 01:23:51,127
A business
is worth more

1624
01:23:51,127 --> 01:23:53,262
Than the price
of its stock.

1625
01:23:53,262 --> 01:23:56,265
It's the place
where we earn our living,

1626
01:23:56,265 --> 01:23:58,267
Where we meet
our friends,

1627
01:23:58,267 --> 01:23:59,868
Dream our dreams.

1628
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,670
It is, in every sense,

1629
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:06,242
The very fabric that binds
our society together.

1630
01:24:06,242 --> 01:24:09,245
So let us now,
at this meeting,

1631
01:24:09,245 --> 01:24:13,216
Say to every garfield
in the land,

1632
01:24:13,216 --> 01:24:16,852
Here we build things,

1633
01:24:16,852 --> 01:24:18,421
We don't destroy them.

1634
01:24:18,421 --> 01:24:20,823
Here we care about more

1635
01:24:20,823 --> 01:24:23,492
Than the price
of our stock.

1636
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:29,098
Here...we care
about people.

1637
01:24:29,098 --> 01:24:31,300
[Cheering]

1638
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,557
Thank you.

1639
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:58,727
And now i'd like
to introduce

1640
01:24:58,727 --> 01:25:00,129
Mr. Lawrence garfield.

1641
01:25:00,129 --> 01:25:02,131
[Booing and hissing]

1642
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:04,500
Excuse me--Please.

1643
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:07,503
Let's show a little courtesy,
ladies and gentlemen.

1644
01:25:07,503 --> 01:25:10,573
Mr. Garfield
is the president

1645
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:12,441
And the chairman
of the board of...

1646
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:14,610
Garfield investments.

1647
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,545
Mr. Garfield.

1648
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:19,448
[Booing]

1649
01:25:28,691 --> 01:25:30,893
No!
No!

1650
01:25:30,893 --> 01:25:32,895
[Booing]

1651
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:37,233
Get out of here!

1652
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:39,868
Amen.

1653
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:43,739
And amen.

1654
01:25:43,739 --> 01:25:45,441
And amen.

1655
01:25:45,441 --> 01:25:47,109
You have to forgive me.

1656
01:25:47,109 --> 01:25:50,078
I'm not familiar
with the local custom.

1657
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:51,814
Where i come from,

1658
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:55,117
You always say amen
after you hear a prayer.

1659
01:25:55,117 --> 01:25:58,621
Because that's
what you just heard.

1660
01:25:58,621 --> 01:25:59,722
A prayer.

1661
01:26:01,924 --> 01:26:03,592
Where i come from...

1662
01:26:04,727 --> 01:26:07,463
That particular prayer
is called

1663
01:26:07,463 --> 01:26:09,665
The prayer for the dead.

1664
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:15,070
You just heard
the prayer for the dead,

1665
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:17,139
My fellow stockholders,

1666
01:26:17,139 --> 01:26:18,807
And you didn't say amen.

1667
01:26:20,476 --> 01:26:23,178
This company is dead.

1668
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,813
I didn't kill it.

1669
01:26:24,813 --> 01:26:26,215
Don't blame me.

1670
01:26:26,215 --> 01:26:28,851
It was dead
when i got here.

1671
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:34,957
It's too late
for prayers.

1672
01:26:37,293 --> 01:26:40,296
For even if
the prayers were answered

1673
01:26:40,296 --> 01:26:42,197
And a miracle occurred

1674
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,799
And the yen did this

1675
01:26:43,799 --> 01:26:45,234
And the dollar did that

1676
01:26:45,234 --> 01:26:46,969
And the infrastructure
did the other thing,

1677
01:26:46,969 --> 01:26:49,104
We'd still be dead.

1678
01:26:49,104 --> 01:26:51,374
You know why?

1679
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:54,410
Fiber optics.

1680
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,446
New technologies.

1681
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,317
Obsolescence.

1682
01:27:02,851 --> 01:27:04,453
We're dead, all right.

1683
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:06,889
We're just not broke.

1684
01:27:06,889 --> 01:27:07,690
And do you know

1685
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:10,058
The surest way
to go broke?

1686
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:12,861
Keep getting
an increasing share

1687
01:27:12,861 --> 01:27:14,463
Of a shrinking market.

1688
01:27:14,463 --> 01:27:16,432
Down the tubes.

1689
01:27:16,432 --> 01:27:19,368
Slow but sure.

1690
01:27:19,368 --> 01:27:20,803
You know,

1691
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:22,305
At one time,
there must have been

1692
01:27:22,305 --> 01:27:25,808
Dozens of companies
making buggy whips.

1693
01:27:25,808 --> 01:27:29,978
And i'll bet
the last company around

1694
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:31,213
Was the one that made

1695
01:27:31,213 --> 01:27:34,016
The best goddamn buggy whip
you ever saw.

1696
01:27:34,016 --> 01:27:35,484
Now, how would you
have liked

1697
01:27:35,484 --> 01:27:37,286
To have been a stockholder
in that company?

1698
01:27:37,286 --> 01:27:41,056
You invested
in a business,

1699
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,125
And this business
is dead.

1700
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:44,993
Let's have
the intelligence,

1701
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:46,695
Let's have the decency

1702
01:27:46,695 --> 01:27:48,897
To sign
the death certificate,

1703
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:50,299
Collect the insurance,

1704
01:27:50,299 --> 01:27:53,902
And invest in something
with a future.

1705
01:27:53,902 --> 01:27:56,472
"Ahh, but we can't,"

1706
01:27:56,472 --> 01:27:58,273
Goes the prayer.

1707
01:27:59,675 --> 01:28:02,678
We can't because
we have a responsibility,

1708
01:28:02,678 --> 01:28:06,281
A responsibility
to our employees,

1709
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:07,683
To our community.

1710
01:28:07,683 --> 01:28:09,952
What will happen
to them?

1711
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:12,888
I got two words for that.

1712
01:28:12,888 --> 01:28:15,958
Who cares?

1713
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:17,560
Care about them?

1714
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,361
Why?

1715
01:28:18,361 --> 01:28:21,129
They didn't care
about you.

1716
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,565
They sucked you dry.

1717
01:28:22,565 --> 01:28:26,201
You have no
responsibility to them.

1718
01:28:26,201 --> 01:28:27,803
For the last 10 years,

1719
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:30,673
This company
bled your money.

1720
01:28:30,673 --> 01:28:32,708
Did this community
ever say,

1721
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:35,478
"We know
times are tough--

1722
01:28:35,478 --> 01:28:38,947
We'll lower taxes,
reduce water and sewer"?

1723
01:28:38,947 --> 01:28:40,349
Check it out.

1724
01:28:40,349 --> 01:28:43,352
You're paying twice
what you did 10 years ago.

1725
01:28:43,352 --> 01:28:44,820
And our devoted employees

1726
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:48,424
Who've taken no increases
for the past three years

1727
01:28:48,424 --> 01:28:51,860
Are still making twice
what they made 10 years ago.

1728
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:53,195
And our stock--

1729
01:28:53,195 --> 01:28:56,832
1/6 what it was
10 years ago.

1730
01:28:59,368 --> 01:29:00,969
Who cares?

1731
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,872
I'll tell you.

1732
01:29:03,872 --> 01:29:05,474
Me.

1733
01:29:06,475 --> 01:29:09,478
I'm not your best friend.

1734
01:29:09,478 --> 01:29:12,548
I'm your only friend.

1735
01:29:14,216 --> 01:29:16,985
I don't make anything?

1736
01:29:16,985 --> 01:29:18,421
I'm making you money.

1737
01:29:18,421 --> 01:29:19,822
And lest we forget,

1738
01:29:19,822 --> 01:29:22,491
That's the only reason
any of you

1739
01:29:22,491 --> 01:29:25,093
Became stockholders
in the first place.

1740
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:26,495
You want to make money.

1741
01:29:26,495 --> 01:29:28,897
You don't care
if they manufacture

1742
01:29:28,897 --> 01:29:31,099
Wire and cable,
fried chicken,

1743
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:32,501
Or grow tangerines!

1744
01:29:32,501 --> 01:29:36,171
You want to make money!

1745
01:29:36,171 --> 01:29:39,241
I'm the only friend
you've got.

1746
01:29:39,241 --> 01:29:41,577
I'm making you money.

1747
01:29:41,577 --> 01:29:44,179
Take the money.

1748
01:29:44,179 --> 01:29:46,081
Invest it somewhere else.

1749
01:29:47,149 --> 01:29:48,283
Maybe...

1750
01:29:48,283 --> 01:29:49,685
Maybe you'll get lucky,

1751
01:29:49,685 --> 01:29:51,887
And it'll be used
productively.

1752
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:54,122
And if it is,

1753
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:55,524
You'll create new jobs

1754
01:29:55,524 --> 01:29:57,526
And provide a service
for the economy

1755
01:29:57,526 --> 01:29:59,027
And, god forbid,

1756
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:01,864
Even make a few bucks
for yourselves.

1757
01:30:01,864 --> 01:30:04,266
[Laughter]

1758
01:30:04,266 --> 01:30:06,535
And if anybody asks,

1759
01:30:06,535 --> 01:30:09,505
Tell 'em you gave
at the plant.

1760
01:30:09,505 --> 01:30:11,039
[Laughter]

1761
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:12,407
And by the way,

1762
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:16,144
It pleases me
that i am called

1763
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:19,381
Larry the liquidator.

1764
01:30:19,381 --> 01:30:21,283
You know why,
fellow stockholders?

1765
01:30:21,283 --> 01:30:23,418
Because at my funeral,

1766
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,688
You'll leave with
a smile on your face

1767
01:30:25,688 --> 01:30:28,691
And a few bucks
in your pocket.

1768
01:30:28,691 --> 01:30:31,426
Now, that's a funeral
worth having.

1769
01:30:45,908 --> 01:30:47,910
The ballots
will be marked

1770
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:50,278
And deposited
in the ballot boxes

1771
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:51,580
At the rear
of the hall.

1772
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:52,781
Thank you.

1773
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:18,941
Yeah.

1774
01:31:39,695 --> 01:31:43,298
Ladies and gentlemen,
please.

1775
01:31:44,132 --> 01:31:46,635
May i have
your attention, please?

1776
01:31:46,635 --> 01:31:48,604
I will now read

1777
01:31:48,604 --> 01:31:50,739
The results
of the balloting.

1778
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:05,520
To retain
the present board--

1779
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:10,559
1,741,416.

1780
01:32:10,559 --> 01:32:12,160
For the opposition--

1781
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:16,398
