00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,912
we're looking at a range of 32
to 34 a share. At 7.2 million a share...

533
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,596
that gives us a valuation of 868 million.

534

Hang on just a minute.

535
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,636
We have to get a billion-dollar valuation.

at the comparables, Ed, and...

You said 34 to 36 in your pitch.

You'll leave tens of millions
of dollars on the table.

No. So, what you want
to avoid here, Ed, is a down...

with your last IPO.

the right number for all of us.

- The number's 35.
- Possibly.

00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,479
But you can think of it like a...
Like a party.

554
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,910
We need to encourage people
to show up to the party.

555
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,912
It could be the best party in the world.

- A party?

With a 32 to 34 range,
we'll get people in the door.
