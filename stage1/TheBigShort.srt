00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:23,193
Hiya, Frank. How are the wife and kids?

3
00:01:23,276 --> 00:01:24,559
You know, for you, I'm considering

4
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:28,281
treasury bonds
and utility stocks. Smoke?

5
00:01:28,364 --> 00:01:30,450
<i>In the late '70s, banking wasn't a job</i>

6
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:33,036
<i>you went into
to make large sums of money.</i>

7
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:35,663
<i>It was a fucking snooze.</i>

8
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:37,540
<i>How about those Mats'?</i>

9
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:40,293
<i>Filled with losers.
Like selling insurance or</i>

10
00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:41,711
accounting.

11
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:42,921
And if banking was boring,

12
00:01:43,046 --> 00:01:45,715
then the bond department at the bank
was straight-up comatose.

13
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:47,926
<i>We all know about bonds.</i>

14
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,129
<i>You give them to your
snot-nosed kid when he turns 15.</i>

15
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:52,180
Maybe when he's 30
he makes a hundred bucks.

16
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:53,556
Boring.

17
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,440
That is, until Lewis Ranieri
came on the scene

18
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:56,559
at Salomon Brothers.

19
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:04,734
You might not know who he is,
but he changed your life

20
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:08,571
<i>more than Michael Jordan, the iPod
and YouTube put together.</i>

21
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:12,273
All right, gentlemen!
Let's get some money in here!

22
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:15,787
Let's make some money!
What do you say?

23
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,705
<i>You see, Lewis didn't know it yet,</i>

24
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:19,707
<i>but he had already
changed banking forever</i>

25
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,000
<i>with one simple idea.</i>

26
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:26,464
The mortgage-backed security.
Or private-label MBS.

27
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:29,133
You've got your
average person's mortgage.

28
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:30,635
Fixed rate, 30 years.

29
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:34,055
Boring, safe, small payoff, right? But,

30
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:38,059
when you have thousands
of them all bundled together,

31
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:41,688
suddenly the yield goes up
but the risk is still small because,

32
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:42,731
well, they're mortgages!

33
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,305
And who the hell
doesn't pay their mortgage?

34
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:46,693
What exactly is the credit
rating on this bond?

35
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:49,612
This bond, gentlemen, is AAA-rated.

36
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:53,074
This is exactly what the Michigan state
pension fund has been looking for.

37
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:54,826
I'll buy $20 million.

38
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,370
- Oh, come on, live a little.
- $25 million.

39
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:00,873
<i>The money came raining down,</i>

40
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:02,458
<i>and for the first time,</i>

41
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:05,336
<i>the banker went
from the country club to the strip club.</i>

42
00:03:07,964 --> 00:03:11,175
<i>Pretty soon, stocks and savings
were almost inconsequential.</i>

43
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:13,511
<i>They were doing $50, $100, $200 billion</i>

44
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:17,557
<i>in mortgage bonds
and dozens of other securities a year.</i>

45
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:28,151
<i>And America barely noticed
as its number one industry</i>

46
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:30,320
<i>became boring old banking.</i>

47
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,493
<i>And then one day,
almost 30 years later, in 2008,</i>

48
00:03:38,703 --> 00:03:40,455
<i>it all came crashing down.</i>

49
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,336
<i>March. Bear Stearns
was in a death spiral</i>

50
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:47,837
<i>and the Fed brokered its sale.</i>

51
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,965
<i>It's been called the worst financial crisis
in modern times.</i>

52
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,553
<i>Certainly the largest financial disaster
in decades in this country,</i>

53
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:58,306
<i>and perhaps the end of an era
in American business.</i>

54
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:01,017
<i>In the end, Lewis Ranieri's
mortgage-backed security</i>

55
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,562
<i>mutated into a monstrosity that
collapsed the whole world economy.</i>

56
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:07,190
<i>And none of the experts
or leaders or talking heads</i>

57
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:08,566
<i>had a clue it was coming.</i>

58
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:13,029
<i>I'm guessing most of you
still don't really know what happened.</i>

59
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:16,397
<i>Yeah, you got a soundbite you repeat
so you don't sound dumb, but come on.</i>

60
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:19,118
Our financial institutions are strong.

61
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:22,497
<i>But there were some
who saw it coming.</i>

62
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,666
<i>While the whole world
was having a big old party,</i>

63
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:28,002
a <i>few outsiders and weirdos
saw what no one else could.</i>

64
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:31,673
<i>Not me. I'm not a weirdo.
I'm pretty fucking cool.</i>

65
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:33,758
<i>But we'll meet again later.</i>

66
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:37,011
<i>These outsiders saw the giant lie
at the heart of the economy.</i>

67
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:38,513
<i>And they saw it by doing something</i>

68
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:41,391
<i>the rest of the suckers
never thought to do.</i>

69
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:43,643
<i>They looked.</i>

70
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,783
<i>During the 1930s,</i>

71
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,081
the housing market
collapsed nationwide

72
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:08,584
by roughly 80%.

73
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:13,798
I mean, half of all mortgage debt
was in default.

74
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,551
And, I mean, there were very

75
00:05:17,677 --> 00:05:21,180
specific identifiers,
extremely recognizable.

76
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,143
I mean, for instance,

77
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:28,479
one of the hallmarks of mania

78
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:30,148
is the rapid rise

79
00:05:30,273 --> 00:05:32,316
in complexity and the rates of fraud.

80
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,820
And did you know that they're going up?

81
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:57,258
<i>I've always been</i>

82
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:59,343
<i>more comfortable alone.</i>

83
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:11,272
<i>I believe maybe
it's because of my glass eye.</i>

84
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:16,486
<i>I lost the eye in a childhood illness.</i>

85
00:06:20,823 --> 00:06:23,159
<i>It separates me from people.</i>

86
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:29,582
<i>And did you know that they are going</i>

87
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:30,792
Up?

88
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,378
The highest fraud rates since the 1930s.

89
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:36,798
Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay.

90
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:38,841
No, I didn't know that.

91
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:47,225
In 1933, the fourth year
of the Great Depression.

92
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,060
Let's wash it off and put it back in.

93
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:51,103
You were playing so great, son.

94
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,231
I even heard the coach say it.

95
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:56,651
Can we just go home?

96
00:06:56,734 --> 00:07:00,905
<i>Most social interactions
are awkward for me and for the person.</i>

97
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:04,492
<i>Even when I try
to compliment someone,</i>

98
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:05,952
<i>it comes out wrong.</i>

99
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:10,456
You have a very nice haircut.
Did you do it yourself?

100
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:12,542
What?

101
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,127
No. No, I...

102
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:25,596
I'm sorry. I'm just...

103
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,478
I'm going on and on.

104
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,313
My wife told me I need to share more.

105
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:38,109
- That seems healthy.
- Yeah.

106
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:52,290
So do I get the job?

107
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:54,750
I really think I could help your fund.

108
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:57,503
Yeah.

109
00:07:57,587 --> 00:07:59,213
Yeah, sure. Go on.

110
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:05,177
- You're...
- David. Great.

111
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:07,096
I guess I'll go find a desk.

112
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:09,765
Is there anything you want me
to work on for start...

113
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,186
Yeah.

114
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,110
You could let me know later.
I could come back.

115
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:23,237
Did you think it was strange when

116
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:25,823
the tech bubble burst in 2001

117
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:28,701
and the housing market in San Jose,

118
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:30,995
the tech capital of the world,

119
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:34,248
Went up?

120
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:36,375
- Wasn't that strange?
- No.

121
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:39,086
No, it's housing.
Housing is always stable.

122
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,212
Low risk. It's solid.

123
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:42,256
That's the idea, yeah.

124
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,091
I want you to get me

125
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:47,386
the top 20 selling mortgage bonds.

126
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,306
So you want to know what the top 20
selling mortgage bonds are?

127
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:54,727
No, no, no, I want to know
what mortgages are in each one.

128
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:59,106
Okay, aren't those
mortgages made up of...

129
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,650
Wait, aren't those bonds made up

130
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,777
of thousands and thousands
of mortgages?

131
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,320
Yeah.

132
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:09,867
Right away, Dr. Burry.

133
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:33,265
I am a nice guy all day long.

134
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:36,018
Ask anyone, I'm a pleasure to work with.

135
00:09:37,937 --> 00:09:42,274
But the second my son
screws up, I am...

136
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:45,444
...yelling at him
just like my dad did to me.

137
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:51,492
I hear the words that are
coming out of my mouth and...

138
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:54,370
Sorry I'm late! No cabs.

139
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,124
So, get this.

140
00:09:58,874 --> 00:10:01,377
I met with this retail banker yesterday.

141
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:04,046
I'm supposed to be getting him
to invest in a fund,

142
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,464
but instead

143
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:08,426
I start grilling him about
overdraft penalties

144
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:11,512
and how his bank will let
a customer write 10-12 checks

145
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:12,920
before they tell them they're overdrawn.

146
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,851
And this creep is making billions off
screwing over people this way.

147
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:18,728
And I'm getting madder and madder.

148
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:22,189
And I ask him,
I look him in the face and I say,

149
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:24,108
"How can you sleep at night"

150
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:28,070
"knowing that you are
ripping off working people?"

151
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:29,864
And you know what he did? He left.

152
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:32,658
He just walks out of the lunch,
doesn't say a word.

153
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:33,743
What the fuck is that?

154
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:36,162
Who's fucked up in that scenario? Am I?

155
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:38,706
Or is this douchebag,
who leaves me hanging?

156
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,041
Is he the fucked up one?

157
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:42,918
We have talked about
this numerous times.

158
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:46,130
You can't come in late
and hijack the entire session.

159
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:47,747
What do you mean?
I didn't hijack the meeting.

160
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:50,092
- Did I hijack the session?
- Yeah.

161
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:53,012
- What do you do?
- I'm in commodities.

162
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:54,388
Good luck with that.

163
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:58,059
Mark, I know
you suffered a terrible loss.

164
00:10:58,142 --> 00:10:59,560
Maybe you want to talk about that.

165
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:00,686
I don't talk about that.

166
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,188
Hold on.

167
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,606
Hold on...

168
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:06,525
Shit, I have to take this. Sorry. Sorry.

169
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:09,570
No... I don't care, Porter.

170
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:11,312
This guy's whole business
is built on ripping people off.

171
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:12,865
How long can that last?

172
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:15,534
Bye, everybody!

173
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:18,287
95...

174
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:20,664
That's 30 days late... Sixty days late...

175
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,628
They pay on time...

176
00:11:28,506 --> 00:11:30,132
These FICO scores...

177
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:38,849
<i>Late. And they caught up
on their payments...</i>

178
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:40,434
<i>Another 30 days late...</i>

179
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:43,771
<i>LTV, 95... LTV, 90...
They caught up on their payments...</i>

180
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:45,397
<i>Sixty days late? Jesus!</i>

181
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:47,608
<i>LTV, 110? I've never heard of that!</i>

182
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:49,026
<i>Thirty days late, rate adjusts...</i>

183
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:51,278
<i>In '07 rate adjusts...</i>

184
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:52,530
<i>In '06 rate adjusts...</i>

185
00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:54,949
<i>95... 90... Jesus!</i>

186
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:58,285
He hasn't moved all day.

187
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:00,704
He does this every few days.

188
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,456
He hasn't spoken to me
since he hired me.

189
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,958
<i>Maybe the LTV's at... High-risk,</i>

190
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,293
<i>interest-only... I never heard
of that mortgage history,</i>

191
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:09,130
<i>I never heard of that... How?</i>

192
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:10,506
Michael, how are you, guy?

193
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:13,634
<i>Lawrence, I found
something really interesting.</i>

194
00:12:13,717 --> 00:12:15,709
Great, Michael. Whenever you
find something interesting,

195
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:16,929
<i>we all tend to make money.</i>

196
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:19,849
<i>- What stock are you valuing?
- No, no, no, no. No stocks.</i>

197
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:21,976
I want to short the housing market.

198
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:26,063
Really? But the housing market
is rock solid.

199
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:27,982
<i>Greenspan just said</i>

200
00:12:28,065 --> 00:12:30,609
<i>bubbles are regional, defaults are rare.</i>

201
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:32,862
Tell them I'll be there in a minute.

202
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:34,738
- Say again?
- <i>Look, look...</i>

203
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,657
Greenspan's wrong.

204
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,161
<i>I don't think you mean to do this,
but sometimes you sound very</i>

205
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:42,538
dismissive and superior.

206
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:43,861
It's a fact. Greenspan's wrong.

207
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:46,208
I don't know
how else you want me to say...

208
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:47,668
Look, Michael.

209
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:49,378
Metro Capital backed you four years ago

210
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:51,255
<i>when you were a doctor with a</i>

211
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,674
dinky webpage
and some inheritance money.

212
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:54,758
<i>We've all done very well.</i>

213
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:56,041
Why don't you just stick with stocks?

214
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:58,179
<i>Look. You know me. I, I, I...</i>

215
00:12:58,262 --> 00:13:02,016
I look for value
wherever it can be found.

216
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:03,184
And the fact is

217
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:06,478
that these mortgage-backed
securities are filled

218
00:13:06,604 --> 00:13:10,024
<i>with extremely risky
subprime adjustable-rate loans.</i>

219
00:13:10,107 --> 00:13:12,610
<i>And when the majority
of the adjustable rates</i>

220
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:14,945
<i>kick in, in '07,</i>

221
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:16,280
they will begin to fail.

222
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:19,700
And if they fail above 15%,
the whole bond is worthless.

223
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:21,952
<i>Michael, just take a beat.</i>

224
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:23,319
<i>We'll talk about this later, okay?</i>

225
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:26,373
Lawrence, please,
don't patronize me. Listen...

226
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:27,917
<i>Mortgage-backed securities.</i>

227
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,711
- It, it, it...
<i>- Subprime loans. Tranches.</i>

228
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:32,963
<i>It's pretty confusing, right?</i>

229
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:35,674
<i>Does it make you feel bored?
Or stupid?</i>

230
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:38,052
<i>Well, it's supposed to.</i>

231
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:39,720
<i>Wall Street loves
to use confusing terms</i>

232
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:42,473
<i>to make you think only they
can do what they do.</i>

233
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:44,016
<i>Or, even better,</i>

234
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:46,477
<i>for you to just leave them
the fuck alone.</i>

235
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,688
<i>So here's Margot Robbie
in a bubble bath to explain.</i>

236
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:52,775
Basically, Lewis Ranieri's
mortgage bonds

237
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:55,152
were amazingly profitable
for the big banks.

238
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:59,198
They made billions and billions
on their 2% fee

239
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:01,492
they got for selling each of these bonds.

240
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,375
But then they started
running out of mortgages

241
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:04,995
to put in them.

242
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:07,748
After all, there are only so many homes

243
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:09,583
and so many people
with good enough jobs

244
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,585
to buy them, right?

245
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:13,754
So the banks started filling these bonds

246
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:16,006
with riskier and riskier mortgages.

247
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,258
Thank you, Benter.

248
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:21,887
That way they can keep
that profit machine churning, right?

249
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:26,350
By the way, these risky
mortgages are called subprime.

250
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,811
So whenever you hear "subprime", think

251
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:30,354
"shit".

252
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:33,983
Our friend Michael Burry found out
that these mortgage bonds

253
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:37,278
that were supposedly 65% AAA

254
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:40,114
were actually just mostly full of shit.

255
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:43,450
So now he's going to "short" the bonds.

256
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:45,536
Which means to "bet against".

257
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,413
Got it?

258
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:49,373
Good.

259
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,752
Now fuck off.

260
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:56,245
It's only a matter of time before
someone else sees this investment.

261
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,965
We have to act now!

262
00:14:58,048 --> 00:15:00,301
How do you know
the bonds are worthless?

263
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:02,594
Aren't they filled with fucking thousands

264
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:03,804
<i>of pages of mortgages?</i>

265
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:06,140
I read them.

266
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:08,142
- <i>You read them?</i>
- I read... yes.

267
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:11,437
No one reads them. Only the lawyers
who put them together read them.

268
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,233
Look, I don't think that they even know
what they've made.

269
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:19,611
The housing market
is propped up on these

270
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:22,573
bad loans, and I'm...

271
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,700
It's a time bomb, and I want to short it.

272
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:27,077
Through what instrument, Michael?

273
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:30,164
There are no insurance contracts
or options for mortgage bonds.

274
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:32,916
- The bonds are too stable.
- Lawrence...

275
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:40,090
This is what I'm gonna do.
I am gonna get a bank

276
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:42,468
to make me one.

277
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:44,762
And then

278
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:47,306
I'm gonna buy it.

279
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:50,476
I don't want that kind of business.

280
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,228
Money is not money. That's bad money.

281
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:56,106
Hey! Excuse me!

282
00:15:57,483 --> 00:16:00,402
Let me ask you this. What
company treats its customers

283
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:03,072
that shittily and succeeds?

284
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:05,783
Fine. Okay, Goldman. You're right.

285
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,201
<i>Mark Baum had built his career</i>

286
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:09,328
<i>on never assuming anyone
or any company</i>

287
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:11,080
<i>was legit without proving it.</i>

288
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:12,738
<i>When he was a kid
he excelled at studying</i>

289
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:14,792
<i>the Talmud in Yeshiva. Whatever.</i>

290
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,794
<i>But one day his rabbi told his mom why.</i>

291
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:20,964
Paul is a fine boy,
and Mark is an excellent student

292
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,675
of the Torah and the Talmud.

293
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,719
Then what's the problem, rabbi?

294
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:28,972
It's the reason Mark is studying so hard.

295
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:32,976
He's looking for inconsistencies
in the word of God!

296
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,898
So has he found any?

297
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:42,236
<i>Later, Baum started
his own fund on Wall Street.</i>

298
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:43,759
<i>He had an amazing nose for bullshit.</i>

299
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:45,896
<i>And he wasn't afraid to let
anyone know when and where</i>

300
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,534
<i>the bull had gone number two.</i>

301
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:50,244
<i>But then a tragedy happened to Mark,</i>

302
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:51,787
<i>and it turned his world view dark</i>

303
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,206
<i>and ready to believe
the whole system was a lie.</i>

304
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:55,833
Hold on.

305
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,752
It's Cynthia.
I'll be in the office in 20 minutes.

306
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,879
Hi, honey.

307
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:06,009
The therapist called. You did it again.

308
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:09,179
There were no cabs.
What was I supposed to do?

309
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:10,931
I worry about you, Mark.

310
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:12,349
<i>At least I went.</i>

311
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:15,602
You're running around like
you have to right

312
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,521
- every wrong in the world.
- Okay.

313
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:18,814
<i>You're so angry.</i>

314
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:20,315
Fine. You know what?

315
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:23,318
<i>I'm a mean guy and I'm pissed off.</i>

316
00:17:23,402 --> 00:17:25,320
But it is a shit storm out here, sweetie.

317
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:28,699
You have no idea
the kind of crap people are pulling.

318
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:31,493
And everyone's walking around
like they're in a goddamn Enya video.

319
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:34,682
They're all getting screwed, you know.

320
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:37,291
You know what they care about?
They care about the ballgame.

321
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:40,252
Or they care about
what actress just went into rehab.

322
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:42,379
I think you should try medication.

323
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:45,632
No, no. We agreed.
If it interfered with work.

324
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:47,551
You hate Wall Street.
Maybe it's time to quit.

325
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:50,012
- I love my job.
- You hate your job.

326
00:17:50,095 --> 00:17:52,139
- I love my job.
- You're miserable.

327
00:17:52,222 --> 00:17:54,224
I love my job. I love my job, honey.

328
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:56,477
Mark...

329
00:17:57,686 --> 00:18:00,772
I am sad every day
about what happened.

330
00:18:00,856 --> 00:18:04,193
<i>I know you must feel the same,
but you never show it.</i>

331
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:12,951
I know how close you were
to your brother.

332
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,414
<i>Paul.</i>

333
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,083
<i>Where'd you go, Paul?</i>

334
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:26,590
<i>Paul!</i>

335
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:35,015
Every day I think you're gonna
talk about it, but you never do.

336
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:42,648
Will you at least think about the idea
of making a change?

337
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:45,567
<i>Fine. Fine. Honey, you know what?
I will consider it.</i>

338
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:49,029
But, honestly, Cynthia.
I'm okay. I really am.

339
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:51,073
Hey, hey, hey! No, no.

340
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:54,535
My cab. That's my cab.
That's my cab. That is my cab.

341
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:56,203
<i>- Schmuck. Fuck you.
- Fuck you.</i>

342
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:57,955
<i>- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.</i>

343
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:00,457
I'll call you later.

344
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,927
I want to buy swaps
on mortgage bonds.

345
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,346
A credit default swap that will pay off

346
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:17,891
if the underlying bond fails.

347
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:20,300
You want to bet against
the housing market?

348
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,271
- Yes.
- Why?

349
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:23,522
Those bonds only fail

350
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:26,066
if millions of Americans
don't pay their mortgages.

351
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:28,569
That's never happened in history.

352
00:19:28,652 --> 00:19:31,572
If you'll excuse me, Dr. Burry,
it seems like a foolish investment.

353
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:34,408
Well, based on prevailing sentiment

354
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:36,535
of the market and banks
in popular culture,

355
00:19:36,618 --> 00:19:38,912
yes, it's a foolish investment.

356
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:41,498
But... everyone's wrong.

357
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,585
That's a good one.

358
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,589
This is Wall Street, Dr. Burry.

359
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:50,706
If you offer us free money,
we are going to take it.

360
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:55,345
My one concern is that
when the bonds fail,

361
00:19:56,471 --> 00:20:00,017
I want to be certain of payment

362
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,853
in case of solvency issues
with your bank.

363
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:06,231
I'm sorry, are you for real?

364
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:07,941
You wanna bet against
the housing market

365
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:09,433
and you're worried we won't pay you?

366
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:11,028
Yes, that's correct.

367
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:24,249
...unless the market crashes.

368
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:26,585
The market on housing's
never gonna crash

369
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:29,463
because it's so solid right now.

370
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:32,299
I mean, who doesn't pay
their mortgages?

371
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:40,557
Dr. Burry,

372
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:42,976
we could work out
a pay-as-we-go structure

373
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,062
that would pay out if the bonds fail.

374
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:46,705
But it would also apply
to your payments

375
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,690
if the value of the
mortgage bond goes up.

376
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:51,485
You'd have to pay us monthly premiums.

377
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:54,279
Is that acceptable, Dr. Burry?

378
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,075
Yes. Yes.

379
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:02,204
I have prospectuses
on six mortgage-backed

380
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:04,456
securities I want to short.

381
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,671
Majority of the mortgages...

382
00:21:21,973 --> 00:21:24,518
I don't see us losing
any money on these at all.

383
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:40,659
Dr. Burry, these should be fine.

384
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:42,661
Yeah. We're prepared
to sell you $5 million

385
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:44,624
in credit default swaps
on these mortgage bonds.

386
00:21:45,831 --> 00:21:47,249
Can we make it $100 million?

387
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:52,504
Absolutely, we can make it $100 million.

388
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:57,300
We'll be in touch,
send some paperwork over.

389
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:03,390
I like these cups.
Can I take one for my son?

390
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:05,225
Have... Yes. Yes.

391
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:06,810
Thank you.

392
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,270
Have two.

393
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:31,251
Is there any way to do $200 million?

394
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:35,338
I mean, we can. But are you sure?

395
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:39,426
Absolutely. Absolutely, we can do that.

396
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:56,526
We do different projects.
We do gardening.

397
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,320
The bonds I'd like to bet against.

398
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:01,646
It's not bad seeing yourself
on the big screen.

399
00:23:01,656 --> 00:23:02,657
It's very cool.

400
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,370
<i>I ordered the 24-ounce T-bone,
which was choice.</i>

401
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:08,914
<i>- I went for volume...
- Yeah.</i>

402
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:10,624
<i>...rather than prime.</i>

403
00:23:10,707 --> 00:23:13,376
I went for subprime, and the gist was...

404
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:23,011
<i>Can I have like, lettuce,
tomato, no onions?</i>

405
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:27,140
<i>So, no onions. Lettuce,
tomato, Thousand Island okay?</i>

406
00:23:27,224 --> 00:23:28,225
<i>Yeah.</i>

407
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:36,983
Hey, Randall! What's with the Dom?

408
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,944
Bonuses aren't for three months.

409
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:42,989
We just sold $200 million
in credit swaps for mortgage bonds.

410
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:45,242
Some fund manager from California.

411
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:46,701
It's fucking crazy, right?

412
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:47,943
A whole new way to make money, Doug.

413
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:50,205
Wait, wait. I didn't know
there were swaps on mortgages.

414
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:52,874
There are now.
We made it for him.

415
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,699
He must have gone off
his Zoloft or something.

416
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:56,044
I don't know.

417
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:57,921
- Want to join? No?
- Just a second.

418
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,549
Hey, Jared.

419
00:24:00,632 --> 00:24:02,165
Did you hear about the deal
that Randall just did

420
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:03,385
with some fund manager?

421
00:24:03,468 --> 00:24:05,262
Randall? Bullshit.

422
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,560
He's a foot soldier.
I'm sure it's a shit deal.

423
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:08,890
No, it's for real.

424
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,518
I told you we'd meet later.

425
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:14,094
Unfortunately, it's in a place
like this which I would never be.

426
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:16,773
I never hung out with
these idiots after work, ever.

427
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:18,650
I had fashion friends.

428
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:22,404
Apparently, this guy wanted $200 mil
in credit default swaps.

429
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:24,239
Randall made the sale.
Can you believe it?

430
00:24:24,322 --> 00:24:26,533
Somebody shorted $200 mil
on mortgage bonds?

431
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:30,036
That was just with Deutsche.
Word is he hit half the town.

432
00:24:30,912 --> 00:24:32,038
How much in total?

433
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:33,832
$1.3 billion.

434
00:24:33,915 --> 00:24:37,752
<i>What? That's pretty
much all of Salon's liquidity.</i>

435
00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:39,921
<i>Michael, this is highly distressing.</i>

436
00:24:40,005 --> 00:24:41,423
<i>Lawrence, that is not</i>

437
00:24:41,506 --> 00:24:44,050
all of our liquidity.

438
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:45,343
And I'm not certain

439
00:24:45,427 --> 00:24:47,637
<i>that you really understand this trade.</i>

440
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:48,805
This is a certainty.

441
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:51,975
<i>Mike, I consider myself a mentor to you.</i>

442
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:55,896
<i>But our company is not comfortable
with this investment. Am I being clear?</i>

443
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:58,231
Lawrence, I have full autonomy

444
00:24:58,315 --> 00:25:01,234
when it comes to investment strategy.

445
00:25:01,318 --> 00:25:02,444
You can read our agreement.

446
00:25:02,527 --> 00:25:05,864
<i>Do not throw our inception
agreement in my face, Michael.</i>

447
00:25:05,947 --> 00:25:07,032
<i>We had an underlying</i>

448
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:09,701
<i>understanding you wouldn't
act like a goddamn crazy man.</i>

449
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:11,369
This is not crazy.

450
00:25:11,453 --> 00:25:12,913
It's all very logical.

451
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:15,206
<i>So, now we pay up premiums
on these swaps</i>

452
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,543
against the housing market
until the mortgages fail?

453
00:25:18,627 --> 00:25:20,295
In other words, we lose millions

454
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,089
<i>until something that's
never happened before happens?</i>

455
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:27,969
That's correct.

456
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:02,754
Hello, Mark Baum.

457
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:04,923
Oh, hey, Kathy, you busted me.

458
00:26:05,006 --> 00:26:07,123
- I had a personal thing this afternoon.
- I'm not your babysitter.

459
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,761
If FrontPoint makes money
for Morgan Stanley, I'm happy.

460
00:26:09,844 --> 00:26:12,138
Okay. Hey, did I hear you're expecting?

461
00:26:12,222 --> 00:26:13,598
We're expecting to be expecting.

462
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:15,423
LVF's are cleaning us out
but we're staying positive...

463
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:16,935
That's exciting!

464
00:26:21,064 --> 00:26:24,067
...lump on my ball.
And I go in for a scan.

465
00:26:25,276 --> 00:26:28,989
Turns out that I have a very large thing
called an epididymis.

466
00:26:29,072 --> 00:26:31,616
Which is a thing
that goes around the ball

467
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,410
and is like a sac underneath.

468
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:34,536
I have an extremely

469
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:36,454
- pronounced epididymis.
- I'm riveted...

470
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:38,581
I'm riveted by this.
Do you have any pictures?

471
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:42,210
It's almost as large as
another testicle unto itself.

472
00:26:42,293 --> 00:26:44,379
So get this. Cynthia...

473
00:26:44,462 --> 00:26:48,717
Guys. Cynthia wants me to quit
and open a B&B in Vermont.

474
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,178
That sounds great. I'd love to see
Mark Baum run a Bed & Breakfast.

475
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:54,222
Like, "Here's your steel-cut
oatmeal, asshole."

476
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:56,891
<i>Mark refused to kiss the ring
of the people with the checkbooks,</i>

477
00:26:56,975 --> 00:27:00,103
<i>so he had to set up his fund
under Morgan Stanley's umbrella.</i>

478
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:03,815
<i>His small team reflected
his distrust of the system.</i>

479
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:05,316
You guys are sick. You're sick.

480
00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:07,569
She says this job
is making me unhappy.

481
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:08,768
But you're happy when you're unhappy.

482
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:10,280
I am happy when I'm unhappy.

483
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:11,364
<i>Vinnie Daniel.</i>

484
00:27:11,448 --> 00:27:12,647
You know how to make a muffin?

485
00:27:12,657 --> 00:27:14,417
<i>- Mark's numbers guy.
- Do you even know 'now</i>

486
00:27:14,451 --> 00:27:15,931
- to do laundry? Make a bed?
- Okay...

487
00:27:15,994 --> 00:27:18,621
<i>Vinnie lost his father to a violent crime
when he was young.</i>

488
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:20,540
<i>Just like Mark, he didn't talk about it.</i>

489
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:21,875
I don't talk about that.

490
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:24,367
Cynthia's no joke. She could actually
make him move to Vermont.

491
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:26,119
I mean, she made me
start wearing a seatbelt.

492
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:27,839
- Hey, you want me to...
- Porter Collins.

493
00:27:27,964 --> 00:27:30,133
<i>Former Olympic rower
who went to Brown.</i>

494
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:31,885
<i>He worked with Baum at a previous firm</i>

495
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,960
<i>and couldn't figure out
why no one listened to Baum.</i>

496
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,056
<i>The guy with all the good ideas.</i>

497
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:37,932
Sorry. I think you have
the wrong FrontPoint.

498
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:40,858
'Cause there is another FrontPoint
in this same building that is bonds.

499
00:27:40,894 --> 00:27:43,646
<i>And Danny Moses.
The optimist of the bunch.</i>

500
00:27:44,564 --> 00:27:45,774
<i>And a hell of a trader.</i>

501
00:27:45,857 --> 00:27:48,985
<i>Which is the only reason they put up
with his bullshit optimism.</i>

502
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:50,320
That was a weird call.

503
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:53,698
You take longer with a wrong number
than anybody else.

504
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:56,409
It was this guy from Deutsche

505
00:27:56,493 --> 00:27:59,079
who was talking about
shorting housing bonds.

506
00:28:00,455 --> 00:28:02,989
And then in the middle of the call
I realized he had the wrong FrontPoint.

507
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:05,335
And then... 'Cause he wanted
the one on the 8th floor.

508
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:07,921
He wanted to short housing bonds?

509
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:09,120
That happens like five times a day

510
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,663
that somebody gets
the wrong FrontPoint.

511
00:28:10,673 --> 00:28:12,842
- We should change our name.
- Wait. Wait.

512
00:28:12,926 --> 00:28:14,886
He wanted to short housing bonds?

513
00:28:15,178 --> 00:28:16,971
Who bets against housing?

514
00:28:17,931 --> 00:28:20,433
- What's the ABX at?
- What's ABX?

515
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:23,353
It tracks subprime mortgage
bond value. Go back to sleep.

516
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,064
The ABX is at...

517
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:29,442
Wow, it's down! It's down
three points since last year.

518
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:31,778
That's weird. I haven't heard
a peep about that.

519
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:32,904
What was this guy's name?

520
00:28:32,987 --> 00:28:35,115
Jared Vennett. Vennett.

521
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:37,450
<i>That's right.
These lucky sons of bitches</i>

522
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:40,286
<i>caught wind of one of the best trades
in Wall Street history</i>

523
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,955
<i>from a wrong number.</i>

524
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:44,290
<i>They should have paid 10%
to my fuckstick assistant.</i>

525
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:46,709
His name was Jared Vennett. Vennett.

526
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:48,701
Jared Vennett from Deutsche.
Sounded very sketchy.

527
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:49,712
Sounds like a douchebag.

528
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:52,340
Do you smell that?

529
00:28:52,423 --> 00:28:53,758
Do you smell that?

530
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:55,135
I smell money.

531
00:28:55,927 --> 00:28:57,345
This is your basic mortgage...

532
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:03,309
Okay, hi. How are you?

533
00:29:03,852 --> 00:29:05,061
Have a seat.

534
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:07,897
Okay, Mr. Vennett from Deutsche Bank.
What do we have?

535
00:29:12,443 --> 00:29:14,028
There you go.

536
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,034
So, how many people have you talked to
about this trade?

537
00:29:20,118 --> 00:29:22,871
A few. There's definitely some interest.

538
00:29:22,954 --> 00:29:24,372
- No!
- My boss would have my ass...

539
00:29:24,455 --> 00:29:25,874
- N.O.!
- You crazy, Jared?

540
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:27,500
- Get lost.
- Fuck you.

541
00:29:28,251 --> 00:29:31,045
Which is why you're here talking
to us, a wrong number.

542
00:29:31,129 --> 00:29:32,620
Sounds like there's a lot of interest.

543
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,966
All right. A few people have invited us in

544
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:37,427
just to laugh at me on this deal.
Is that you?

545
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,511
Is that what this is?

546
00:29:38,595 --> 00:29:39,637
That's not what this is.

547
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:41,514
That's just how Mark is.

548
00:29:41,598 --> 00:29:42,964
- Let's see what you got.
- I'm sorry.

549
00:29:42,974 --> 00:29:44,642
You smell that? What is that?

550
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,186
- What?
- What's that smell?

551
00:29:46,603 --> 00:29:48,646
- Your cologne?
- No.

552
00:29:50,982 --> 00:29:53,693
- Opportunity.
- No. Money.

553
00:29:53,776 --> 00:29:55,069
Okay.

554
00:29:55,153 --> 00:29:56,696
- I smell money.
- Okay.

555
00:29:57,197 --> 00:29:59,866
- Chris, God damn it.
- Sorry.

556
00:30:03,077 --> 00:30:05,496
This is your basic mortgage bond.

557
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,832
All right? The originals were simple.

558
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:11,586
They were just thousands
of AAA mortgages bundled together,

559
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:13,421
guaranteed by the U.S. government.

560
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,340
The modern ones are different.

561
00:30:15,423 --> 00:30:18,343
They're private. And they're
made up of layers of tranches.

562
00:30:23,598 --> 00:30:26,017
The highest level, AAA,
is getting paid first.

563
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,780
The lowest rated, B, is getting paid last,

564
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,270
taking on defaults first.

565
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:32,023
Now, obviously, if you're buying B's,
you could make more money.

566
00:30:32,106 --> 00:30:33,274
But they're a little risky.

567
00:30:33,358 --> 00:30:35,526
Sometimes they fail.

568
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:38,112
Chris?

569
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,202
Somewhere along the line,
these B's and BB's

570
00:30:44,285 --> 00:30:45,745
went from a little risky

571
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:48,248
to dog shit. Where's the trash?

572
00:30:48,331 --> 00:30:49,332
It's right behind you.

573
00:30:49,707 --> 00:30:52,585
I'm talking rock-bottom FICO scores.

574
00:30:53,795 --> 00:30:55,338
No income verification.

575
00:30:56,464 --> 00:30:59,300
Adjustable rates. Dog shit!

576
00:31:00,802 --> 00:31:03,638
The default rates are already
up from 1% to 4%, fellas.

577
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:05,932
And if they rise to 8%, and they will,

578
00:31:06,724 --> 00:31:08,977
a lot of these BBB's
are going to zero, too.

579
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,478
And that... You're too close.

580
00:31:12,313 --> 00:31:14,274
- ...is an opportunity.
- Okay.

581
00:31:14,357 --> 00:31:17,986
You're saying that at 8% the bonds fail
and we are already at 4%?

582
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:19,070
That's right.

583
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:20,947
If they go to 8%, it's Armageddon?

584
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,031
Yeah. That's right.

585
00:31:22,156 --> 00:31:23,866
How come nobody's talking about this?

586
00:31:23,992 --> 00:31:26,119
You're completely sure of the math?

587
00:31:26,202 --> 00:31:28,788
Look at him. That's my quant.

588
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:29,914
Your what?

589
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:31,791
My quantitative!

590
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:34,544
My math specialist. Look at him.

591
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:37,005
You notice anything different
about him? Look at his face.

592
00:31:37,088 --> 00:31:38,131
That's pretty racist.

593
00:31:38,214 --> 00:31:40,717
Look at his eyes! I'll give you a hint.

594
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,343
His name's Yang!

595
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:46,806
He won a national
math competition in China!

596
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:49,392
He doesn't even speak English!

597
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:51,144
Yeah, I'm sure of the math.

598
00:31:52,854 --> 00:31:56,649
Actually, my name's Jiang
and I do speak English.

599
00:31:56,733 --> 00:31:58,266
Jared likes to say I don't
because he thinks

600
00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:00,111
it makes me seem more authentic.

601
00:32:00,194 --> 00:32:02,739
And I got second in that
national math competition.

602
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:08,202
So you're offering us a chance to short
this pile of blocks? How?

603
00:32:08,286 --> 00:32:10,913
With something called
a credit default swap.

604
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,542
It's like insurance on the bond,
and if it goes bust

605
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:17,795
you can make 10-to-1,
even 20-to-1 return.

606
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:20,006
And it's already slowly going bust!

607
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:22,342
10-to-1? 20-to-1? No way.

608
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:24,385
And no one's paying attention.

609
00:32:24,886 --> 00:32:27,305
No one is paying attention!

610
00:32:27,388 --> 00:32:30,850
Because the banks are too busy
getting paid obscene fees

611
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:32,226
to sell these bonds.

612
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,063
But wait. You are the bank.
You work for the bank.

613
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:37,190
I bet your margins
are pretty nice and fat.

614
00:32:37,273 --> 00:32:39,567
Let's not talk about
my margins, by the way.

615
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,210
Being nice and fat, that's a nice shirt.
Do they make it for men?

616
00:32:43,071 --> 00:32:44,030
Aren't you the bank?

617
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:47,033
I work for the bank.
I don't think like a bank.

618
00:32:47,116 --> 00:32:50,995
Big bank, small bank,
I like to make money. All right?

619
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:53,790
Let me put it this way. I'm standing
in front of a burning house...

620
00:32:53,915 --> 00:32:56,667
And I'm offering you fire insurance on it.

621
00:32:56,751 --> 00:32:59,253
How can these underlying bonds
be as bad as you say?

622
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:00,588
It wouldn't be legal.

623
00:33:00,671 --> 00:33:02,632
Nobody knows what's in them.

624
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:04,217
Nobody knows what's in the bonds.

625
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,387
I've seen some that are 65% AAA-rated

626
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,431
that I know for a fact are filled with 95%

627
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:13,309
subprime shit with FICOs below 550!

628
00:33:13,768 --> 00:33:14,894
Get the fuck out of here.

629
00:33:14,977 --> 00:33:16,427
You want me to really blow your mind?

630
00:33:16,437 --> 00:33:18,054
When the market deems
a bond too risky to buy,

631
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:20,274
what do you think we do with it?

632
00:33:20,358 --> 00:33:22,985
- Take a guess.
- I don't know. You tell me.

633
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:26,989
All right. You think we just
warehouse it on the books? No.

634
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,991
We just repackage it
with a bunch of other shit

635
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:31,160
that didn't sell and put it into a CDO.

636
00:33:31,994 --> 00:33:33,996
- A CDO?
- Yes. A CDO.

637
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:36,656
- What is that?
- This is where we take a bunch of B's,

638
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,835
BB's and BBB's that haven't sold,

639
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:40,586
and we put them in a pile.

640
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,132
And when the pile gets large enough,

641
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:46,801
the whole thing is suddenly
considered diversified

642
00:33:46,884 --> 00:33:51,597
and the whores at the rating agency
give it a 92%-93% AAA rating,

643
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:53,683
no questions asked.

644
00:33:55,351 --> 00:33:57,854
Hold it. What? Say that again.

645
00:33:58,146 --> 00:34:00,398
A collateralized debt obligation.

646
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:02,056
It's important to understand
because it's what allowed

647
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:06,195
a housing crisis to become a
nationwide economic disaster.

648
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:09,490
Here's world-famous chef
Anthony Bourdain to explain.

649
00:34:14,036 --> 00:34:17,582
Okay, I'm a chef on a Sunday afternoon
setting the menu at a big restaurant.

650
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:19,125
I ordered my fish on Friday,

651
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,961
which is the mortgage bond
that Michael Burry shorted.

652
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,130
But some of the fresh fish doesn't sell.

653
00:34:24,213 --> 00:34:27,633
I don't know why. Maybe it just came out
halibut has the intelligence of a dolphin.

654
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:29,385
So, what am I going to do?

655
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:33,014
Throw all this unsold fish,
which is the BBB level of the bond,

656
00:34:33,097 --> 00:34:35,558
in the garbage and take the loss?

657
00:34:36,517 --> 00:34:37,477
No way.

658
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,979
Being the crafty
and morally onerous chef that I am,

659
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:42,773
whatever crappy levels
of the bond I don't sell,

660
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,817
I throw into a seafood stew.

661
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:48,362
See, it's not old fish.
It's a whole new thing!

662
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:52,158
And the best part is
they're eating 3-day-old halibut.

663
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:53,910
That is a CDO.

664
00:34:54,035 --> 00:34:56,871
I just need to know,
how could these possibly be collated?

665
00:34:56,954 --> 00:34:59,332
Somehow you're like Dora the Explorer

666
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:00,708
and you're the first person

667
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:02,200
- who found this thing.
- Hold on. Hold on.

668
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,086
So mortgage bonds are dog shit,

669
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,380
CDOs are dog shit
wrapped in cat shit.

670
00:35:07,882 --> 00:35:09,717
Yeah, that's right.

671
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,304
Institutions treat these CDOs
like they're as solid as treasury bonds,

672
00:35:13,387 --> 00:35:15,765
and they're going to zero.

673
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:18,059
No. That can't be right.
There were $500 billion

674
00:35:18,142 --> 00:35:20,478
in housing bonds sold last year alone.

675
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,397
The rating agencies, the banks,
the fucking government,

676
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:25,483
you're saying they're
all asleep at the wheel?

677
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:29,028
Yeah. My whole department's
long on this stuff.

678
00:35:29,904 --> 00:35:33,783
They call me Chicken Little.
They call me Bubble Boy.

679
00:35:36,452 --> 00:35:39,872
A's, zero. B's, zero.

680
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:43,417
BB's, zero. BBB's, zero.

681
00:35:45,836 --> 00:35:47,213
And then that happens.

682
00:35:47,296 --> 00:35:48,965
What is that?

683
00:35:50,841 --> 00:35:52,552
That's America's housing market.

684
00:35:55,513 --> 00:35:56,556
Thank you.

685
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,640
Fuckin' A, Jared.

686
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:59,725
Shut your fucking mouth.

687
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,978
- ...hang outwith you.
- Good. Okay.

688
00:36:02,103 --> 00:36:04,230
Sack up, do the deal. Let's be friends.

689
00:36:04,313 --> 00:36:05,523
We will see. Thank you.

690
00:36:05,606 --> 00:36:06,722
- Don't bullshit me.
- All right.

691
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:07,932
You're gonna say no, aren't you?

692
00:36:07,942 --> 00:36:10,403
No. No, I'm just evaluating right now.

693
00:36:10,486 --> 00:36:12,196
Thank you. Thank you for coming in.

694
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:14,615
Bye, Jared.

695
00:36:20,663 --> 00:36:22,081
I don't like it.

696
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,709
He's playing us.

697
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:27,743
He's playing us.
He's got too much skin in the game

698
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,422
and he's dumping his position.

699
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:31,882
What if he's right?

700
00:36:31,966 --> 00:36:35,011
- You want him to be right.
- Yes, I do.

701
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:38,347
The banks have given us
25% interest rates on credit cards.

702
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:41,976
They have screwed us on student loans
that we can never get out from under.

703
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:45,271
Then this guy walks into
my office and says

704
00:36:45,354 --> 00:36:48,316
those same banks got greedy,
they lost track of the market,

705
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:50,443
and I can profit off of their stupidity?

706
00:36:50,526 --> 00:36:52,778
Fuck, yeah, I want him to be right!

707
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:54,182
How come you don't hate this guy?

708
00:36:54,196 --> 00:36:55,876
He's everything
you taught us not to trust.

709
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:57,658
I can't hate him. He is so transparent

710
00:36:57,742 --> 00:37:00,119
in his self-interest
that I kind of respect him.

711
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:02,496
Would I buy a car from him? No.

712
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:04,864
Is he right about the mortgage market?

713
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:07,084
- No.
- Let's find out. Let's find out.

714
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:10,504
Look. It's two very simple questions.

715
00:37:10,588 --> 00:37:12,089
Is there a housing bubble?

716
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:14,759
And if there is,
how exposed are the banks?

717
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:15,885
Yeah. Okay.

718
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:17,386
Let's get on this quickly too.

719
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,846
Because if he's right,

720
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:22,391
every loser with a couple million bucks
and a fund is gonna be jumping on this.

721
00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:23,934
Let's go.

722
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:27,730
Just that morning...

723
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:35,237
JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase.

724
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:39,367
Okay. Stop saying "JPMorgan Chase".

725
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,868
I got a good feeling about this.

726
00:37:40,951 --> 00:37:42,431
It's just a meeting though, you know?

727
00:37:42,745 --> 00:37:44,664
It's just a meeting. It's something like...

728
00:37:44,747 --> 00:37:46,874
People have meetings
all the time. You know?

729
00:37:46,957 --> 00:37:48,658
People drink their coffee,
they have a meeting.

730
00:37:48,668 --> 00:37:50,002
- Brownfield Fund?
- Yes!

731
00:37:50,086 --> 00:37:51,962
- Hey. Hello.
- Ted.

732
00:37:52,046 --> 00:37:54,840
- Chris. I'm on Ted's desk.
- Chris. Okay.

733
00:37:54,924 --> 00:37:56,165
- I'm Charlie, Charlie Geller.
- Charlie.

734
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:57,802
- Jamie Shipley. Hi.
- Jamie.

735
00:37:57,885 --> 00:38:00,846
We're so excited to get set
up on your trading platform.

736
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,056
Cool.

737
00:38:02,139 --> 00:38:03,933
Here, have a seat a second.

738
00:38:04,684 --> 00:38:05,685
All right.

739
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:09,689
So, I... Ted had asked me
to do some meeting prep.

740
00:38:09,772 --> 00:38:13,150
But I couldn't find any
marketing material on you guys.

741
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:15,069
We just moved here from Boulder.

742
00:38:15,152 --> 00:38:16,654
- Yeah.
- Got it.

743
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:19,115
Could we see some
of your offering documents?

744
00:38:19,198 --> 00:38:21,701
Well, Brownfield is its own money.

745
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:23,994
- It's our money.
- Yeah.

746
00:38:24,078 --> 00:38:25,871
Can you tell us how much you manage?

747
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:29,417
Of course. We're doing
$30 million right now.

748
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,710
But we started

749
00:38:30,793 --> 00:38:33,546
- four years ago with $110,000.
- Wow.

750
00:38:33,629 --> 00:38:38,259
So, as you can see,
that's pretty phenomenal returns.

751
00:38:38,342 --> 00:38:41,554
We want to get an ISDA agreement
with JPMorgan so we can

752
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:44,181
deal in long-term options.

753
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:45,599
- That's really cool.
- Yeah.

754
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:00,281
That is so cool.

755
00:39:00,364 --> 00:39:01,449
Thank you.

756
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:05,703
But you guys are under
the capital requirements for an ISDA.

757
00:39:05,828 --> 00:39:06,829
By how much?

758
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:12,084
One billion four hundred
seventy million, so...

759
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:14,628
...a lot.

760
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,339
This makes us look bad, doesn't it,

761
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:20,634
that we didn't know
what the capital requirements were?

762
00:39:22,261 --> 00:39:23,679
It's not great.

763
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,473
But

764
00:39:25,556 --> 00:39:28,017
keep up those returns and give us a call

765
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,894
way down the line. You know.

766
00:39:29,977 --> 00:39:30,978
Okay?

767
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:32,354
- Okay.
- Thanks, Chris.

768
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,482
- Have a good one, guys.
- Thank you, Chris.

769
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:39,862
Shit!

770
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,310
Who the fuck schedules a meeting

771
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:44,492
- at 4:50 in the afternoon?
- Oh, my, God.

772
00:39:44,575 --> 00:39:46,327
That was so painful.

773
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:50,039
Dude, B of A and Bear
didn't even return our calls.

774
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:52,291
And even fucking Wachovia

775
00:39:52,374 --> 00:39:54,043
- blew us off, man!
- I know.

776
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,462
Here's the prospectuses
of all the other losers

777
00:39:56,545 --> 00:39:58,255
who didn't make it past the lobby.

778
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:00,216
I don't think I can do
this anymore. You know.

779
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:03,135
I'm young, yet.
I can still do something with my life.

780
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:05,304
I miss Colorado anyway.
The weed's better.

781
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:08,265
Gentlemen, I need you to leave.

782
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,767
Yep, yep, we're going. Let's go.

783
00:40:09,892 --> 00:40:11,018
Look at this. Look at this.

784
00:40:11,101 --> 00:40:12,436
This guy

785
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,439
says that the housing market's
a giant bubble.

786
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:19,985
Okay, so this part
isn't totally accurate, you know.

787
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:22,154
We didn't find Jared Vennett's
housing bubble pitch

788
00:40:22,238 --> 00:40:24,156
in the lobby of a bank that rejected us.

789
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,699
The truth is

790
00:40:25,783 --> 00:40:28,661
a friend had told Charlie about it,
and I read about it

791
00:40:28,744 --> 00:40:30,162
in Grant's Interest Rate Observer.

792
00:40:30,246 --> 00:40:31,580
This is crazy.

793
00:40:31,664 --> 00:40:34,166
This is crazy stuff.

794
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,919
Shit, he's saying that there's
10-to-1 returns

795
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:40,631
on credit default swaps
for mortgage-backed securities?

796
00:40:40,756 --> 00:40:43,384
And the whole housing market
is about to collapse?

797
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:45,845
<i>For Jamie and Charlie,
the housing market</i>

798
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:48,389
<i>doomsday prediction
was music to their ears.</i>

799
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,940
<i>They had started working
out of Jamie's garage</i>

800
00:40:58,023 --> 00:40:59,942
<i>with $110,000 Jamie had saved</i>

801
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:02,111
<i>taking sailboats up and down
the East Coast.</i>

802
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:05,823
Our investment strategy was simple.

803
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:07,950
People hate to think about
bad things happening,

804
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:10,369
so they always underestimate
their likelihood.

805
00:41:10,452 --> 00:41:12,955
<i>Their strategy was simple and brilliant.</i>

806
00:41:13,497 --> 00:41:14,582
What he said.

807
00:41:14,665 --> 00:41:17,376
<i>Jamie and Charlie found markets
will sell options very cheaply</i>

808
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:19,670
<i>on things they think will never happen.</i>

809
00:41:19,753 --> 00:41:21,412
<i>So when they were wrong,
they were wrong small,</i>

810
00:41:21,422 --> 00:41:23,382
<i>but when they were right,
they were right big.</i>

811
00:41:30,222 --> 00:41:33,976
<i>Within a few years they had turned
$110,000 into $30 million.</i>

812
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,779
<i>But then it was time
to go to New York City.</i>

813
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:38,439
<i>And so far, it wasn't going very well.</i>

814
00:41:38,522 --> 00:41:40,274
So what if it does
seem interesting. No...

815
00:41:40,357 --> 00:41:43,861
No bank will give us our ISDA.
We're dead in the water.

816
00:41:45,362 --> 00:41:47,781
These kind of trades
are totally out of the question.

817
00:41:47,865 --> 00:41:49,491
We got to call Ben.

818
00:41:51,702 --> 00:41:53,203
Let's call Ben!

819
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,165
<i>Ben Rickert was
a former trader in Singapore</i>

820
00:41:56,248 --> 00:41:59,001
<i>for Chase who quit
the whole game in disgust.</i>

821
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:01,484
<i>He happened to be Jamie's neighbor
when they were in Colorado</i>

822
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:03,672
<i>and they met walking dogs.</i>

823
00:42:03,756 --> 00:42:05,215
<i>But Ben was dark.</i>

824
00:42:05,341 --> 00:42:07,384
<i>He didn't just think
the whole system would fail.</i>

825
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:09,678
<i>He thought the whole world
was going down.</i>

826
00:42:11,722 --> 00:42:13,842
Every one of these vegetables
is fresh from my garden.

827
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,676
You guys should start your own garden.

828
00:42:17,686 --> 00:42:21,148
What you got to do is get your
soil off the petrochemicals.

829
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:23,442
I used wood ash and urine
to help restore the soil.

830
00:42:23,525 --> 00:42:25,110
It creates ammonium nitrate.

831
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:26,946
Seeds are gonna be the new currency.

832
00:42:27,071 --> 00:42:29,073
And not those Franken-seeds
from Monsanto.

833
00:42:29,156 --> 00:42:31,742
I'm talking about good,
healthy, organic seeds.

834
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:32,952
Make yourself a garden.

835
00:42:33,035 --> 00:42:34,568
- Learn to live off the land.
- You're a fucking lunatic.

836
00:42:34,578 --> 00:42:36,789
<i>Ben had real experience in a big bank.</i>

837
00:42:36,872 --> 00:42:40,542
<i>Jamie and Charlie had never even been
in a Manhattan bank bathroom.</i>

838
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:42,336
<i>But Ben was done
with the banking world.</i>

839
00:42:42,419 --> 00:42:43,754
<i>He was very clear.</i>

840
00:42:43,837 --> 00:42:45,422
<i>All right, let's crunch some numbers</i>

841
00:42:45,506 --> 00:42:47,883
<i>and then maybe
we'll talk about calling Ben.</i>

842
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:49,083
We're always crunching numbers.

843
00:42:49,093 --> 00:42:50,209
When haven't we crunched
the numbers?

844
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:51,377
We're gonna crunch
the numbers like harder...

845
00:42:51,387 --> 00:42:52,346
I need you out of here.

846
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:54,429
- Of course. One second.
- Yes, ma'am. We're going.

847
00:42:57,434 --> 00:42:59,728
Oh, God. I hate this.
This is a total waste of time.

848
00:42:59,937 --> 00:43:02,272
Oh, come on. Would you relax?

849
00:43:03,023 --> 00:43:06,151
There's a housing development
45 minutes outside town.

850
00:43:06,235 --> 00:43:08,112
Mark wants us to check that out first.

851
00:43:08,195 --> 00:43:10,270
Well, I hope there are some
Cuban restaurants on the way there.

852
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,908
Because I heard the Cuban food
is amazing in Miami.

853
00:43:12,992 --> 00:43:15,703
Please don't be chipper in the
face of me being miserable.

854
00:43:15,786 --> 00:43:17,454
It really makes me hate you.

855
00:43:17,538 --> 00:43:20,082
How is wanting to eat
good food being chipper?

856
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:22,960
Hello?

857
00:43:24,378 --> 00:43:25,629
Hello?

858
00:43:26,422 --> 00:43:27,756
What do these go for?

859
00:43:29,425 --> 00:43:31,135
$425,000 each?

860
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,575
What's up, man? What do you want?

861
00:43:54,658 --> 00:43:57,995
Hello. I'm surveying mortgage owners
who are over 90 days delinquent.

862
00:43:58,078 --> 00:44:00,622
I'm looking for a Harvey Humpsey.

863
00:44:00,706 --> 00:44:01,874
You want my landlord's dog?

864
00:44:04,043 --> 00:44:05,576
Your landlord filled out
his mortgage application

865
00:44:05,586 --> 00:44:08,047
using his dog's name?

866
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:09,590
I guess so.

867
00:44:09,673 --> 00:44:12,176
Wait, has that asshole
not been paying his mortgage?

868
00:44:12,259 --> 00:44:13,594
'Cause I've been paying my rent.

869
00:44:13,677 --> 00:44:15,596
Well, yeah, he is over
90 days delinquent.

870
00:44:15,971 --> 00:44:17,556
Seriously, man,

871
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:19,475
am I gonna have to leave?

872
00:44:21,977 --> 00:44:24,354
'Cause my kid just got
settled in school, man.

873
00:44:24,438 --> 00:44:26,607
Hey. How are ya?

874
00:44:27,274 --> 00:44:29,777
- My name's Ken.
- You're Ken?

875
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,653
You should talk to your landlord
about that.

876
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:33,312
I'm sorry, I don't have
any more information.

877
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:34,698
But you...

878
00:44:35,365 --> 00:44:36,950
You have a great day. See ya, Ken.

879
00:44:37,034 --> 00:44:38,452
There's books everywhere!

880
00:44:38,535 --> 00:44:40,788
Books everywhere?

881
00:44:40,871 --> 00:44:44,124
Seriously, man,
is everything gonna be okay?

882
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:47,294
You should... You should call him.

883
00:44:47,377 --> 00:44:48,457
You should give him a call.

884
00:44:48,504 --> 00:44:50,224
It's not my fault, dude.
I've been paying...

885
00:44:54,051 --> 00:44:55,135
Hello!

886
00:44:59,056 --> 00:45:01,183
Looks like the <i>Mary Celeste</i>.

887
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:04,019
Look. All they took was the TV.

888
00:45:04,812 --> 00:45:06,772
It's weird.

889
00:45:06,855 --> 00:45:09,191
They didn't even clean out the cat litter.

890
00:45:17,741 --> 00:45:18,784
Oh, God.

891
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,339
It's like Chernobyl.

892
00:45:32,422 --> 00:45:35,843
There's like a hundred houses.
There can't be four people living here.

893
00:45:37,886 --> 00:45:40,055
- Oh, fuck that!
- Shit!

894
00:45:54,945 --> 00:45:57,990
He's been in there for seven hours.
Where does he go to the bathroom?

895
00:45:58,073 --> 00:45:59,491
I heard he had a breakdown.

896
00:45:59,575 --> 00:46:01,535
He's letting the fund tank.

897
00:46:01,618 --> 00:46:03,078
My buddy in Manhattan said...

898
00:46:03,203 --> 00:46:04,746
Dr. Burry's office.

899
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,760
No, he actually prefers
that you email him.

900
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:08,083
Excuse me.

901
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:09,418
Mr. Fields, Mr...

902
00:46:13,547 --> 00:46:15,299
- Hi, Lawrence.
- Holy shit!

903
00:46:16,925 --> 00:46:20,470
We have no confidence
in your ability to identify

904
00:46:20,554 --> 00:46:23,557
macroeconomic trends.

905
00:46:24,474 --> 00:46:27,019
You flew here to tell me that? Why?

906
00:46:27,102 --> 00:46:30,522
Anyone can see that
there is a real estate bubble.

907
00:46:30,606 --> 00:46:32,441
Actually, no one can see a bubble.

908
00:46:32,524 --> 00:46:33,734
That's what makes it a bubble.

909
00:46:33,817 --> 00:46:36,111
That's dumb, Lawrence.

910
00:46:36,195 --> 00:46:37,779
There's always markers.

911
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,991
Mortgage fraud has

912
00:46:41,074 --> 00:46:42,826
quintupled since 2000

913
00:46:42,951 --> 00:46:45,787
and the average take-home pay is flat,

914
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:47,331
but home prices are soaring.

915
00:46:47,414 --> 00:46:49,499
That means the homes
are debt, not assets.

916
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,793
So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who

917
00:46:52,794 --> 00:46:56,173
gets his hair cut at Supercuts
and doesn't wear shoes,

918
00:46:56,298 --> 00:46:59,134
knows more than Alan Greenspan
and Hank Paulson.

919
00:46:59,301 --> 00:47:00,302
Well...

920
00:47:01,011 --> 00:47:03,639
Dr. Mike Burry, yes, he does.

921
00:47:04,848 --> 00:47:06,642
That's cute. That's cute.

922
00:47:06,725 --> 00:47:09,061
Are you being sarcastic with us, Mike?

923
00:47:12,189 --> 00:47:13,607
Lawrence,

924
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:16,193
I don't know how to be sarcastic.

925
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,655
I don't know how to be funny.
I don't know how to

926
00:47:20,322 --> 00:47:21,782
work people.

927
00:47:21,865 --> 00:47:23,033
I...

928
00:47:23,116 --> 00:47:25,452
I just know how to read numbers.

929
00:47:25,535 --> 00:47:28,038
How big is your short position
right now?

930
00:47:29,539 --> 00:47:31,124
Just $1.3 billion.

931
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:34,544
- And the premiums?
- Well, we pay

932
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:38,340
roughly $80 to 90 million

933
00:47:38,465 --> 00:47:39,925
each year, which is high,

934
00:47:40,008 --> 00:47:42,094
but I was the first to do this trade.

935
00:47:42,177 --> 00:47:45,639
Watch. It will pay. I may have
been early, but I'm not wrong.

936
00:47:45,722 --> 00:47:48,058
It's the same thing.
It's the same thing, Mike!

937
00:47:48,892 --> 00:47:53,021
You're managing a fund of,
what, $555 million?

938
00:47:53,563 --> 00:47:57,067
In six years, it'll all be gone.

939
00:47:57,859 --> 00:47:59,278
On one bet.

940
00:47:59,361 --> 00:48:02,531
No, the second quarter of '07
is when the adjustable rates kick in.

941
00:48:02,656 --> 00:48:04,157
The defaults will skyrocket.

942
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:05,951
Yeah. Says you.

943
00:48:06,034 --> 00:48:08,495
How much is eligible
for withdrawal before they do?

944
00:48:08,578 --> 00:48:10,497
Say, in the next two quarters.

945
00:48:11,206 --> 00:48:13,208
If your investors panic.

946
00:48:16,753 --> 00:48:18,880
- $302 million?
- I...

947
00:48:19,756 --> 00:48:21,383
My God, Mike.

948
00:48:26,221 --> 00:48:28,140
No one will pull out.
That would be suicide.

949
00:48:28,223 --> 00:48:30,642
I mean, I'm down 17% for the year.

950
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:33,061
But if they trust me,
and they trust me, because...

951
00:48:33,145 --> 00:48:35,772
No one trusts you! No one!

952
00:48:35,856 --> 00:48:38,275
I sent several emails to my investors

953
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,444
letting them know that the...

954
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:47,075
...the second quarter of '07 is when our
housing positions show returns and...

955
00:48:48,452 --> 00:48:49,703
I've been very clear.

956
00:48:50,495 --> 00:48:53,332
People will withdraw their money.

957
00:48:53,915 --> 00:48:57,377
Lawrence, that would be so stupid.
I mean, the...

958
00:48:57,461 --> 00:49:00,964
If the fund's capitals drop too much,

959
00:49:01,423 --> 00:49:04,509
then the swaps contracts are voided.

960
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:07,846
And then the banks get to keep
all of the collateral.

961
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:10,140
- Wait a minute. Wait.
- All of it.

962
00:49:10,265 --> 00:49:12,392
The contracts are voided?

963
00:49:12,476 --> 00:49:14,269
The contracts are voided?

964
00:49:14,978 --> 00:49:16,646
Holy shit!

965
00:49:17,105 --> 00:49:18,106
Oh, motherfucker!

966
00:49:18,774 --> 00:49:20,275
Michael?

967
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,319
Give me my money back.

968
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:29,117
Michael, do you hear me?
I want my money back.

969
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,955
Give me my fucking money back...

970
00:49:34,998 --> 00:49:36,416
...you motherfucker.

971
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:40,462
The market's in an itsy-bitsy
little gully right now.

972
00:49:40,587 --> 00:49:42,839
It's like everybody said,
"Okay, that was crazy."

973
00:49:42,923 --> 00:49:44,800
"Let's just all calm down."

974
00:49:46,635 --> 00:49:49,846
I sold that house for $350,000
the year it was built.

975
00:49:50,514 --> 00:49:52,682
Two years later, $480,000.

976
00:49:52,808 --> 00:49:55,977
Then $585,000 maybe 18 months ago.

977
00:49:56,103 --> 00:49:58,647
This couple bought it
for $650,000 last year.

978
00:49:59,147 --> 00:50:00,982
He'd let it go for that.

979
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:02,734
Hi, John.

980
00:50:02,818 --> 00:50:03,860
No, no, no.

981
00:50:04,486 --> 00:50:05,977
It will break his heart, but he'll let it go.

982
00:50:05,987 --> 00:50:07,739
Why is he selling?

983
00:50:07,823 --> 00:50:09,658
Neither one's working right now.

984
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:13,286
Marlene, you'd say
they're motivated, right?

985
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:16,373
As motivated as one can be
in this neighborhood.

986
00:50:16,456 --> 00:50:19,000
This house on the left, I would say
they're probably motivated.

987
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:21,044
Wow, a lot of people
seem very motivated.

988
00:50:21,128 --> 00:50:22,212
Oh, it's just the gully.

989
00:50:22,504 --> 00:50:24,256
That's all. Just...

990
00:50:24,339 --> 00:50:25,757
Just nerves.

991
00:50:25,841 --> 00:50:27,551
So where do we stand?

992
00:50:28,718 --> 00:50:31,221
I need to talk to my wife.

993
00:50:31,304 --> 00:50:32,597
This market won't last.

994
00:50:32,681 --> 00:50:34,474
Actually, could I talk
to a mortgage broker?

995
00:50:34,558 --> 00:50:36,393
Anybody you recommend?
Anybody you like.

996
00:50:36,476 --> 00:50:38,478
Yes, yes, I have someone. Absolutely.

997
00:50:38,562 --> 00:50:39,813
Yeah, bitch better like me.

998
00:50:39,896 --> 00:50:41,148
Sent her ass to Cabo.

999
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:45,360
So is Morgan Stanley
recruiting us? Is that it?

1000
00:50:45,652 --> 00:50:48,613
Oh, no. No.
The bank owns our hedge fund,

1001
00:50:48,697 --> 00:50:49,855
but we're not really part of it.

1002
00:50:49,865 --> 00:50:52,325
We invest in financial
service companies

1003
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:55,370
and we're trying to understand
the residential mortgage business.

1004
00:50:55,454 --> 00:50:58,373
How many loans
do you write each month?

1005
00:50:58,498 --> 00:51:00,041
- About 60.
- Yeah.

1006
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:01,585
What was it four years ago?

1007
00:51:02,544 --> 00:51:03,879
Ten...

1008
00:51:03,962 --> 00:51:05,213
Maybe 15.

1009
00:51:05,297 --> 00:51:07,591
Yeah, I was a bartender.
Now I own a boat.

1010
00:51:07,674 --> 00:51:08,633
You own a...

1011
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:11,970
So how many of these are
adjustable-rate mortgages?

1012
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:13,722
- Well, most.
- Oh, yeah.

1013
00:51:13,805 --> 00:51:15,765
Yeah, I'd say about 90%.

1014
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:18,977
The bonuses on those
skyrocketed a few years ago.

1015
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,380
Adjustable's our bread and honey.

1016
00:51:20,437 --> 00:51:22,981
So do applicants ever get rejected?

1017
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:28,528
Seriously?

1018
00:51:29,404 --> 00:51:31,490
Look, if they get rejected,
I suck at my job.

1019
00:51:31,573 --> 00:51:33,074
Even if they have no money?

1020
00:51:33,158 --> 00:51:36,036
Well, my firm offers NINJA loans.

1021
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:38,580
- Okay.
- "No Income, No Job."

1022
00:51:38,914 --> 00:51:41,124
I just leave the income section blank
if I want.

1023
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:42,459
Corporate doesn't care.

1024
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:45,837
These people just want homes.
And they go with the flow.

1025
00:51:45,921 --> 00:51:47,964
- Good for you.
- Your companies don't verify?

1026
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,762
If I write a loan on Friday afternoon,

1027
00:51:54,638 --> 00:51:56,640
a big bank will buy it by Monday lunch.

1028
00:51:57,182 --> 00:51:58,517
Yeah. Same here.

1029
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:03,188
- Could you hold on a second?
- Yeah.

1030
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,530
I don't get it. Why are they confessing?

1031
00:52:11,613 --> 00:52:13,573
They're not confessing.

1032
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:15,367
They're bragging.

1033
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:28,129
Do people have any idea
what they are buying?

1034
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:31,341
I focus on the immigrants, you know.

1035
00:52:31,424 --> 00:52:32,916
Once they find out
they're getting a home,

1036
00:52:32,926 --> 00:52:34,511
they sign where you tell them to sign.

1037
00:52:34,594 --> 00:52:36,721
Don't ask questions.
Don't understand the rates.

1038
00:52:36,805 --> 00:52:38,265
- Fucking idiots.
- Yeah.

1039
00:52:38,348 --> 00:52:39,766
And you target immigrants, too?

1040
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:42,686
Well, their credit actually
isn't bad enough for him.

1041
00:52:44,604 --> 00:52:46,273
Look, I'm a yield guy.

1042
00:52:46,773 --> 00:52:47,816
Okay...

1043
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,320
I make $2,000 on a fixed-rate
prime loan, right?

1044
00:52:52,404 --> 00:52:56,032
But I can make $10,000
on a subprime adjustable.

1045
00:52:56,116 --> 00:52:59,077
Trust me, I'm not driving
a 7 Series without strippers.

1046
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,455
No one on the pole has good credit
and they're all cash rich.

1047
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:04,874
I think I read Warren Buffett
say something like that.

1048
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:07,627
What? Who's Warren Buffett?

1049
00:53:08,169 --> 00:53:10,880
Okay, so strippers. Like exotic dancers?

1050
00:53:10,964 --> 00:53:12,173
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1051
00:53:12,257 --> 00:53:14,217
Nude, you know, topless.

1052
00:53:14,301 --> 00:53:16,136
- Strippers.
- Yeah.

1053
00:53:19,723 --> 00:53:20,932
Can you introduce us?

1054
00:53:21,016 --> 00:53:23,476
Yes! Yes.

1055
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,440
I always get option-pay adjustables.
I'm a private contractor.

1056
00:53:28,523 --> 00:53:30,191
What? I can't hear you. I'm sorry.

1057
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:32,110
I always get option-pay adjustables.

1058
00:53:32,193 --> 00:53:34,446
I'm a private contractor.
I need flexibility.

1059
00:53:34,529 --> 00:53:37,115
And you tell the mortgage
company what you do?

1060
00:53:37,198 --> 00:53:39,200
I write "therapist".

1061
00:53:39,284 --> 00:53:40,744
- You can touch me.
- Always?

1062
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:42,412
Only in V.I.P.

1063
00:53:42,495 --> 00:53:45,123
No, no, no, you say
you always do adjustables.

1064
00:53:45,206 --> 00:53:47,006
And you have more than
one loan on a property?

1065
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:49,294
Everybody does. At least down here.

1066
00:53:49,377 --> 00:53:50,378
I'm sorry, what?

1067
00:53:50,462 --> 00:53:53,048
Everybody does. At least down here.

1068
00:53:53,131 --> 00:53:55,300
That way you only put down, like, 5%.

1069
00:53:55,383 --> 00:53:57,177
Prices have leveled off, though, right?

1070
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,095
Yeah. There's a gully.

1071
00:53:59,179 --> 00:54:02,891
Would you mind not moving anymore?
I'll still pay you.

1072
00:54:06,686 --> 00:54:09,397
Sorry. We're not alone.

1073
00:54:09,481 --> 00:54:12,108
Okay, look. If home prices don't go up,

1074
00:54:12,192 --> 00:54:14,486
you are not going to be able
to refinance.

1075
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:17,697
And you'll be stuck paying
whatever your monthly payment is

1076
00:54:17,781 --> 00:54:20,492
once it jumps up
after your teaser rate expires.

1077
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:22,952
Your monthlies
could go up 200%-300%.

1078
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:25,413
James says I can always refinance.

1079
00:54:25,497 --> 00:54:27,290
Well, he's a liar.

1080
00:54:27,374 --> 00:54:30,502
Actually, in this particular case,
James probably is wrong.

1081
00:54:30,585 --> 00:54:33,880
200 percent? On all my loans?

1082
00:54:33,963 --> 00:54:35,340
What do you mean "all" your loans?

1083
00:54:35,423 --> 00:54:37,842
We're talking about two loans
on one house, right?

1084
00:54:38,677 --> 00:54:40,637
I have five houses.

1085
00:54:40,762 --> 00:54:42,722
And a condo.

1086
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:46,101
Hey, there's a bubble.

1087
00:54:46,184 --> 00:54:47,185
<i>How do you know?</i>

1088
00:54:47,268 --> 00:54:50,689
Trust me. Call Vennett,
buy $50 million in swaps on the MBS.

1089
00:54:50,772 --> 00:54:53,692
What do we got? Garibaldi IV, BBB.

1090
00:54:53,775 --> 00:54:55,276
Mark, are you sure?

1091
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,195
Yeah. Yeah, it's time to call bullshit.

1092
00:54:57,278 --> 00:54:59,948
- Bullshit on what?
- Every fucking thing.

1093
00:55:24,139 --> 00:55:25,807
FrontPoint! FrontPoint!

1094
00:55:27,642 --> 00:55:29,436
Is this America's angriest hedge fund?

1095
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:31,646
<i>All right, listen.
I got one last question for you.</i>

1096
00:55:32,814 --> 00:55:34,649
How are you fucking us?

1097
00:55:36,484 --> 00:55:38,084
There's a nicer way to say that, Vinnie.

1098
00:55:38,111 --> 00:55:39,654
I'm serious.

1099
00:55:39,738 --> 00:55:42,824
We'll buy your swaps, but only if you say
how you're fucking us.

1100
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:45,410
<i>I'm not fucking you, Vinnie.
I'm kissing you.</i>

1101
00:55:45,493 --> 00:55:48,246
I'm looking deep into your eyes
as I make love to you, Vinnie.

1102
00:55:48,329 --> 00:55:51,666
I'm handing you the deal of the century
on a fucking platter.

1103
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,127
<i>What do I get out of it? Easy.</i>

1104
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,629
I got a $20-million-a-month
negative carry.

1105
00:55:56,713 --> 00:55:58,153
I got bosses trying to pull the plug

1106
00:55:58,173 --> 00:56:00,592
because they think I'm out
of my fucking mind.

1107
00:56:00,675 --> 00:56:01,676
All right?

1108
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,844
We make this trade,

1109
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:05,263
those problems aren't so big anymore.

1110
00:56:05,346 --> 00:56:09,100
And sure, swaps are a dark market,
so I set the price.

1111
00:56:09,184 --> 00:56:10,685
Whatever price I want.

1112
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:12,187
And when you come for the payday,

1113
00:56:12,312 --> 00:56:14,522
I'm gonna rip your eyes out,
I'm gonna make a fortune.

1114
00:56:15,648 --> 00:56:17,223
<i>But the good news is, Vinnie,
you're not gonna care</i>

1115
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:19,444
<i>because you're gonna make
so much fucking money.</i>

1116
00:56:19,527 --> 00:56:20,820
<i>That's what I get out of it.</i>

1117
00:56:20,904 --> 00:56:22,270
<i>Want to know what you get out of it?</i>

1118
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,784
You get the ice cream, the hot fudge,
the banana, and the nuts.

1119
00:56:25,867 --> 00:56:27,619
Right now, I get
the sprinkles, and, yeah,

1120
00:56:27,702 --> 00:56:30,330
if this goes through, I get the cherry.

1121
00:56:30,413 --> 00:56:32,624
But you get the sundae, Vinnie.

1122
00:56:32,707 --> 00:56:34,375
<i>You get the sundae.</i>

1123
00:56:36,836 --> 00:56:39,631
All right, I buy that. Thank you.

1124
00:56:39,714 --> 00:56:41,883
<i>So what do you say?</i>

1125
00:56:41,966 --> 00:56:43,843
- You want me to make you a market?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1126
00:56:43,927 --> 00:56:47,430
We'll take $50 million,
Garibaldi IV, BBB.

1127
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:50,934
Sharpen your pencils.
I'll get the paperwork ready.

1128
00:56:53,645 --> 00:56:55,146
Fuck you, too.

1129
00:56:57,106 --> 00:56:58,608
Yes!

1130
00:57:00,568 --> 00:57:01,569
That's right.

1131
00:57:03,696 --> 00:57:05,615
Oh, man.

1132
00:57:05,698 --> 00:57:09,244
He has so many numbers,
and I always forget

1133
00:57:10,036 --> 00:57:11,736
which one he prefers,
because he's very specific.

1134
00:57:11,746 --> 00:57:12,956
Start with the first one.

1135
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:14,364
I don't know if it's the first one.

1136
00:57:14,374 --> 00:57:15,667
Just try it.

1137
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,293
Okay. I... Okay.

1138
00:57:34,936 --> 00:57:37,689
- Ben Rickert.
- <i>Hey, Ben. It's Jamie.</i>

1139
00:57:39,232 --> 00:57:41,312
Jamie, you know you're not
supposed to use this line.

1140
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:44,821
Told you.

1141
00:57:46,197 --> 00:57:48,867
Okay, let's try number two out of 14.

1142
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:01,462
Ben Rickert.

1143
00:58:01,546 --> 00:58:03,548
Ben, why do you do that, man? I mean...

1144
00:58:03,631 --> 00:58:06,124
You're a retired trader, okay?
No one is listening to your calls.

1145
00:58:06,134 --> 00:58:07,917
<i>The NSA has a $52 billion
budget and the ability</i>

1146
00:58:07,927 --> 00:58:09,377
to monitor tens
of millions of calls a second.

1147
00:58:09,387 --> 00:58:11,723
You think they're not using it?

1148
00:58:11,806 --> 00:58:14,642
Hey, I promise I will refrain from saying

1149
00:58:14,726 --> 00:58:16,895
"Ben Rickert" and "dirty bomb"
in the same sent...

1150
00:58:18,771 --> 00:58:20,411
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- I'm sorry, dude.

1151
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:23,151
Ben Rickert.

1152
00:58:23,276 --> 00:58:25,653
Did you get a chance to look
at what we sent you, Ben?

1153
00:58:25,737 --> 00:58:27,906
It's Charlie. I'm here, too.

1154
00:58:28,656 --> 00:58:30,992
<i>Hi, Charlie. Yeah, I did. Hold on.</i>

1155
00:58:36,998 --> 00:58:39,334
- Ben, you still there?
- Yeah.

1156
00:58:40,084 --> 00:58:42,128
I'll be honest, gentlemen.

1157
00:58:42,211 --> 00:58:44,130
It scared the shit out of me.

1158
00:58:44,255 --> 00:58:45,632
But that's a good thing, right?

1159
00:58:45,715 --> 00:58:48,509
That means this Vennett guy's
not wrong.

1160
00:58:49,218 --> 00:58:50,303
No, he's not.

1161
00:58:53,014 --> 00:58:54,015
Cool.

1162
00:58:54,098 --> 00:58:55,683
Tell me more about these CDOs.

1163
00:58:55,767 --> 00:58:59,520
<i>Yeah, yeah. Okay, so, you know,
Vennett mentions the CDOs,</i>

1164
00:58:59,646 --> 00:59:01,189
but actually, we took a look

1165
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:02,992
and they're way worse
than even he realizes.

1166
00:59:03,024 --> 00:59:04,442
These things don't make any sense!

1167
00:59:04,525 --> 00:59:05,777
<i>We can't even model them.</i>

1168
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:08,571
These are 100 times bigger
than the MBS.

1169
00:59:08,655 --> 00:59:10,239
And 90% AAA-rated.

1170
00:59:10,323 --> 00:59:12,075
- Yes! Exactly!
- Over 90%.

1171
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,284
<i>It's incredible.</i>

1172
00:59:13,368 --> 00:59:16,537
I took a good hard look
at the CDOs you want to short.

1173
00:59:17,288 --> 00:59:19,707
They're brilliant. Worthless. Total crap.

1174
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:22,543
Jamie. Very good.

1175
00:59:22,627 --> 00:59:26,130
What can I say? I'm good at finding shit.

1176
00:59:26,214 --> 00:59:28,967
<i>So, Ben, we shorted
the BB's and the BBB's,</i>

1177
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:31,135
<i>and the risk is relatively low.</i>

1178
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:33,888
<i>- Payoff is, like, 25-to-1.
- Yeah.</i>

1179
00:59:36,224 --> 00:59:38,383
Okay, so, why are you calling me?
I don't do this anymore.

1180
00:59:38,393 --> 00:59:39,560
Look, Ben?

1181
00:59:40,895 --> 00:59:44,649
We need you to help us get the ISDA.

1182
00:59:44,732 --> 00:59:47,819
If we get a hunting license,
we can short this crap.

1183
00:59:47,902 --> 00:59:50,436
<i>And we know you hate Wall Street.
We're not asking you to do the trading.</i>

1184
00:59:50,446 --> 00:59:54,409
<i>We're simply asking you
to help us get a seat</i>

1185
00:59:54,492 --> 00:59:57,662
<i>at the fucking table.</i>

1186
00:59:57,745 --> 00:59:59,664
It's a pretty ugly table, guys.

1187
00:59:59,747 --> 01:00:04,752
Look, Ben, the system fucked up
in a big, big way here, okay?

1188
01:00:04,836 --> 01:00:06,921
And somehow

1189
01:00:07,255 --> 01:00:09,924
we know before anyone else.

1190
01:00:10,258 --> 01:00:13,177
You know? This is a
once-in-a-lifetime deal.

1191
01:00:15,763 --> 01:00:16,764
I'm thinking.

1192
01:00:21,853 --> 01:00:23,771
Okay. I'll call Deutsche Bank.

1193
01:00:23,855 --> 01:00:26,107
Thank you, Ben. Thank you.

1194
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:29,777
And Bear. What about Bear?
They have some reprehensible product.

1195
01:00:30,111 --> 01:00:32,447
<i>Okay. Bear will trade with anybody.</i>

1196
01:01:20,578 --> 01:01:23,331
All right. I'll see if I can push it through.

1197
01:01:23,414 --> 01:01:25,249
Thank you, Noah.
And thank Jared for us.

1198
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:29,754
- Couldn't we go inside?
- Yeah, me, too.

1199
01:02:13,881 --> 01:02:16,217
Hi. It's Mark. I need to talk
to Vinnie right now.

1200
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,720
We're just asking you to explain to us

1201
01:02:19,887 --> 01:02:22,348
just how it is that you are fucking us,

1202
01:02:22,431 --> 01:02:23,683
because what we are seeing...

1203
01:02:26,561 --> 01:02:27,895
Morgan Stanley building, fast.

1204
01:02:28,855 --> 01:02:31,315
Are we hooked up
to the same computer screen?

1205
01:02:31,399 --> 01:02:33,067
It doesn't make any sense.

1206
01:02:35,903 --> 01:02:37,363
<i>Vinnie, you there?</i>

1207
01:02:37,864 --> 01:02:39,824
- Mark, you there?
- Yeah, did you hear?

1208
01:02:39,907 --> 01:02:41,667
Mortgage defaults have gone
through the roof.

1209
01:02:41,742 --> 01:02:43,276
Is anybody jumping off of buildings yet?

1210
01:02:43,286 --> 01:02:45,496
Why would they?
Subprime mortgage bond prices are up.

1211
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:46,622
What?

1212
01:02:46,706 --> 01:02:50,001
Vennett wants $1.9 million
more in collateral by close.

1213
01:02:50,084 --> 01:02:51,450
Vennett's asking us to post collateral.

1214
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:52,879
What the hell is going on?

1215
01:02:52,962 --> 01:02:54,996
We don't know, but Deutsche's
on the phone demanding payment.

1216
01:02:55,006 --> 01:02:56,841
<i>Call Vennett. Call that little shit.</i>

1217
01:02:56,924 --> 01:02:58,885
Call Vennett.
Tell him to get his ass down here.

1218
01:02:58,968 --> 01:03:00,761
So subprime loans go bad,

1219
01:03:00,845 --> 01:03:04,056
but subprime bonds, which are made up
of subprime loans, are more valuable?

1220
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:06,601
I know. They want another
$1.9 million by market close.

1221
01:03:06,726 --> 01:03:08,853
What about the ratings agencies?
Moody's, S&P...

1222
01:03:08,936 --> 01:03:11,355
Are they downgrading the CDOs
and mortgage bonds?

1223
01:03:11,439 --> 01:03:12,597
Where are the ratings agencies at?

1224
01:03:12,607 --> 01:03:15,693
- They're the fucking same.
- No, they're all still AAA.

1225
01:03:15,776 --> 01:03:18,279
What the hell?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1226
01:03:18,362 --> 01:03:20,448
Those fuckers! Those motherfuckers!

1227
01:03:20,531 --> 01:03:23,531
They go public, and all they care about
is their bottom line and their shit.

1228
01:03:23,576 --> 01:03:25,328
Hey, Mark, that's not all.

1229
01:03:25,411 --> 01:03:26,777
The Morgan Stanley risk guys are here.

1230
01:03:26,787 --> 01:03:28,164
They called in Kathy Tao.

1231
01:03:28,247 --> 01:03:30,457
They're trying to convince her
to make us sell our swaps.

1232
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:32,710
Apparently, tying up six years
of insurance payments

1233
01:03:32,793 --> 01:03:34,545
in hopes of a housing Armageddon

1234
01:03:34,629 --> 01:03:37,256
<i>- is not prudent investing.</i>
- What did Kathy say?

1235
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:40,051
Nothing yet. She keeps asking if
this is one of your crusades.

1236
01:03:40,134 --> 01:03:42,053
Okay, I want you to walk back in there

1237
01:03:42,136 --> 01:03:46,599
and very calmly, very politely,
tell the risk assessors to fuck off.

1238
01:03:46,682 --> 01:03:48,362
And then meet me over
at Standard & Poor's.

1239
01:03:48,434 --> 01:03:49,936
We're gonna talk to Georgia.

1240
01:03:50,019 --> 01:03:51,062
<i>All right. Okay.</i>

1241
01:03:51,145 --> 01:03:53,064
Get that fuck Jared Vennett
in this office.

1242
01:03:53,147 --> 01:03:54,941
<i>I'm gonna bash his fucking head in.</i>

1243
01:04:00,196 --> 01:04:01,530
Gentlemen?

1244
01:04:01,614 --> 01:04:04,659
I spoke with Mark Baum.
He says to fuck off.

1245
01:04:18,464 --> 01:04:20,800
I can't see a damn thing.

1246
01:04:22,468 --> 01:04:24,679
My eye doctor's always busy.

1247
01:04:24,762 --> 01:04:26,629
I end up taking
any appointment they'll give me,

1248
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:28,975
and then the whole morning
gets shot to hell!

1249
01:04:30,142 --> 01:04:31,644
So...

1250
01:04:32,144 --> 01:04:33,646
All righty,

1251
01:04:34,021 --> 01:04:36,524
FrontPoint Partners,

1252
01:04:37,066 --> 01:04:39,443
how can Standard & Poor's help you?

1253
01:04:39,527 --> 01:04:40,778
Well, we don't understand why

1254
01:04:40,861 --> 01:04:43,489
the ratings agencies haven't
downgraded subprime bonds

1255
01:04:43,572 --> 01:04:46,617
since the underlying loans
are clearly deteriorating.

1256
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:49,120
Well, the delinquency rates
do have people worried,

1257
01:04:49,203 --> 01:04:50,997
but they're actually within our models.

1258
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,040
- So...
- Says you.

1259
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:56,627
...you're convinced
the underlying mortgages

1260
01:04:56,711 --> 01:04:59,130
in these bonds are solid loans.

1261
01:04:59,255 --> 01:05:01,132
That is our opinion, yes.

1262
01:05:01,215 --> 01:05:03,301
Have you looked at the loan-level data?

1263
01:05:03,384 --> 01:05:05,136
I mean, they're giving these loans

1264
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:06,544
to anybody
with a credit score and a pulse.

1265
01:05:06,554 --> 01:05:09,140
Excuse me, sir. What do you
think we do here all day?

1266
01:05:09,223 --> 01:05:10,339
We're not sure. That's why we're here.

1267
01:05:10,349 --> 01:05:11,549
Here's what I don't understand...

1268
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:13,269
We check, recheck, recheck again.

1269
01:05:13,394 --> 01:05:14,760
If these mortgage bonds are so stable...

1270
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:16,480
Perhaps you could check your friend.

1271
01:05:16,564 --> 01:05:18,566
...have you ever refused to rate...

1272
01:05:18,649 --> 01:05:19,984
Ma'am, that's delusional.

1273
01:05:20,067 --> 01:05:21,193
We stand behind them.

1274
01:05:21,277 --> 01:05:22,862
Georgia, have you ever refused to rate

1275
01:05:22,945 --> 01:05:26,240
any of these bonds
upper tranches AAA?

1276
01:05:26,324 --> 01:05:27,908
Can we see the paperwork
on those deals?

1277
01:05:27,992 --> 01:05:29,994
I am under no obligation
to share that information

1278
01:05:30,077 --> 01:05:31,235
with you, whoever you might be.

1279
01:05:31,245 --> 01:05:32,955
Just answer the question, Georgia.

1280
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,041
Can you name one time in the past year

1281
01:05:35,124 --> 01:05:36,459
where you checked the tape

1282
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:40,755
and you didn't give the banks
the AAA percentage they wanted?

1283
01:05:43,007 --> 01:05:44,248
If we don't give them the ratings,

1284
01:05:44,258 --> 01:05:46,177
they'll go to Moody's,
right down the block.

1285
01:05:47,094 --> 01:05:50,431
If we don't work with them,
they will go to our competitors.

1286
01:05:51,098 --> 01:05:54,268
Not our fault.
Simply the way the world works.

1287
01:05:58,606 --> 01:06:01,108
- Holy shit.
- Yes, now you see.

1288
01:06:02,151 --> 01:06:04,195
And I never said that.

1289
01:06:04,278 --> 01:06:06,697
They're selling ratings for fees.

1290
01:06:06,781 --> 01:06:07,740
A ratings shop.

1291
01:06:07,823 --> 01:06:10,659
You can afford to make less. Make less.

1292
01:06:10,743 --> 01:06:12,620
Nobody said that.

1293
01:06:12,703 --> 01:06:14,872
And it is not my decision.
I have a boss.

1294
01:06:14,955 --> 01:06:17,750
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I am not "kidding you".

1295
01:06:17,833 --> 01:06:20,127
How'd your boss do on the IPO?

1296
01:06:20,211 --> 01:06:21,491
Is that the angle you're taking?

1297
01:06:21,504 --> 01:06:25,049
So, now, anyone who has a boss
can't be held responsible

1298
01:06:25,132 --> 01:06:26,572
for doing shitty and illegal things.

1299
01:06:26,634 --> 01:06:28,219
What are you, four?

1300
01:06:28,302 --> 01:06:32,598
No, lam not four, Mr. Baum.
I am not, no.

1301
01:06:32,681 --> 01:06:36,060
And I wonder
what your incentives might be.

1302
01:06:36,185 --> 01:06:37,728
Is it maybe in your best interest

1303
01:06:37,812 --> 01:06:40,815
to have the ratings change?
Is it, perhaps?

1304
01:06:42,608 --> 01:06:44,527
How many credit default swaps
do you own?

1305
01:06:47,196 --> 01:06:49,073
It doesn't make me wrong.

1306
01:06:49,156 --> 01:06:50,282
No.

1307
01:06:50,366 --> 01:06:52,493
It just makes you a hypocrite.

1308
01:07:33,117 --> 01:07:35,119
Fuck!

1309
01:07:35,202 --> 01:07:36,402
<i>Mortgage delinquencies went up</i>

1310
01:07:36,412 --> 01:07:38,456
<i>and the CDOs got more
valuable. Unbelievable.</i>

1311
01:07:38,539 --> 01:07:40,791
<i>- Unbelievable.
- We know. It's completely backwards.</i>

1312
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:42,460
<i>I just called an old friend at Bear.</i>

1313
01:07:42,543 --> 01:07:44,211
<i>He didn't even know what a CDO is.</i>

1314
01:07:44,295 --> 01:07:48,632
Yeah, I just had to wire
Bear and Deutsche $70,000.

1315
01:07:48,716 --> 01:07:51,051
It's like two plus two equals

1316
01:07:51,552 --> 01:07:52,720
fish.

1317
01:07:52,803 --> 01:07:55,473
It's rigged.
We bought into a rigged game.

1318
01:07:55,556 --> 01:07:57,349
We're gonna lose everything.

1319
01:07:57,433 --> 01:07:59,894
I'm gonna have to move back
in with my mom.

1320
01:08:00,436 --> 01:08:01,812
Can't do that.

1321
01:08:01,896 --> 01:08:04,064
<i>All right. Well, I got
a colonic appointment.</i>

1322
01:08:04,148 --> 01:08:05,816
Wait a minute. Hold on, Ben.

1323
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,234
Ben, look.

1324
01:08:07,318 --> 01:08:09,695
Either the banks are clueless

1325
01:08:09,778 --> 01:08:12,072
and they don't know
how to value these CDOs,

1326
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:17,161
or they're such crooks that
the CDOs are worth shit

1327
01:08:17,328 --> 01:08:18,913
and they're hiding it.

1328
01:08:21,248 --> 01:08:22,708
I think we should buy more swaps.

1329
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,293
What?

1330
01:08:24,376 --> 01:08:26,378
Suck it up and pay up, fellas.
We made a deal.

1331
01:08:26,462 --> 01:08:28,506
No way! No!

1332
01:08:28,589 --> 01:08:30,007
Are you fucking kidding me?

1333
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:32,426
Are you serious?
You think this is a game?

1334
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:35,179
- No.No.No.No.No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1335
01:08:41,727 --> 01:08:43,395
No! No! No!

1336
01:08:43,521 --> 01:08:45,189
<i>No, seriously, a colonic once a year.</i>

1337
01:08:45,272 --> 01:08:46,273
Ass!

1338
01:08:46,357 --> 01:08:49,360
And you got a matching little butler boy,
you buttfuck!

1339
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:54,865
- Are you done?
- I think so, yeah.

1340
01:08:54,949 --> 01:08:57,701
God! I pulled a muscle
in my back from yelling.

1341
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:03,624
Mortgage defaults
have done nothing but go up.

1342
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:07,127
Yet you quote us
a higher price on the bonds.

1343
01:09:08,003 --> 01:09:10,204
Please explain that to me.
There's no way that makes sense.

1344
01:09:10,214 --> 01:09:13,217
There's no way you're marking
these swaps appropriately.

1345
01:09:13,884 --> 01:09:15,844
Why shouldn't we back out
of this trade right now?

1346
01:09:18,305 --> 01:09:21,725
Didn't I say when we made this deal
that the ratings agencies, the SEC

1347
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:24,311
and the big banks were clueless?
Didn't I say that?

1348
01:09:24,395 --> 01:09:25,688
- Yes.
- Didn't I say it?

1349
01:09:25,771 --> 01:09:27,606
Yes, you did. You did.

1350
01:09:27,731 --> 01:09:29,191
Shut up.

1351
01:09:29,275 --> 01:09:30,683
Now their foot's on fire, they think

1352
01:09:30,693 --> 01:09:32,309
their steak is done,
and you're surprised?

1353
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:35,114
That's not stupidity. That's fraud.

1354
01:09:35,197 --> 01:09:36,981
Tell me the difference
between stupid and illegal,

1355
01:09:36,991 --> 01:09:38,993
and I'll have my wife's brother arrested.

1356
01:09:40,869 --> 01:09:41,870
That was funny.

1357
01:09:41,996 --> 01:09:45,666
I guess you just don't realize
how clueless the system really is.

1358
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:48,085
Yes, there's some shady shit
going down,

1359
01:09:48,168 --> 01:09:51,505
but trust me, it's fueled by stupidity!

1360
01:09:52,715 --> 01:09:54,049
Look at yourselves.

1361
01:09:54,842 --> 01:09:58,304
You know, you pass yourself off
as cynical people

1362
01:09:58,387 --> 01:10:00,764
but you still have some faith
in the system, don't you?

1363
01:10:00,848 --> 01:10:02,141
I don't.

1364
01:10:02,224 --> 01:10:05,102
Well, except for Vinnie.
And who gives a shit?

1365
01:10:05,185 --> 01:10:06,937
- No way!
- Look...

1366
01:10:07,021 --> 01:10:10,190
Either we're right or we're wrong
in a giant, giant way.

1367
01:10:10,274 --> 01:10:12,151
And if we're wrong,
then we got to find someone

1368
01:10:12,234 --> 01:10:13,861
to help us get out of this trade.

1369
01:10:13,944 --> 01:10:16,697
I'm not feeling remotely
confident that we're right.

1370
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:20,200
And if we're wrong,
who's gonna tell us?

1371
01:10:20,284 --> 01:10:23,704
Who understands this stuff?
It makes no sense!

1372
01:10:26,165 --> 01:10:27,958
<i>I think we need to go to Vegas.</i>

1373
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:30,210
- What's in Vegas?
- Vegas?

1374
01:10:30,294 --> 01:10:32,171
What the hell's in Las Vegas?

1375
01:10:33,255 --> 01:10:36,467
The American Securitization
Forum is there next week.

1376
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:38,969
Every bond and CDO salesman,
subprime lender

1377
01:10:39,053 --> 01:10:41,138
and swap trader is gonna be there.

1378
01:10:41,221 --> 01:10:43,974
I'm telling you,
your bet is against dumb money.

1379
01:10:44,058 --> 01:10:46,894
It's about time you find out
just how dumb that money really is.

1380
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:48,103
God, I hate Vegas.

1381
01:10:48,228 --> 01:10:49,720
I hear the food has gotten
really good in Vegas.

1382
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:51,231
They have a Nobu now.

1383
01:10:51,315 --> 01:10:52,691
Would you fucking stop it?

1384
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:40,280
Any sense?

1385
01:11:40,447 --> 01:11:41,949
And if a bond is "rich" it is...

1386
01:11:42,282 --> 01:11:45,369
- I don't know, loaded with assets?
- "Rich" just means overpriced.

1387
01:11:45,452 --> 01:11:47,413
I can't sleep on planes,
so I did my homework.

1388
01:11:47,496 --> 01:11:49,915
Okay, let's focus. What's our goal?

1389
01:11:49,998 --> 01:11:52,334
To figure out if this
is a deal of a lifetime

1390
01:11:52,418 --> 01:11:54,211
or if everyone here knows
something we don't

1391
01:11:54,294 --> 01:11:56,130
and we're gonna get royally screwed.

1392
01:11:56,213 --> 01:11:58,966
Right. Remember that when you
meet with the guys from Bear.

1393
01:11:59,133 --> 01:12:00,884
I set you up with a face-to-face.

1394
01:12:00,968 --> 01:12:02,261
- Awesome.
- Where is that?

1395
01:12:02,344 --> 01:12:06,682
Holy shit. Five years ago,
Securitization was a loser convention.

1396
01:12:06,765 --> 01:12:08,851
100, maybe 200 people would show.

1397
01:12:08,976 --> 01:12:11,145
$500 billion a year later, you get this.

1398
01:12:11,228 --> 01:12:12,928
There's a lot of smug-looking
people in here, huh?

1399
01:12:12,938 --> 01:12:16,400
It's like someone hit a piñata
filled with white people who suck at golf.

1400
01:12:16,483 --> 01:12:17,985
I mean, who are all these clowns?

1401
01:12:18,068 --> 01:12:19,445
Come on. I think it looks fun.

1402
01:12:19,528 --> 01:12:22,990
Certainly. Vennett says these
are the people we're betting against.

1403
01:12:23,073 --> 01:12:24,950
- Yeah, here we go. Here we go.
- There he is.

1404
01:12:25,033 --> 01:12:26,785
Chris, on my left. Chris, on my left.

1405
01:12:27,244 --> 01:12:28,370
Gentlemen.

1406
01:12:28,454 --> 01:12:32,040
When do we get a chance to face time
with some of these lovely folks?

1407
01:12:32,124 --> 01:12:33,542
Chris, give him the keycards.

1408
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:34,950
Do you even know which
keycards you're giving out?

1409
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,034
- You're just giving them out?
- Thank you.

1410
01:12:36,044 --> 01:12:38,756
First of all, how was your travel?
How are you? Uneventful?

1411
01:12:38,839 --> 01:12:40,048
- Uneventful.
- Okay.

1412
01:12:40,132 --> 01:12:41,915
I've been here for six hours.
I've already been to the gym,

1413
01:12:41,925 --> 01:12:43,260
I had two poached eggs

1414
01:12:43,343 --> 01:12:45,043
and I played blackjack
with Harry Dean Stanton.

1415
01:12:45,053 --> 01:12:46,513
Thank you for your diary.

1416
01:12:46,972 --> 01:12:48,599
Face time. I'd like some face time.

1417
01:12:48,682 --> 01:12:50,215
Just remember.
We're here to gather information.

1418
01:12:50,225 --> 01:12:51,643
We're gathering information, okay?

1419
01:12:51,727 --> 01:12:54,104
We're not advertising
our short position. All right?

1420
01:12:54,188 --> 01:12:55,888
We don't want to spook
everybody. Can you do that?

1421
01:12:55,898 --> 01:12:57,514
I know you got a big mouth,
you like to run it.

1422
01:12:57,524 --> 01:12:59,359
Can you just keep it shut
for a few days?

1423
01:12:59,443 --> 01:13:00,486
Okay. Okay.

1424
01:13:00,569 --> 01:13:02,404
Yeah, don't worry. We'll play nice.

1425
01:13:02,529 --> 01:13:03,822
Ladies and gentlemen.

1426
01:13:03,906 --> 01:13:06,116
Business is good.

1427
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,618
Profits are strong

1428
01:13:07,701 --> 01:13:10,621
and the mortgage continues
to be the bedrock

1429
01:13:10,704 --> 01:13:13,040
on which this economy is built.

1430
01:13:17,711 --> 01:13:19,296
And, yes, we had to take some losses

1431
01:13:19,379 --> 01:13:22,674
in our subprime department
last year, but those losses

1432
01:13:22,758 --> 01:13:25,385
will be contained at only 5%.

1433
01:13:25,552 --> 01:13:27,679
Now, in our residential sector...

1434
01:13:27,763 --> 01:13:28,931
Mark, it's not a Q and A.

1435
01:13:29,056 --> 01:13:30,798
...our rollout of those
variable rate packages

1436
01:13:30,808 --> 01:13:32,434
were gobbled up by the consumers!

1437
01:13:32,559 --> 01:13:34,603
I have a question, please.

1438
01:13:37,564 --> 01:13:39,650
Sir, the Q and A is after my statements.

1439
01:13:39,733 --> 01:13:42,152
But you know what? You seem anxious.
How can I help you?

1440
01:13:42,236 --> 01:13:44,154
- Thank you. How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

1441
01:13:44,238 --> 01:13:47,366
Would you say that it is a possibility

1442
01:13:47,449 --> 01:13:52,079
or a probability that
subprime losses stop at 5%?

1443
01:13:52,287 --> 01:13:53,372
Thank you.

1444
01:13:53,455 --> 01:13:58,252
I would say it is a very
strong probability, indeed.

1445
01:13:58,752 --> 01:14:01,296
So back to the residential sector.

1446
01:14:01,421 --> 01:14:03,507
When we rolled out the new
variable rates package...

1447
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:05,175
Excuse me.

1448
01:14:07,594 --> 01:14:08,679
Yes, sir.

1449
01:14:08,762 --> 01:14:12,140
Zero! Zero!

1450
01:14:12,266 --> 01:14:15,018
There is a 0% chance

1451
01:14:15,102 --> 01:14:18,897
that your subprime losses
will stop at 5%.

1452
01:14:18,981 --> 01:14:20,065
Zero.

1453
01:14:20,148 --> 01:14:21,692
Excuse me.

1454
01:14:21,775 --> 01:14:22,818
I have to take this.

1455
01:14:22,901 --> 01:14:24,862
He must be from Bank of America.

1456
01:14:26,572 --> 01:14:29,314
- Our subprime department is fine.
- No, I'm not doing anything right now.

1457
01:14:29,324 --> 01:14:30,941
As I was saying,
our residential department...

1458
01:14:30,951 --> 01:14:32,119
How are the kids?

1459
01:14:32,244 --> 01:14:34,621
...consumers reacted to our packages...

1460
01:14:34,705 --> 01:14:36,373
Mark Baum really did that.

1461
01:14:36,456 --> 01:14:37,781
When we were in Vegas, he did that.

1462
01:14:37,791 --> 01:14:39,960
He said that, he took the call.

1463
01:14:40,419 --> 01:14:42,129
Now you see what I had to deal with?

1464
01:14:55,809 --> 01:14:57,936
Yeah, the Beretta... Meh.

1465
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:00,230
But this Uzi is fucking awesome!

1466
01:15:00,314 --> 01:15:02,900
I need this CDO machine
to run for another two years.

1467
01:15:02,983 --> 01:15:06,236
And then I'm rich as fuck
and I got my house in Aspen.

1468
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:09,531
But do you have any concerns
about the performance

1469
01:15:09,615 --> 01:15:11,199
of the underlying securitizations?

1470
01:15:11,283 --> 01:15:13,076
It's easy to see that delinquencies

1471
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:16,038
and default rates
are on the rise right now.

1472
01:15:16,121 --> 01:15:18,290
Could you please stop
being such a buzzkill, dude?

1473
01:15:18,665 --> 01:15:21,209
We didn't bring you out here
to talk about work, bro.

1474
01:15:21,293 --> 01:15:22,753
Why did you bring us out here?

1475
01:15:22,836 --> 01:15:26,048
Because we need to be able to
expense the ammo to a client.

1476
01:15:26,131 --> 01:15:29,134
I'm gonna go shoot some terrorists.
Watch how it's done, boys!

1477
01:15:29,343 --> 01:15:31,970
- These guys are morons.
- Fucking tool.

1478
01:15:32,679 --> 01:15:33,722
These guys are morons.

1479
01:15:34,848 --> 01:15:37,309
- Fuck, yes! Boom!
- Yeah, man!

1480
01:15:37,392 --> 01:15:39,843
We need to be buying up every swap
we can get our hands on here.

1481
01:15:39,853 --> 01:15:42,147
Just hold on, okay? Hold on.

1482
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:44,524
My brother's ex-girlfriend
works for the SEC.

1483
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:46,485
She just told me she's in town, okay?

1484
01:15:46,568 --> 01:15:48,695
So, if we're missing something,
maybe she can tell me.

1485
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:50,447
You know, give me some insight.

1486
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:52,282
In the meantime,
you go to the main floor

1487
01:15:52,366 --> 01:15:54,076
<i>and price some swaps.</i>

1488
01:15:54,534 --> 01:15:58,538
Well, actually, we're about to invest
in housing bonds, and...

1489
01:15:58,622 --> 01:16:01,291
I was wondering if the SEC
is worried about them at all.

1490
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:04,127
I know you're not allowed
to tell me specifics, but just generally.

1491
01:16:04,211 --> 01:16:06,421
We don't investigate mortgage bonds.

1492
01:16:06,505 --> 01:16:09,841
Truth is, since we got our budget cut,
we don't investigate much.

1493
01:16:11,885 --> 01:16:14,846
- Then why are you here? I thought...
- I'm not here for the SEC.

1494
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:16,598
I'm here on my own dime.

1495
01:16:17,557 --> 01:16:20,769
I'm floating my resume
to some big banks.

1496
01:16:20,852 --> 01:16:22,437
How's your brother, by the way?

1497
01:16:22,521 --> 01:16:24,398
How are you floating
your resume to big banks?

1498
01:16:24,481 --> 01:16:27,361
I mean, you're supposed to be the ones,
you know, policing the big banks.

1499
01:16:27,401 --> 01:16:28,819
Grow up, Jamie.

1500
01:16:28,902 --> 01:16:32,656
There must be some kind of law
against working for a financial institution

1501
01:16:32,739 --> 01:16:35,951
right after you've been working
in financial regulation, right?

1502
01:16:36,034 --> 01:16:38,120
No. No.

1503
01:16:39,621 --> 01:16:41,748
Hey! Dougie!

1504
01:16:42,582 --> 01:16:45,544
Hey! Come over here.
What are you doing at Caesars?

1505
01:16:45,627 --> 01:16:47,129
He's at Goldman.

1506
01:16:47,754 --> 01:16:48,797
See you.

1507
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,927
We can do BBB-level swaps
at 500 basis points. Maybe.

1508
01:16:54,011 --> 01:16:57,806
You're pricing the swaps
like the bond is gonna collapse

1509
01:16:57,889 --> 01:17:00,267
even though the bond value's
going up? Really?

1510
01:17:00,809 --> 01:17:01,893
Sign of the times.

1511
01:17:01,977 --> 01:17:03,017
What the hell is going on?

1512
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:05,665
Lewis, can you come in
early tomorrow, please?

1513
01:18:05,749 --> 01:18:08,043
I need to unload the
AIG and Countrywide

1514
01:18:08,126 --> 01:18:09,586
and Freddie Mac positions

1515
01:18:09,669 --> 01:18:12,172
so that we can afford
the premiums on the...

1516
01:18:13,423 --> 01:18:16,343
...core mortgage shorts on the swaps.

1517
01:18:16,802 --> 01:18:18,303
No problem, Dr. Burry.

1518
01:18:20,347 --> 01:18:21,515
Dr. Burry?

1519
01:18:25,102 --> 01:18:26,144
If the investors withdraw,

1520
01:18:26,228 --> 01:18:28,980
what's going to happen here?
Are we done?

1521
01:18:29,106 --> 01:18:31,024
Honestly, I don't know.

1522
01:18:38,698 --> 01:18:40,951
The bonds aren't going down.

1523
01:18:42,202 --> 01:18:44,871
They won't move. It's possible

1524
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:49,876
that we are in a completely
fraudulent system.

1525
01:18:51,294 --> 01:18:53,964
Or... you're wrong.

1526
01:18:58,718 --> 01:18:59,803
Sure.

1527
01:19:00,554 --> 01:19:04,558
It's possible I'm wrong.
I just don't know how.

1528
01:19:09,271 --> 01:19:13,441
I guess when someone's wrong,
they never...

1529
01:19:13,817 --> 01:19:16,069
They never know how.

1530
01:19:20,365 --> 01:19:22,576
- See you in the morning.
- Yeah.

1531
01:19:24,369 --> 01:19:26,371
Even Bear upped their prices.

1532
01:19:26,955 --> 01:19:29,457
And they keep calling us Brownhole.

1533
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:31,241
You just don't have the money
or the reputation.

1534
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:32,586
Don't take it personally.

1535
01:19:32,711 --> 01:19:34,077
I don't think I have
the strip club in me tonight.

1536
01:19:34,087 --> 01:19:37,757
I'm just gonna get some ginger ale
and watch some pay-per-view.

1537
01:19:37,841 --> 01:19:40,218
I'll book us some flights out
for the morning.

1538
01:19:41,636 --> 01:19:44,264
A deal. We need a deal, right? A deal.

1539
01:19:44,347 --> 01:19:46,141
We need a deal we can afford.

1540
01:19:46,266 --> 01:19:48,560
We need a deal
that they're not gonna refuse.

1541
01:19:48,643 --> 01:19:51,993
So... what can we do?
We can...

1542
01:19:53,273 --> 01:19:56,193
The AA tranches. What if we
bet against the AA tranches?

1543
01:19:56,276 --> 01:19:57,611
Who's not gonna take that bet?

1544
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,240
We know that they say
they're 95% AAA-rated,

1545
01:20:01,323 --> 01:20:03,325
but in reality they're more like 25%.

1546
01:20:03,408 --> 01:20:05,827
Some of them are 0%!

1547
01:20:05,911 --> 01:20:08,538
We also know that if the
bottom tranches fail at over 8%,

1548
01:20:08,622 --> 01:20:09,863
the upper tranches are affected.

1549
01:20:09,873 --> 01:20:11,082
They go to zero.

1550
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:14,294
I'll bet you right now
that those AA's are actually like B's.

1551
01:20:14,753 --> 01:20:17,839
I rarely ever say these words,
but I think Charlie's right.

1552
01:20:18,173 --> 01:20:19,841
Look, Ben.

1553
01:20:21,509 --> 01:20:22,928
The payoff

1554
01:20:23,428 --> 01:20:24,846
is 200 to 1.

1555
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:26,973
But they're all taking
the ratings at face value.

1556
01:20:27,098 --> 01:20:30,477
So they're charging pennies
on the dollar a bet against the AA's.

1557
01:20:32,103 --> 01:20:34,940
Just when I start thinking
you guys are clowns...

1558
01:20:35,023 --> 01:20:37,525
No one on the planet's
betting against AA's.

1559
01:20:37,609 --> 01:20:40,528
The banks will think we're either high
or having a stroke.

1560
01:20:40,612 --> 01:20:42,948
They'll take every dime we have to offer.

1561
01:20:45,533 --> 01:20:46,868
Kinda brilliant.

1562
01:20:48,662 --> 01:20:50,747
This is what we did
that no one else thought of.

1563
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:53,750
Not even Baum or Burry
thought to short the AA's.

1564
01:20:53,833 --> 01:20:55,210
But we did.

1565
01:20:55,293 --> 01:20:56,836
Little Brownhole Capital.

1566
01:20:57,170 --> 01:21:02,092
We're interested in shorting
some of the AA tranche of CDOs.

1567
01:21:02,175 --> 01:21:03,969
Come on, guys, what's the angle?

1568
01:21:04,052 --> 01:21:06,346
Oh, got no angle. We're new to this.
We're just excited.

1569
01:21:06,471 --> 01:21:10,183
We want to do $15 million
in swaps on the AA tranche.

1570
01:21:10,642 --> 01:21:11,726
I don't understand.

1571
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:14,437
You can buy as much AA tranche
as you want.

1572
01:21:16,648 --> 01:21:18,775
$40 million against the AA.

1573
01:21:18,858 --> 01:21:21,069
Brother, I will sell you
as much as you want.

1574
01:21:21,361 --> 01:21:23,571
You understand perfectly, Bob.
You want the deal?

1575
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:27,742
That's cool. That's all right with me.

1576
01:21:29,953 --> 01:21:31,162
Pleasure.

1577
01:21:39,379 --> 01:21:41,298
Don't do that. Stop. Stop.

1578
01:21:42,007 --> 01:21:43,216
- Stop that.
- Charlie.

1579
01:21:43,925 --> 01:21:45,385
Stop it! Stop.

1580
01:21:47,804 --> 01:21:48,888
What?

1581
01:21:50,307 --> 01:21:51,867
Do you have any idea what you just did?

1582
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:53,842
Come on. We just made
the deal of our lifetimes!

1583
01:21:53,852 --> 01:21:55,020
We should celebrate.

1584
01:21:55,103 --> 01:21:57,022
You just bet against
the American economy.

1585
01:21:57,105 --> 01:21:58,606
Fuck, yeah, we did!

1586
01:21:58,690 --> 01:22:00,650
- Fuck, yeah!
- Which means...

1587
01:22:00,734 --> 01:22:03,403
Which means if we're right...

1588
01:22:04,446 --> 01:22:07,824
If we're right, people lose homes.
People lose jobs.

1589
01:22:07,907 --> 01:22:11,077
People lose retirement savings.
People lose pensions.

1590
01:22:11,202 --> 01:22:12,444
You know what I hate
about fucking banking?

1591
01:22:12,454 --> 01:22:14,070
It reduces people to numbers.
Here's a number.

1592
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,916
Every 1% unemployment goes up,
40,000 people die. Did you know that?

1593
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,501
- No.
- Did you know that?

1594
01:22:18,585 --> 01:22:20,170
No, I didn't know that.

1595
01:22:21,629 --> 01:22:23,298
We were just excited.

1596
01:22:25,717 --> 01:22:27,719
Just don't fucking dance.

1597
01:22:28,386 --> 01:22:30,221
- All right.
- Where are you going?

1598
01:22:34,601 --> 01:22:36,770
Whoa, I just got really scared.

1599
01:22:38,313 --> 01:22:40,231
First of all, great show today.

1600
01:22:40,315 --> 01:22:41,775
- You were terrific.
- Thank you.

1601
01:22:41,858 --> 01:22:43,485
Your big mouth was a revelation.

1602
01:22:43,568 --> 01:22:45,278
I appreciate that.

1603
01:22:45,403 --> 01:22:47,228
You worried you and your swaps
are getting played?

1604
01:22:47,238 --> 01:22:50,367
Well, this is an opportunity for you
to meet who you're betting against.

1605
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:52,317
Try not to get too righteous
and listen a little.

1606
01:22:52,327 --> 01:22:53,703
Okay, fine. Who is this guy?

1607
01:22:53,828 --> 01:22:55,497
<i>A real solid-gold asshole.</i>

1608
01:22:55,663 --> 01:22:57,916
- I'm a CDO manager.
- A "CDO manager"?

1609
01:22:57,999 --> 01:22:59,417
Yeah, at Harding Advisors.

1610
01:23:00,001 --> 01:23:03,129
I didn't realize that there was
anything to manage with CDOs.

1611
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,385
We select the securities
that go into the CDO portfolio

1612
01:23:08,468 --> 01:23:09,844
and monitor the assets.

1613
01:23:09,928 --> 01:23:11,721
I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs.

1614
01:23:11,805 --> 01:23:14,766
Do you represent the investors
or Merrill Lynch?

1615
01:23:14,849 --> 01:23:16,935
- The investors.
- You do.

1616
01:23:17,102 --> 01:23:18,436
- Yeah.
- But...

1617
01:23:18,645 --> 01:23:20,525
Merrill Lynch isn't gonna send you
any customers

1618
01:23:20,605 --> 01:23:24,150
unless you put Merrill Lynch's bonds
in your CDO.

1619
01:23:25,276 --> 01:23:27,987
Good question. Let's just say
Merrill and I have...

1620
01:23:28,613 --> 01:23:30,698
We have a good relationship.

1621
01:23:30,824 --> 01:23:33,034
You have a good relationship
with Merrill Lynch.

1622
01:23:33,118 --> 01:23:34,859
We've been doing business
together for a long time.

1623
01:23:34,869 --> 01:23:37,330
And so the CDOs that you create

1624
01:23:37,455 --> 01:23:41,376
are of the highest quality
and the highest value.

1625
01:23:41,459 --> 01:23:43,378
- Absolutely. Yep.
- Absolutely.

1626
01:23:43,461 --> 01:23:47,006
Are you at all concerned
about the rising default rates?

1627
01:23:48,967 --> 01:23:52,137
I assume no risk for these
products myself, Mark.

1628
01:23:54,806 --> 01:23:55,974
Okay.

1629
01:23:57,559 --> 01:24:00,728
So let me get this straight.
The bank calls you up.

1630
01:24:01,312 --> 01:24:02,929
They give you the bonds
they want to sell.

1631
01:24:02,939 --> 01:24:04,274
They give you clients,

1632
01:24:04,357 --> 01:24:06,734
they give you money to run
your business.

1633
01:24:06,818 --> 01:24:08,528
Give you fat fees for doing so.

1634
01:24:08,611 --> 01:24:10,613
But you represent the investors?

1635
01:24:12,157 --> 01:24:14,367
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1636
01:24:14,451 --> 01:24:15,984
But we're not
in the Merrill Lynch building.

1637
01:24:15,994 --> 01:24:17,652
- Okay. Where are you?
- We're in New Jersey.

1638
01:24:17,662 --> 01:24:19,747
You're 20 minutes away.

1639
01:24:19,831 --> 01:24:21,749
Well, five if you use a helicopter.

1640
01:24:23,626 --> 01:24:26,045
- That's funny, huh?
- That's hilarious.

1641
01:24:29,257 --> 01:24:30,300
Oh, boy.

1642
01:24:30,675 --> 01:24:32,886
Your boss is about to explode.

1643
01:24:32,969 --> 01:24:34,596
No, he's too curious to explode.

1644
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:36,139
Hold on. Say that again.

1645
01:24:36,222 --> 01:24:38,352
CDO "A" has parts of CDO "B".

1646
01:24:38,433 --> 01:24:40,353
And CDO "B" has parts of CDO "A".

1647
01:24:40,435 --> 01:24:42,695
But then they both
get put inside CDO "C".

1648
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:44,522
Yeah, that one's called CDO squared.

1649
01:24:44,606 --> 01:24:46,691
"A CDO of a CDO".

1650
01:24:47,108 --> 01:24:48,109
All right?

1651
01:24:48,276 --> 01:24:50,236
And then there's CDOs made up
of the opposite side

1652
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,863
of the bet you made with your swaps.

1653
01:24:52,113 --> 01:24:54,407
We call them synthetic CDOs.

1654
01:24:54,532 --> 01:24:56,701
What did you say? Synthetic CDOs.

1655
01:24:56,784 --> 01:25:00,288
- That is fucking crazy.
- It's not. It's awesome.

1656
01:25:01,706 --> 01:25:05,210
His face is starting to boil.
He looks like the bad guy from <i>Dune.</i>

1657
01:25:09,297 --> 01:25:11,216
All right, let's say

1658
01:25:11,716 --> 01:25:15,053
you have a pool of $50 million
in subprime loans.

1659
01:25:15,386 --> 01:25:17,972
How much money could be
out there betting on it,

1660
01:25:18,056 --> 01:25:20,850
in your synthetic CDOs and swaps

1661
01:25:20,934 --> 01:25:22,519
right now, tonight?

1662
01:25:22,602 --> 01:25:25,230
Let's see, $50 million...

1663
01:25:26,231 --> 01:25:28,233
- A billion dollars.
- What?

1664
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,392
<i>If the mortgage bonds
that Michael Burry discovered</i>

1665
01:25:31,402 --> 01:25:32,737
<i>were the match...</i>

1666
01:25:34,155 --> 01:25:36,574
How much bigger is the market
for insuring mortgage bonds

1667
01:25:36,658 --> 01:25:38,117
than actual mortgages?

1668
01:25:39,285 --> 01:25:40,453
About 20 times.

1669
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:42,705
<i>If the mortgage bonds were the match</i>

1670
01:25:42,789 --> 01:25:45,500
<i>and the CDOs were
the kerosene-soaked rags,</i>

1671
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:47,627
<i>then the synthetic CDO
was the atomic bomb</i>

1672
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:49,420
<i>with the drunk President
holding his finger</i>

1673
01:25:49,504 --> 01:25:50,672
<i>over the button.</i>

1674
01:25:50,755 --> 01:25:53,007
<i>It was at that moment
in that dumb restaurant</i>

1675
01:25:53,091 --> 01:25:56,261
<i>with that stupid look on his face
that Mark Baum realized</i>

1676
01:25:56,344 --> 01:25:58,763
<i>that the whole world economy
might collapse.</i>

1677
01:26:02,392 --> 01:26:04,310
<i>And I know what you're thinking.</i>

1678
01:26:04,394 --> 01:26:06,729
<i>"What the fuck is a synthetic CDO?"</i>

1679
01:26:09,107 --> 01:26:12,735
<i>Well, here's Dr. Richard Thaler,
father of behavioral economics</i>

1680
01:26:12,819 --> 01:26:15,446
<i>and Selena Gomez to explain.</i>

1681
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:18,950
Okay. So here's how
a synthetic CDO works.

1682
01:26:19,033 --> 01:26:21,911
Let's say I bet $10 million
on a blackjack hand.

1683
01:26:21,995 --> 01:26:24,497
$10 million because this hand
is meant to represent

1684
01:26:24,872 --> 01:26:27,125
a single mortgage bond.

1685
01:26:30,086 --> 01:26:33,506
Okay, Selena has a pretty good
hand here, showing 18.

1686
01:26:33,631 --> 01:26:34,632
Dealer showing seven.

1687
01:26:34,716 --> 01:26:36,759
That's a really good hand for Selena.

1688
01:26:36,843 --> 01:26:38,334
Good odds. In fact,
her chances of winning

1689
01:26:38,344 --> 01:26:40,722
<i>this hand are 87%.</i>

1690
01:26:40,805 --> 01:26:44,183
So, my odds are good.
I'm on a winning streak.

1691
01:26:44,267 --> 01:26:46,936
Everybody in this place
wants to get in on the action.

1692
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:48,396
How could I lose, right?

1693
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:49,981
Now, this is a classic error.

1694
01:26:50,064 --> 01:26:53,026
In basketball it's called
the Hot Hand Fallacy.

1695
01:26:53,109 --> 01:26:55,653
A player makes a bunch
of shots in a row.

1696
01:26:55,737 --> 01:26:58,031
People are sure they're gonna
make the next one.

1697
01:26:58,114 --> 01:27:00,074
<i>People think that whatever's
happening now</i>

1698
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:02,910
<i>is gonna continue to happen
into the future.</i>

1699
01:27:02,994 --> 01:27:06,331
<i>During the real estate boom,
markets were going up and up</i>

1700
01:27:06,414 --> 01:27:08,134
and people thought
they would never go down.

1701
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:10,710
So people who are watching
and think that I won't lose

1702
01:27:10,793 --> 01:27:12,253
will make a side bet.

1703
01:27:12,337 --> 01:27:14,589
Now, this is the first synthetic CDO.

1704
01:27:14,672 --> 01:27:16,257
I love Selena Gomez.

1705
01:27:16,341 --> 01:27:17,842
I bet you $50 million she wins.

1706
01:27:17,925 --> 01:27:20,011
And I'll give you 3-to-1 odds.

1707
01:27:20,094 --> 01:27:23,931
3-to-1 odds? Okay, I'll take that bet.

1708
01:27:24,015 --> 01:27:27,352
Now, somebody else
is gonna want to make a bet

1709
01:27:27,435 --> 01:27:29,854
- on the outcome of their bet.
- Bet you 50 million she wins.

1710
01:27:29,937 --> 01:27:32,899
That will lead to synthetic
CDO number two.

1711
01:27:32,982 --> 01:27:36,152
Hey, I bet you $200 million
that lady in the glasses

1712
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:37,820
wins that bet.

1713
01:27:37,987 --> 01:27:41,074
She probably will win.
So I want a great payoff.

1714
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:43,576
- How about 20-to-1?
- Deal.

1715
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:48,206
And this will go on and on
with more and more synthetic CDOs.

1716
01:27:48,289 --> 01:27:52,335
And we can transform an original
$10 million investment

1717
01:27:52,502 --> 01:27:54,420
into billions of dollars.

1718
01:27:55,338 --> 01:27:56,678
You okay?

1719
01:27:58,091 --> 01:27:59,091
No.

1720
01:28:00,468 --> 01:28:02,303
I actually feel pretty sick.

1721
01:28:07,517 --> 01:28:09,435
So I'm going to leave.

1722
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:13,272
You think I'm a parasite,
don't you, Mr. Baum?

1723
01:28:13,981 --> 01:28:17,902
But, apparently, society values me
very much.

1724
01:28:18,945 --> 01:28:20,697
In fact, let's do this.

1725
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:25,743
I'll tell you how much I'm worth.

1726
01:28:26,285 --> 01:28:27,787
You tell me how much you're worth.

1727
01:28:28,996 --> 01:28:34,085
God, you are an incredibly
big piece of shit.

1728
01:28:39,841 --> 01:28:41,718
Short everything that guy has touched.

1729
01:28:41,801 --> 01:28:43,428
I want half a billion more in swaps.

1730
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:46,295
You sure about that?
The collateral calls could bankrupt you.

1731
01:28:46,305 --> 01:28:48,266
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Where are you going?

1732
01:28:48,349 --> 01:28:51,394
I am going to try to find
moral redemption

1733
01:28:51,477 --> 01:28:53,312
at the roulette table.

1734
01:29:57,502 --> 01:29:58,878
Hey, hey, hey!

1735
01:30:02,965 --> 01:30:04,425
Things are worse than I thought.

1736
01:30:06,552 --> 01:30:08,471
I honestly think
the economy might collapse.

1737
01:30:08,888 --> 01:30:10,014
But you've been saying

1738
01:30:10,097 --> 01:30:13,184
that the system's broken
for years, Mark. So...

1739
01:30:13,643 --> 01:30:15,561
Why are you so shocked?

1740
01:30:18,064 --> 01:30:21,484
It's more twisted
than I could have imagined.

1741
01:30:21,567 --> 01:30:23,444
You love to be the virtuous one.

1742
01:30:23,903 --> 01:30:25,488
I'm a banker. I'm a part of it.

1743
01:30:25,571 --> 01:30:27,865
You always have, Mark.
Like you're untainted.

1744
01:30:27,949 --> 01:30:31,410
It changed me.
It changed me into a person

1745
01:30:31,994 --> 01:30:33,830
who is not able to reach out
to someone...

1746
01:30:33,913 --> 01:30:35,832
He was in pain.
My brother was in real pain.

1747
01:30:36,415 --> 01:30:38,751
There's no perfect way to help.

1748
01:30:41,754 --> 01:30:44,215
It's sad. It's scary.

1749
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:47,510
So stop trying to fix the world.

1750
01:30:47,593 --> 01:30:48,678
He told me...

1751
01:30:48,761 --> 01:30:50,096
You're not a saint.

1752
01:30:50,179 --> 01:30:51,931
Saints don't live on Park Avenue.

1753
01:30:52,139 --> 01:30:53,766
...that he was having bad thoughts.

1754
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:56,644
Just feel the feelings like the rest of us.

1755
01:30:56,978 --> 01:31:01,148
<i>My first response
was to offer him some money.</i>

1756
01:31:01,482 --> 01:31:03,985
<i>I offered him fucking money!</i>

1757
01:31:09,657 --> 01:31:12,285
His face was so smashed.

1758
01:31:31,345 --> 01:31:32,680
That's right.

1759
01:32:39,372 --> 01:32:40,706
Michael?

1760
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:42,124
- Michael?
- Yes. Yes.

1761
01:32:42,208 --> 01:32:44,293
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, honey.

1762
01:32:44,377 --> 01:32:46,462
- You sure?
- Yeah, baby.

1763
01:32:48,297 --> 01:32:49,590
I'm fine.

1764
01:32:58,557 --> 01:33:00,226
<i>To all investors.</i>

1765
01:33:00,309 --> 01:33:01,394
<i>As you may know,</i>

1766
01:33:02,395 --> 01:33:05,982
<i>our agreement allows me
to take extraordinary measures</i>

1767
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:09,360
<i>when markets
aren't functioning properly.</i>

1768
01:33:09,443 --> 01:33:13,155
<i>I currently have reason to believe
the mortgage bond market</i>

1769
01:33:13,823 --> 01:33:15,574
<i>is fraudulent.</i>

1770
01:33:17,743 --> 01:33:22,498
<i>So, in order to protect investors
from this fraudulent market,</i>

1771
01:33:22,581 --> 01:33:25,835
<i>I've decided to restrict
investors' withdrawals</i>

1772
01:33:25,918 --> 01:33:27,586
<i>until further notice.</i>

1773
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:31,590
<i>Sincerely, Dr. Michael J. Burry.</i>

1774
01:34:39,241 --> 01:34:40,701
<i>I never would have guessed my life</i>

1775
01:34:40,785 --> 01:34:43,329
<i>could change as much as it
has since I moved to L.A.</i>

1776
01:34:43,412 --> 01:34:45,790
<i>It's not just, like, that easy
to, like, not see you.</i>

1777
01:34:45,873 --> 01:34:48,959
<i>He lashed out at rumors
he used performance enhancing drugs.</i>

1778
01:34:49,168 --> 01:34:50,586
This record is not tainted.

1779
01:34:50,669 --> 01:34:51,837
Oh, my God, dude.

1780
01:34:51,921 --> 01:34:53,631
Will you please stop changing
the channels?

1781
01:34:53,714 --> 01:34:55,341
- You're driving me crazy.
- All right.

1782
01:34:55,424 --> 01:34:57,384
- Fine.
- Just put the business news on.

1783
01:34:57,968 --> 01:35:00,596
<i>- ...and the S&P picked up three points.
- Jesus!</i>

1784
01:35:00,679 --> 01:35:02,431
<i>Mortgage meltdown continued today.</i>

1785
01:35:02,515 --> 01:35:05,226
<i>Subprime mortgage lender
New Century Financial,</i>

1786
01:35:05,351 --> 01:35:07,978
<i>once the industry leader, by the way,
filed for bankruptcy.</i>

1787
01:35:08,062 --> 01:35:10,439
<i>- The company immediately...
- Whoa,</i> whoa, whoa.

1788
01:35:10,606 --> 01:35:11,846
<i>Good time for my voice to</i> go...

1789
01:35:11,857 --> 01:35:14,110
<i>Fired 3,200 workers.</i>

1790
01:35:14,193 --> 01:35:16,529
<i>The manufacturing index also
fell in the month of March...</i>

1791
01:35:16,612 --> 01:35:17,696
It's starting.

1792
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:19,438
<i>...a warning that economic
growth could slow.</i>

1793
01:35:19,448 --> 01:35:22,451
<i>The Institute of Supply Management
also reported a rise in prices...</i>

1794
01:35:22,535 --> 01:35:24,161
I'm gonna call my mom.

1795
01:35:26,413 --> 01:35:29,291
<i>The principal source of the slowdown
in economic growth...</i>

1796
01:35:29,375 --> 01:35:31,418
Time and time and time again,

1797
01:35:31,544 --> 01:35:33,671
I have gone to bat for you, Mark!

1798
01:35:33,754 --> 01:35:35,121
We've known each other
for seven years...

1799
01:35:35,131 --> 01:35:37,466
She's got some lungs on her.
I'm impressed.

1800
01:35:38,634 --> 01:35:40,469
I can't help but enjoy it.

1801
01:35:41,387 --> 01:35:43,087
There's no fucking way.
There's no fucking way

1802
01:35:43,097 --> 01:35:44,557
that the big banks are that stupid.

1803
01:35:45,558 --> 01:35:47,393
Bye, Kathy!

1804
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,065
Well?

1805
01:35:54,275 --> 01:35:57,903
Kathy thinks that it would be a good idea
if we sold our shorts.

1806
01:35:57,987 --> 01:35:58,988
What else is new?

1807
01:35:59,071 --> 01:36:00,948
And she said that
Morgan Stanley will buy them.

1808
01:36:01,031 --> 01:36:02,032
Holy shit!

1809
01:36:02,741 --> 01:36:03,993
What did you say?

1810
01:36:04,076 --> 01:36:05,744
I told her we're not selling shit.

1811
01:36:11,917 --> 01:36:15,754
If you need the files for 2005...

1812
01:36:15,921 --> 01:36:18,924
Mr. Fields' suit is very specific
to files from the past year.

1813
01:36:19,675 --> 01:36:22,428
Good. Then get out.
Say hi to Lawrence for me.

1814
01:36:22,511 --> 01:36:23,679
Will do.

1815
01:36:26,724 --> 01:36:28,392
You can't call me back for a week?

1816
01:36:28,475 --> 01:36:30,311
<i>I am so sorry, Mike.</i>

1817
01:36:30,686 --> 01:36:33,856
<i>Goldman had a systems failure.
I lost a ton of messages.</i>

1818
01:36:33,939 --> 01:36:35,983
Yeah, B of A
said they had a power outage,

1819
01:36:36,108 --> 01:36:39,278
and Morgan Stanley
said their server crashed.

1820
01:36:39,403 --> 01:36:40,529
<i>That's weird.</i>

1821
01:36:40,613 --> 01:36:43,157
Well, I would call it improbable.

1822
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:46,785
So where do you have
our position marked?

1823
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:49,371
<i>I think it's the same, Mike.</i>

1824
01:36:49,455 --> 01:36:51,332
What? Can you explain
that to me, please,

1825
01:36:51,415 --> 01:36:54,710
because how can the value
of an insurance contract

1826
01:36:54,793 --> 01:36:59,006
not be affected by the demise
of the very thing it insures?

1827
01:36:59,089 --> 01:37:01,884
<i>They're independent markets.
They're not always correlated.</i>

1828
01:37:01,967 --> 01:37:02,968
<i>I know it sounds odd,</i>

1829
01:37:03,052 --> 01:37:05,512
<i>but these
are very complicated products.</i>

1830
01:37:06,347 --> 01:37:08,224
They are correlated.

1831
01:37:08,307 --> 01:37:10,382
They're gonna lose their houses,
they're gonna lose their jobs,

1832
01:37:10,392 --> 01:37:11,472
they're gonna lose their...

1833
01:37:14,271 --> 01:37:16,106
Will you listen to me?

1834
01:37:16,315 --> 01:37:18,943
This is like the end of capitalism.

1835
01:37:19,068 --> 01:37:22,404
This is like the Dark Ages all over again.

1836
01:37:23,447 --> 01:37:24,573
I don't want to talk to Dad.

1837
01:37:24,657 --> 01:37:27,201
Okay, I love you, too. Save your money.

1838
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:31,914
She says I need to be on Xanax
and double my dose of Zoloft.

1839
01:37:32,081 --> 01:37:34,041
I asked Bear Stearns to price our shorts.

1840
01:37:34,124 --> 01:37:35,764
They tell me the CDOs
still haven't moved.

1841
01:37:35,793 --> 01:37:37,586
This is fucking insane!

1842
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:39,245
You realize that?
These people are crooks

1843
01:37:39,255 --> 01:37:41,298
and they should be in prison.

1844
01:37:41,465 --> 01:37:42,591
Look at the TABX.

1845
01:37:42,675 --> 01:37:44,510
You can see that the CDOs
are worth zero!

1846
01:37:44,593 --> 01:37:46,877
So you know what they're doing, huh?
You know what they're doing, right?

1847
01:37:46,887 --> 01:37:48,555
Yeah. They're unloading them.

1848
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:51,934
They're selling their dog shit CDOs,
then they go to another bank

1849
01:37:52,017 --> 01:37:54,061
and short the shit they just fucking sold!

1850
01:37:54,228 --> 01:37:55,813
Let's go to the press, man!

1851
01:37:55,896 --> 01:37:59,191
This is a massive story.
Who wouldn't publish it?

1852
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:01,485
Robert Redford!

1853
01:38:01,902 --> 01:38:03,362
No, you don't understand!

1854
01:38:03,445 --> 01:38:05,531
I got it, guys. I got it.

1855
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:08,325
What am I supposed to do?

1856
01:38:08,409 --> 01:38:10,192
Do you want me to write a piece
called "We're All Fucked"?

1857
01:38:10,202 --> 01:38:12,079
Yes! That's a perfect title!

1858
01:38:12,162 --> 01:38:16,333
Casey, right now every bank in town
is unloading these shit bonds

1859
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,210
onto unsuspecting customers.

1860
01:38:18,294 --> 01:38:21,297
And they won't devalue them
until they get them off their books.

1861
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:23,841
This level of criminality
is unprecedented,

1862
01:38:23,924 --> 01:38:26,176
even on fucking Wall Street.

1863
01:38:27,303 --> 01:38:30,139
Jamie... And this is me
being honest here, okay?

1864
01:38:30,431 --> 01:38:32,975
It took me years to build my
relationships on Wall Street.

1865
01:38:33,058 --> 01:38:37,229
No bank or ratings agency
is going to confirm a story like this

1866
01:38:37,313 --> 01:38:39,815
just because
it comes from two guys in a...

1867
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:43,193
Sorry, garage band hedge fund
that thinks it's the apocalypse.

1868
01:38:44,862 --> 01:38:45,863
Wow.

1869
01:38:46,030 --> 01:38:48,939
I thought you were for real, Casey.
You know, I'll have to say I really did.

1870
01:38:48,949 --> 01:38:49,950
Really?

1871
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:52,359
Yeah, Jamie, you try being
for real with a three-year-old

1872
01:38:52,369 --> 01:38:54,204
and a wife getting her master's degree.

1873
01:38:54,455 --> 01:38:57,791
I'm not gonna burn my reputation
on your wild hunch.

1874
01:38:58,625 --> 01:38:59,793
Wow.

1875
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:01,128
Wow.

1876
01:39:01,295 --> 01:39:02,338
Thanks for coming, guys.

1877
01:39:02,421 --> 01:39:03,662
Totally fucking awesome to see you.

1878
01:39:03,672 --> 01:39:07,801
Yeah, Casey. I've always hated you,
because you were a prick in college

1879
01:39:07,885 --> 01:39:10,220
and you are a prick today!

1880
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:13,182
Thanks, Charlie.
Still living with your mom?

1881
01:39:13,724 --> 01:39:15,184
Charlie, come on!

1882
01:39:15,267 --> 01:39:17,186
Mark Baum again. Call me.

1883
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:19,396
Subprime bonds fell off a cliff.

1884
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:21,440
Rumor has it the default
numbers are huge.

1885
01:39:21,523 --> 01:39:24,318
Who got the remittance data early?
I bet it's Goldman.

1886
01:39:24,401 --> 01:39:25,736
Yeah, fuck you very much.

1887
01:39:25,819 --> 01:39:28,655
Jared, it's chaos down here.
Where are we?

1888
01:39:29,073 --> 01:39:32,284
"And Caesar wept, for there were
no more worlds to conquer."

1889
01:39:33,869 --> 01:39:35,120
Shane?

1890
01:39:35,496 --> 01:39:36,747
Shane?

1891
01:39:38,332 --> 01:39:41,043
Well, nobody's buying CDO
or mortgage bonds anymore

1892
01:39:41,126 --> 01:39:42,419
and everybody wants swaps.

1893
01:39:42,753 --> 01:39:45,089
<i>Swaps are now the most popular
product on the street.</i>

1894
01:39:45,172 --> 01:39:47,007
- That's good for us.
- Yes and no.

1895
01:39:47,091 --> 01:39:48,582
I heard from somebody
who heard from somebody...

1896
01:39:48,592 --> 01:39:51,303
No, Alex, no. Sorry.

1897
01:39:54,473 --> 01:39:56,308
Bennie Cleager over at
Morgan is taking on

1898
01:39:56,392 --> 01:39:57,992
<i>some heavy losses
in the bond department.</i>

1899
01:39:59,311 --> 01:40:00,979
<i>Your ship might be taking on water.</i>

1900
01:40:01,522 --> 01:40:03,857
<i>It might be time to get
our lifejacket and get out.</i>

1901
01:40:04,608 --> 01:40:06,110
<i>I'm jacked.</i>

1902
01:40:06,652 --> 01:40:09,154
I'm jacked! I'm jacked to the tits!

1903
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:10,823
Good.

1904
01:40:10,906 --> 01:40:12,991
<i>- Do you feel it?
- No.</i>

1905
01:40:19,164 --> 01:40:20,624
What'd you hear, Tommy?

1906
01:40:22,793 --> 01:40:23,794
It's happening.

1907
01:40:23,877 --> 01:40:25,712
Everybody wants our swaps.

1908
01:40:25,921 --> 01:40:27,923
Kathy's office is looking for you.

1909
01:40:28,257 --> 01:40:30,676
They're singing a different tune now,
aren't they?

1910
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:33,512
That's not good.

1911
01:40:38,350 --> 01:40:39,726
Maybe later. Not now.

1912
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:42,187
This is a joke. Never.

1913
01:40:45,691 --> 01:40:46,775
Listening.

1914
01:40:47,192 --> 01:40:48,777
<i>- Dr. Burry?
- Yeah.</i>

1915
01:40:48,861 --> 01:40:50,279
<i>Deeb Winston, Goldman Sachs.</i>

1916
01:40:50,362 --> 01:40:51,937
<i>Listen, I've been reviewing
your position.</i>

1917
01:40:51,947 --> 01:40:54,228
<i>I wanted to discuss your marks
and make sure they're fair.</i>

1918
01:40:54,283 --> 01:40:59,955
Yeah, I think you mean that you've
secured a net short position yourselves.

1919
01:41:00,122 --> 01:41:02,875
So you're free to mark my
swaps accurately for once

1920
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:05,711
because it's now
in your interest to do so.

1921
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:09,965
<i>I'm not sure what you want me to say.</i>

1922
01:41:10,132 --> 01:41:11,633
I think that...

1923
01:41:13,135 --> 01:41:15,220
I think that you've already said it.

1924
01:41:23,061 --> 01:41:25,262
You tell Jeff at Goldman
that I'm not transferring funds.

1925
01:41:25,272 --> 01:41:26,899
This is bullshit!

1926
01:41:34,072 --> 01:41:35,824
Okay, we'll talk later.

1927
01:41:36,325 --> 01:41:37,743
Thank you.

1928
01:41:40,245 --> 01:41:42,122
Thanks for coming so quickly, Mark.

1929
01:41:42,206 --> 01:41:43,540
Yeah.

1930
01:41:43,832 --> 01:41:45,157
I know you've been hearing rumblings

1931
01:41:45,167 --> 01:41:46,668
about some losses
Morgan has suffered.

1932
01:41:46,752 --> 01:41:48,712
- Congratulations.
- On what?

1933
01:41:51,089 --> 01:41:52,591
Thanks.

1934
01:41:52,674 --> 01:41:54,009
Having fun?

1935
01:41:55,052 --> 01:41:56,386
Yes.

1936
01:41:57,596 --> 01:41:58,931
Tons.

1937
01:41:59,431 --> 01:42:01,767
I just wanted you to know that...

1938
01:42:02,351 --> 01:42:04,031
That, yes, Morgan has suffered
some losses,

1939
01:42:04,102 --> 01:42:07,898
but our liquidity is strong
and there's no cause for concern.

1940
01:42:08,106 --> 01:42:10,943
Would Bennie Cleager be concerned?

1941
01:42:11,276 --> 01:42:12,611
Because word on the street

1942
01:42:12,694 --> 01:42:15,531
is that he took some
pretty heavy losses.

1943
01:42:16,865 --> 01:42:18,659
Kathy, come on. We know each other.

1944
01:42:18,742 --> 01:42:20,953
What's going on?

1945
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:22,871
How bad is this?

1946
01:42:23,038 --> 01:42:24,206
Okay.

1947
01:42:24,998 --> 01:42:28,043
Two years ago, Bennie Cleager
in Morgan's bond department

1948
01:42:28,126 --> 01:42:31,672
also started shorting subprime housing,
$2 billion in BBBs.

1949
01:42:31,755 --> 01:42:33,075
Bennie is smarter than I thought.

1950
01:42:33,090 --> 01:42:34,508
No, he's not smart at all.

1951
01:42:34,591 --> 01:42:36,969
The premiums on the swap
ate into his desk's profit.

1952
01:42:37,052 --> 01:42:39,012
To cover his BBB shorts,

1953
01:42:39,096 --> 01:42:41,598
he sold a lot of A
and AA swaps as protection.

1954
01:42:41,682 --> 01:42:42,683
A lot.

1955
01:42:43,392 --> 01:42:46,562
He believed that there was no way
that they could be affected.

1956
01:42:47,145 --> 01:42:50,482
Tell me Morgan Stanley doesn't hold
the contracts on these swaps.

1957
01:42:53,819 --> 01:42:55,320
Holy shit.

1958
01:42:55,988 --> 01:42:59,408
All this time I've been trying to figure out
who I'm betting against,

1959
01:42:59,658 --> 01:43:01,493
and it's Morgan Stanley.

1960
01:43:02,452 --> 01:43:03,787
Which is me.

1961
01:43:05,497 --> 01:43:07,833
What's your exposure? $3 billion?

1962
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:10,586
Please, don't tell me it's more than four.

1963
01:43:10,752 --> 01:43:12,392
I can't answer that. I can't answer that.

1964
01:43:12,462 --> 01:43:15,632
Yes, you can answer that,
because I walk in here

1965
01:43:15,716 --> 01:43:18,802
and people are crying in your hallway.

1966
01:43:19,177 --> 01:43:20,345
Kathy,

1967
01:43:20,846 --> 01:43:22,889
you bring me in to tell me
everything's fine,

1968
01:43:22,973 --> 01:43:24,182
and everything's not fine.

1969
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:26,727
What, what is happening?

1970
01:43:28,937 --> 01:43:31,106
The long exposure is...

1971
01:43:33,025 --> 01:43:34,526
...$15 billion.

1972
01:43:40,490 --> 01:43:41,617
Jesus!

1973
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:44,077
He kept saying defaults
over 8% were impossible.

1974
01:43:44,161 --> 01:43:45,162
Oh, my God.

1975
01:43:45,245 --> 01:43:46,805
That there would be a million homeless!

1976
01:43:47,914 --> 01:43:50,167
Yeah, but we have nothing
to do with Morgan Stanley.

1977
01:43:53,086 --> 01:43:54,212
Yeah...

1978
01:43:54,546 --> 01:43:56,381
Tell the bankruptcy court.

1979
01:43:56,632 --> 01:43:59,760
Morgan fails, all our accounts
go on their balance sheet.

1980
01:44:00,385 --> 01:44:02,012
It's just crazy.

1981
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:03,555
Morgan makes the sucker's bet

1982
01:44:03,639 --> 01:44:05,974
and we pay their fucking gambling debt?

1983
01:44:06,475 --> 01:44:08,977
Short the bank stocks. Then we wait.

1984
01:44:12,898 --> 01:44:14,900
Or we sell our swaps
when the market opens.

1985
01:44:16,652 --> 01:44:19,696
We get our bonuses,
our investors get their profits, we get...

1986
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:22,282
What, 30 cents on the dollar?
It's not bad.

1987
01:44:22,574 --> 01:44:24,076
We're three times that.

1988
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:25,942
Not if there's no market left
to sell them in.

1989
01:44:25,952 --> 01:44:27,871
Forget it. We're not giving
out any lifeboats.

1990
01:44:27,954 --> 01:44:30,332
If Morgan goes under,
we end up with nothing.

1991
01:44:30,415 --> 01:44:31,416
Vinnie.

1992
01:44:33,168 --> 01:44:36,338
Jesus, come on. I say when we sell.

1993
01:44:40,467 --> 01:44:45,222
Look, I get that this is personal for you,
but we have a fiduciary responsibility.

1994
01:44:45,305 --> 01:44:46,807
No. No, we don't.

1995
01:44:47,099 --> 01:44:49,267
Nobody's acting responsible.

1996
01:44:49,434 --> 01:44:52,187
Fuck responsibility. Are you kidding me?

1997
01:44:52,688 --> 01:44:54,773
The assholes at the big banks
will take...

1998
01:44:54,856 --> 01:44:55,972
You boys want any appetizers?

1999
01:44:55,982 --> 01:44:57,734
We're talking, please!

2000
01:44:58,485 --> 01:44:59,986
- Excuse us.
- Sorry.

2001
01:45:02,114 --> 01:45:04,908
We are going to wait,
and we are going to wait,

2002
01:45:05,033 --> 01:45:06,535
and we are going to wait

2003
01:45:06,702 --> 01:45:10,455
until they feel the pain,
until they start to bleed.

2004
01:45:10,789 --> 01:45:12,916
- That is what I want.
- But what about our clients

2005
01:45:12,999 --> 01:45:14,366
who've entrusted us with their savings...

2006
01:45:14,376 --> 01:45:15,544
I say when we sell.

2007
01:45:15,627 --> 01:45:16,670
This isn't about you.

2008
01:45:16,753 --> 01:45:18,078
This isn't about you
and your Upper East Side

2009
01:45:18,088 --> 01:45:19,287
- mahogany soapbox.
- Hey! Hey!

2010
01:45:19,297 --> 01:45:20,632
I say when we sell!

2011
01:45:22,217 --> 01:45:23,969
Whatever you say, Mark.

2012
01:45:30,684 --> 01:45:32,477
Dude, did you hear the news?

2013
01:45:34,312 --> 01:45:36,648
Okay. So, not only do
two mortgage hedge funds

2014
01:45:36,732 --> 01:45:38,525
<i>backed by Bear Stearns go belly up,</i>

2015
01:45:38,608 --> 01:45:41,737
but now there's a class-action lawsuit
against Bear.

2016
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:42,988
Holy shit!

2017
01:45:43,071 --> 01:45:45,574
Let's go! Push! Push!

2018
01:45:45,657 --> 01:45:47,149
So, what? Bear could
really collapse here.

2019
01:45:47,159 --> 01:45:49,025
- This is a risk we really shouldn't take.
<i>- Then what?</i>

2020
01:45:49,035 --> 01:45:51,037
<i>We bought 80% of our swaps at Bear.</i>

2021
01:45:51,121 --> 01:45:52,706
- We'd lose everything.
<i>- So what?</i>

2022
01:45:52,789 --> 01:45:54,207
- Hey, sir?
- One second!

2023
01:45:54,332 --> 01:45:55,292
That's my opinion.

2024
01:45:55,375 --> 01:45:57,909
We bought these fucking things.
We have no clue how to sell them.

2025
01:45:57,919 --> 01:45:59,359
I know. We have to get Ben to do it.

2026
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:01,496
I've been trying to call him and
he won't get back to me.

2027
01:46:01,506 --> 01:46:03,759
No. He's on vacation
with his wife's family.

2028
01:46:03,842 --> 01:46:05,010
They're in England.

2029
01:46:05,969 --> 01:46:06,970
What?

2030
01:46:14,686 --> 01:46:16,271
<i>- Hello, Ben. Hey.
- Guys?</i>

2031
01:46:16,354 --> 01:46:17,939
<i>Yeah, we're here. Can you hear us?</i>

2032
01:46:18,023 --> 01:46:19,524
<i>- Guys?
- Yeah, we got you.</i>

2033
01:46:19,691 --> 01:46:22,527
<i>Yeah. I hardly got
cell phone or Wi-Fi service.</i>

2034
01:46:23,653 --> 01:46:26,239
I'm trying to sell $200 million
worth of securities.

2035
01:46:26,573 --> 01:46:28,909
In a pub. It smells like sheep.

2036
01:46:29,201 --> 01:46:30,202
You can do this.

2037
01:46:30,327 --> 01:46:31,526
<i>I don't want to pressure you, Ben</i>

2038
01:46:31,536 --> 01:46:34,122
<i>but if you don't pull this off,
we lose everything.</i>

2039
01:46:34,372 --> 01:46:37,667
All right. Let's see what
Credit Suisse's appetite is.

2040
01:46:42,839 --> 01:46:44,007
This is Brownfield Fund.

2041
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:46,009
I want to unload
my credit default swaps.

2042
01:46:46,343 --> 01:46:47,886
<i>All right. What you got?</i>

2043
01:46:48,053 --> 01:46:49,721
Twenty AA tranches of A.B.S. CDOs.

2044
01:46:50,347 --> 01:46:52,724
<i>A.B.S.? Are these...
These are pretty bad?</i>

2045
01:46:52,891 --> 01:46:54,891
Absolutely. They're complete shit.

2046
01:46:55,185 --> 01:46:56,685
<i>What's your notional value?</i>

2047
01:46:56,770 --> 01:46:59,439
Face value is 205 million. Dollars.

2048
01:46:59,731 --> 01:47:02,317
<i>All right, we could, we could go to forty.</i>

2049
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:03,720
No. We want at least 100 million.

2050
01:47:03,777 --> 01:47:07,447
100 million? Who are you,
a drug dealer or a banker?

2051
01:47:07,572 --> 01:47:10,075
'Cause if you're a banker,
you can fuck right off!

2052
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:11,399
<i>I don't know if we can make a market.</i>

2053
01:47:11,409 --> 01:47:12,569
Just give me your best price?

2054
01:47:12,619 --> 01:47:15,163
Yeah. Chuck 100 million
in for me, mate.

2055
01:47:15,247 --> 01:47:16,498
<i>I think we're far apart.</i>

2056
01:47:16,998 --> 01:47:19,417
Look, if you don't want the deal,
you can just hang up.

2057
01:47:21,878 --> 01:47:23,421
That's what I thought.

2058
01:47:24,214 --> 01:47:26,214
- 90 million.
- <i>70.</i>

2059
01:47:27,551 --> 01:47:29,051
85.

2060
01:47:29,261 --> 01:47:31,221
<i>- 78.</i>
- 84.

2061
01:47:32,430 --> 01:47:34,432
<i>- 78.</i>
- 84.

2062
01:47:36,268 --> 01:47:37,561
It's Dr. Burry.

2063
01:47:38,144 --> 01:47:40,981
Looks like the collapse of the
financial sector is imminent.

2064
01:47:41,982 --> 01:47:43,942
Let's start to sell my position.

2065
01:47:44,317 --> 01:47:46,152
It's $1.3 billion.

2066
01:47:47,654 --> 01:47:49,489
Sure, I'll hold.

2067
01:48:13,305 --> 01:48:14,806
So, I was right.

2068
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:18,143
I took a rash of shit for two years, but

2069
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,478
I was right.

2070
01:48:20,812 --> 01:48:22,564
And everyone was wrong.

2071
01:48:23,481 --> 01:48:26,651
And, yeah, I got a bonus check
for it. Sue me.

2072
01:48:27,319 --> 01:48:28,403
You know?

2073
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:32,449
It's a lot of money. I get it.
I can feel you judging me.

2074
01:48:32,532 --> 01:48:33,825
That's palpable.

2075
01:48:34,534 --> 01:48:38,538
But, hey, I never said
I was the hero of this story.

2076
01:48:39,164 --> 01:48:41,708
Hey, Ben. How are we looking?

2077
01:48:42,918 --> 01:48:44,252
<i>Eight... on...</i>

2078
01:48:45,003 --> 01:48:46,338
Sorry?

2079
01:48:46,713 --> 01:48:48,840
No. Eighty million.

2080
01:48:49,049 --> 01:48:50,749
$80 million, $80 million,
that's good, right?

2081
01:48:50,759 --> 01:48:51,917
- Eighty is great.
- Is that good?

2082
01:48:51,927 --> 01:48:53,127
- Eighty is great, Ben.
- Okay.

2083
01:48:53,178 --> 01:48:55,513
Thank you. Thank you so much.

2084
01:48:55,847 --> 01:48:57,724
<i>Most of it went to UBS.</i>

2085
01:48:57,849 --> 01:48:59,601
<i>You're very lucky. The largest bank</i>

2086
01:48:59,684 --> 01:49:02,729
in France froze customer's
money market accounts today.

2087
01:49:02,812 --> 01:49:04,356
This thing's hitting Europe.

2088
01:49:04,439 --> 01:49:06,274
Greece and Iceland are finished.

2089
01:49:06,358 --> 01:49:07,692
Spain is teetering.

2090
01:49:07,776 --> 01:49:09,361
Are you serious? Fuck.

2091
01:49:09,778 --> 01:49:11,613
<i>Ben, call us when you get home.</i>

2092
01:49:11,696 --> 01:49:13,490
<i>But, hey, before you go,</i>

2093
01:49:13,573 --> 01:49:15,116
I'm just wondering...

2094
01:49:18,203 --> 01:49:20,246
Why did you do this with us?

2095
01:49:21,206 --> 01:49:23,208
<i>You didn't have to.</i>

2096
01:49:23,541 --> 01:49:27,212
<i>Thank you. But, why?</i>

2097
01:49:28,129 --> 01:49:31,049
You guys said you wanted to get rich.
Now you're rich.

2098
01:49:31,591 --> 01:49:32,676
<i>Goal!</i>

2099
01:49:32,759 --> 01:49:34,439
<i>Pamplona puts themselves
on the scoreboard.</i>

2100
01:49:38,556 --> 01:49:41,101
<i>As the housing markets and banks
continued to hemorrhage,</i>

2101
01:49:41,184 --> 01:49:43,603
<i>only one of the big shorts
refused to sell.</i>

2102
01:49:43,687 --> 01:49:44,896
<i>Mark Baum.</i>

2103
01:49:48,274 --> 01:49:50,318
<i>So it was beyond perfect
when he was asked to speak</i>

2104
01:49:50,402 --> 01:49:52,237
<i>at a conference opposite Bruce Miller,</i>

2105
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,781
<i>the famous bullish investor.</i>

2106
01:49:55,156 --> 01:49:57,367
<i>After he and Mark had their debate,
Alan Greenspan,</i>

2107
01:49:57,450 --> 01:50:00,912
<i>one of the architects of the whole crisis
was scheduled to speak.</i>

2108
01:50:01,162 --> 01:50:03,748
<i>Everyone in Mark's office showed up,
he even invited friends.</i>

2109
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:08,545
<i>This was the Ali vs. Foreman
of the financial world.</i>

2110
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:10,922
<i>The realist versus the fools.</i>

2111
01:50:11,381 --> 01:50:12,882
<i>And if it seems almost too perfect,</i>

2112
01:50:12,966 --> 01:50:14,968
<i>trust me, this happened.</i>

2113
01:50:19,431 --> 01:50:23,268
Welcome, everyone.
Please give a generous welcome to

2114
01:50:23,601 --> 01:50:27,188
Mr. Bruce Miller and Mark Baum.

2115
01:50:44,372 --> 01:50:45,874
Strap yourself in.

2116
01:50:47,125 --> 01:50:49,294
<i>So as some of you may know,
Bear Stearns</i>

2117
01:50:49,377 --> 01:50:51,963
has just received
a loan from JP Morgan.

2118
01:50:52,047 --> 01:50:54,883
Of course, we're gonna have to
wait and see how the markets react,

2119
01:50:54,966 --> 01:50:58,678
but that should lay to rest any concerns
about the bank's health.

2120
01:50:58,762 --> 01:51:03,475
Now, I take it you have no plans to sell
your $200 million in Bear stock?

2121
01:51:03,808 --> 01:51:05,508
No. As a matter of fact,
when we're done here,

2122
01:51:05,518 --> 01:51:07,312
I'll probably go out and buy some more.

2123
01:51:08,813 --> 01:51:12,317
For the opposing view, Mr. Baum.

2124
01:51:14,736 --> 01:51:16,821
I got to stand for this.

2125
01:51:19,574 --> 01:51:21,159
Okay, hi.

2126
01:51:21,576 --> 01:51:23,995
My firm's thesis is pretty simple.

2127
01:51:24,329 --> 01:51:26,164
Wall Street took a good idea,

2128
01:51:26,247 --> 01:51:27,749
Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bond,

2129
01:51:27,999 --> 01:51:30,251
and turned it into an atomic bomb

2130
01:51:30,335 --> 01:51:32,504
of fraud and stupidity

2131
01:51:32,837 --> 01:51:35,507
that's on its way to
decimating the world economy.

2132
01:51:35,590 --> 01:51:38,134
How do you really feel?

2133
01:51:38,259 --> 01:51:40,178
I'm glad you still have a sense of humor.

2134
01:51:40,261 --> 01:51:42,305
I wouldn't if I were you.

2135
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:46,726
Now, anyone who knows me knows that

2136
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:49,270
I have no problem telling
someone they're wrong.

2137
01:51:49,354 --> 01:51:52,816
Bear Stearns is denying
rumors of liquidity problems.

2138
01:51:53,525 --> 01:51:55,819
Holy fuck, it's 39 now!

2139
01:51:57,987 --> 01:52:00,532
We live in an era of fraud in America.

2140
01:52:00,615 --> 01:52:02,992
Not just in banking, but in government,

2141
01:52:03,451 --> 01:52:06,412
education, religion, food,

2142
01:52:06,496 --> 01:52:08,164
even baseball.

2143
01:52:08,665 --> 01:52:11,251
What bothers me isn't that

2144
01:52:11,876 --> 01:52:15,713
fraud is not nice or that fraud is mean.

2145
01:52:16,005 --> 01:52:17,882
It's that for 15,000 years

2146
01:52:18,716 --> 01:52:20,260
fraud and short-sighted thinking

2147
01:52:20,343 --> 01:52:22,720
have never, ever worked.

2148
01:52:22,846 --> 01:52:25,390
- Jesus, Bear at 37...
- Not once.

2149
01:52:25,807 --> 01:52:29,102
Eventually, people get caught,
things go south.

2150
01:52:29,185 --> 01:52:30,562
It's fucking plummeting, man.

2151
01:52:30,728 --> 01:52:33,022
When the hell did we forget all that?

2152
01:52:37,193 --> 01:52:39,696
I thought we were better than this.
I really did.

2153
01:52:40,029 --> 01:52:42,073
And the fact that we're not

2154
01:52:42,198 --> 01:52:44,909
doesn't make me feel
all right and superior.

2155
01:52:44,993 --> 01:52:47,495
It makes me feel... sad.

2156
01:52:47,912 --> 01:52:50,248
Every time I fucking hit
"refresh" it's dropping, man.

2157
01:52:51,916 --> 01:52:53,585
And as fun as it is to watch

2158
01:52:53,877 --> 01:52:56,171
pompous, dumb Wall Streeters
be wildly wrong,

2159
01:52:56,254 --> 01:52:58,548
and you are wrong, sir,

2160
01:52:59,382 --> 01:53:02,385
I just know, that at the end of the day

2161
01:53:03,052 --> 01:53:05,763
average people are going to be the ones

2162
01:53:05,889 --> 01:53:08,057
that are gonna have to pay for all this.

2163
01:53:08,725 --> 01:53:10,852
Because they always, always do.

2164
01:53:10,935 --> 01:53:11,936
It's 32.

2165
01:53:12,061 --> 01:53:13,438
It's fucking tanked, man.

2166
01:53:13,563 --> 01:53:15,565
That's my two cents. Thank you.

2167
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:18,234
Let me drop a deuce at Deutsche.

2168
01:53:18,401 --> 01:53:20,403
Does our bull have a response?

2169
01:53:21,404 --> 01:53:24,908
Only that, in the entire
history of Wall Street,

2170
01:53:25,033 --> 01:53:29,412
no investment bank has ever failed
unless caught in criminal activities.

2171
01:53:29,913 --> 01:53:33,416
So, yes, I stand by
my Bear Stearns optimism.

2172
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:35,752
Mr. Miller, I'm sorry. Quick question.

2173
01:53:36,252 --> 01:53:37,921
From the time you guys started talking,

2174
01:53:38,087 --> 01:53:40,965
Bear Stearns stock has
fallen more than 38%.

2175
01:53:41,049 --> 01:53:42,425
Would you still buy more?

2176
01:53:42,634 --> 01:53:46,763
Yeah, sure, of course
I'd buy more. Why not?

2177
01:53:47,222 --> 01:53:48,223
Boom.

2178
01:53:51,476 --> 01:53:52,810
Jesus Christ!

2179
01:53:54,270 --> 01:53:57,440
That concludes the first part
of our presentation.

2180
01:53:58,441 --> 01:54:03,071
Up next, we have the legendary
former chairman of the Fed,

2181
01:54:03,154 --> 01:54:04,948
Alan Greenspan.

2182
01:54:05,031 --> 01:54:06,366
Folks?

2183
01:54:24,676 --> 01:54:25,959
<i>...employees of Lehman Brothers today,</i>

2184
01:54:25,969 --> 01:54:29,305
<i>as the Wall Street giant's
stock went to zero.</i>

2185
01:54:29,639 --> 01:54:31,516
<i>The collapse of the venerable
New York bank</i>

2186
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:35,270
<i>follows a tumultuous few
months of market volatility</i>

2187
01:54:35,353 --> 01:54:37,981
<i>and fear in the world economy.</i>

2188
01:54:38,314 --> 01:54:40,024
I got to see inside.

2189
01:54:40,817 --> 01:54:42,151
How?

2190
01:54:42,860 --> 01:54:43,861
Come on.

2191
01:54:44,696 --> 01:54:47,782
I left my phone in the office.
I threw my pass out already.

2192
01:54:47,865 --> 01:54:49,284
<i>Do you mind if I take your pass?</i>

2193
01:54:49,367 --> 01:54:51,953
I don't give a shit anymore.
You can do what you want.

2194
01:54:59,836 --> 01:55:01,546
Go directly to your transportation.

2195
01:55:01,629 --> 01:55:03,339
Do not talk to the press.

2196
01:55:03,506 --> 01:55:06,843
After 18 years, I just leave?
That's just fucking great!

2197
01:55:07,051 --> 01:55:09,929
I'll talk to whoever the hell I want!

2198
01:55:10,013 --> 01:55:12,348
Do not talk to the press.

2199
01:55:12,682 --> 01:55:14,642
Go directly to your transportation.

2200
01:55:14,726 --> 01:55:15,810
Do not talk to...

2201
01:55:18,396 --> 01:55:19,679
Hey, look, you wanna get a bite tonight?

2202
01:55:19,689 --> 01:55:22,108
There's this new Cuban place

2203
01:55:22,191 --> 01:55:24,517
just opened on the Lower East Side.
It's supposed to be good.

2204
01:55:24,527 --> 01:55:26,195
- Really?
- Yeah.

2205
01:55:26,696 --> 01:55:28,031
You and I?

2206
01:55:28,239 --> 01:55:29,824
Yeah, or other people.

2207
01:55:29,907 --> 01:55:31,707
- That sounds nice. I would like that.
- Yeah.

2208
01:55:31,743 --> 01:55:33,036
Finally.

2209
01:55:33,411 --> 01:55:34,746
Mark, hey.

2210
01:55:35,038 --> 01:55:36,331
<i>It's a bloodbath up here.</i>

2211
01:55:36,414 --> 01:55:37,915
<i>Morgan stock has lost half its value.</i>

2212
01:55:37,999 --> 01:55:40,293
<i>It's down to 23.10. It's in freefall.</i>

2213
01:55:40,376 --> 01:55:43,379
<i>Clients want to talk to you
about pulling their money.</i>

2214
01:55:43,588 --> 01:55:47,091
<i>It's now or never, Mark. We got to sell.</i>

2215
01:55:50,386 --> 01:55:51,554
<i>Mark.</i>

2216
01:55:52,930 --> 01:55:54,098
<i>Mark, you hear me?</i>

2217
01:55:54,432 --> 01:55:55,892
<i>Mailbox one.</i>

2218
01:55:56,059 --> 01:55:58,770
<i>You have 15 messages.</i>

2219
01:56:00,229 --> 01:56:01,856
<i>Mike, I can't seem to get ahold of you.</i>

2220
01:56:01,939 --> 01:56:04,400
<i>Will you please call me
at your earliest convenience.</i>

2221
01:56:05,735 --> 01:56:08,571
<i>It's Jack. You're buying stocks?</i>

2222
01:56:08,780 --> 01:56:11,741
<i>The market's at an all-time low.
This is crazy!</i>

2223
01:56:11,991 --> 01:56:14,327
<i>I met my wife on Match.com.</i>

2224
01:56:14,744 --> 01:56:16,079
<i>My profile said,</i>

2225
01:56:16,287 --> 01:56:18,623
<i>"I am a medical student
with only one eye,"</i>

2226
01:56:18,706 --> 01:56:20,625
<i>"an awkward social manner,"</i>

2227
01:56:20,708 --> 01:56:24,295
<i>"and $145,000 in student loans."</i>

2228
01:56:24,962 --> 01:56:26,422
<i>She wrote back,</i>

2229
01:56:26,714 --> 01:56:28,354
<i>"You're just what I've been looking for."</i>

2230
01:56:29,258 --> 01:56:30,927
<i>She meant honest.</i>

2231
01:56:31,135 --> 01:56:32,804
<i>So let me be honest.</i>

2232
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:37,225
The housing crisis represents
the greatest financial opportunity of...

2233
01:56:37,308 --> 01:56:40,103
<i>Making money is not like
I thought it would be.</i>

2234
01:56:40,436 --> 01:56:45,024
<i>This business kills the part
of life that is essential.</i>

2235
01:56:45,108 --> 01:56:48,152
<i>The part that has
nothing to do with business.</i>

2236
01:56:50,446 --> 01:56:52,573
<i>For the past two years, my insides</i>

2237
01:56:53,616 --> 01:56:55,993
<i>have felt like they're eating themselves.</i>

2238
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:58,454
<i>All the people I respected</i>

2239
01:56:58,955 --> 01:57:01,457
<i>won't talk to me anymore</i>

2240
01:57:01,707 --> 01:57:03,543
<i>except through lawyers.</i>

2241
01:57:07,296 --> 01:57:08,673
<i>People</i>

2242
01:57:09,465 --> 01:57:12,051
<i>want an authority to tell them
how to value things...</i>

2243
01:57:12,135 --> 01:57:17,598
<i>...but they choose this authority
not based on facts or results.</i>

2244
01:57:19,058 --> 01:57:23,729
<i>They choose it because it seems
authoritative and familiar.</i>

2245
01:57:23,813 --> 01:57:26,274
<i>And I am not</i>

2246
01:57:26,357 --> 01:57:29,402
<i>and never have been "familiar".</i>

2247
01:57:31,362 --> 01:57:32,363
<i>So...</i>

2248
01:57:33,239 --> 01:57:36,367
<i>So, I've come to the sullen realization</i>

2249
01:57:36,451 --> 01:57:39,245
<i>that I must close down the fund.</i>

2250
01:57:39,328 --> 01:57:42,415
<i>Sincerely, Michael J. Burry, M.D.</i>

2251
01:58:42,141 --> 01:58:44,227
This isn't how I pictured it.

2252
01:58:46,229 --> 01:58:47,396
What did you think we'd find?

2253
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:48,523
I don't know.

2254
01:58:50,399 --> 01:58:51,901
Grownups.

2255
01:58:55,821 --> 01:58:57,323
Mark, you there?

2256
01:58:59,992 --> 01:59:01,244
<i>Mark?</i>

2257
01:59:01,494 --> 01:59:04,413
Paulson and Bernanke
just left the White House.

2258
01:59:09,752 --> 01:59:11,921
There's going to be a bailout.

2259
01:59:13,506 --> 01:59:16,926
<i>Well, they had to. Right?</i>

2260
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:19,690
<i>- Paper markets would've collapsed.</i>
- They knew.

2261
01:59:19,929 --> 01:59:21,509
<i>Cash would've stopped
coming out of ATMs.</i>

2262
01:59:21,514 --> 01:59:23,057
<i>They had to backstop this.</i>

2263
01:59:23,349 --> 01:59:25,685
They knew the taxpayers
would bail them out.

2264
01:59:25,768 --> 01:59:28,187
They weren't being stupid.
They just didn't care.

2265
01:59:28,354 --> 01:59:30,523
<i>Yeah. 'Cause they're fucking crooks.</i>

2266
01:59:32,441 --> 01:59:34,986
But at least we're going to
see some of them go to jail.

2267
01:59:36,195 --> 01:59:39,448
Right? I mean, they're gonna
have to break up the banks.

2268
01:59:40,533 --> 01:59:41,867
<i>I mean, the party's over.</i>

2269
01:59:41,951 --> 01:59:44,620
I don't know. I don't know, Vinnie.

2270
01:59:47,373 --> 01:59:48,874
I have a feeling

2271
01:59:48,958 --> 01:59:50,835
that in a few years people
are gonna be doing

2272
01:59:50,918 --> 01:59:53,921
what they always do
when the economy tanks.

2273
01:59:54,380 --> 01:59:57,592
They will be blaming
immigrants and poor people.

2274
01:59:57,883 --> 01:59:59,218
<i>But Mark was wrong.</i>

2275
02:00:00,344 --> 02:00:02,305
<i>In the years that followed,
hundreds of bankers</i>

2276
02:00:02,388 --> 02:00:05,016
<i>and rating agencies executives
went to jail.</i>

2277
02:00:05,182 --> 02:00:07,226
<i>The SEC was completely overhauled.</i>

2278
02:00:07,393 --> 02:00:10,104
<i>And Congress had no choice
but to break up the big banks</i>

2279
02:00:10,521 --> 02:00:12,982
<i>and regulate the mortgage
and derivatives industries.</i>

2280
02:00:17,778 --> 02:00:19,113
<i>Just kidding.</i>

2281
02:00:19,363 --> 02:00:21,574
<i>The banks took the money
the American people gave them</i>

2282
02:00:21,657 --> 02:00:23,951
<i>and used it to pay themselves
huge bonuses</i>

2283
02:00:24,035 --> 02:00:26,287
<i>and lobby Congress to kill big reform.</i>

2284
02:00:26,454 --> 02:00:28,706
<i>And then they blamed
immigrants and poor people.</i>

2285
02:00:28,789 --> 02:00:30,958
<i>And this time, even teachers.</i>

2286
02:00:32,335 --> 02:00:35,379
<i>And when all was said and done,
only one single banker went to jail.</i>

2287
02:00:36,297 --> 02:00:37,423
<i>This poor schmuck.</i>

2288
02:00:37,506 --> 02:00:39,967
<i>Kareem Serageldin from Credit Suisse.</i>

2289
02:00:40,301 --> 02:00:42,637
<i>He hid a few billion
in mortgage bond losses,</i>

2290
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:45,973
<i>something most of the big banks did
on a good day during the crisis.</i>

2291
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:49,602
Mark, can we sell now?

2292
02:00:51,270 --> 02:00:53,898
<i>The fund will make almost $1 billion.</i>

2293
02:00:53,981 --> 02:00:55,608
<i>You'll clear $200 mil, Mark.</i>

2294
02:00:56,776 --> 02:00:59,028
You know, once we sell,

2295
02:00:59,779 --> 02:01:01,656
we'll be just like the rest of them.

2296
02:01:01,739 --> 02:01:02,865
You know that.

2297
02:01:03,199 --> 02:01:04,857
<i>No, we're not.
We're not the bad guys here.</i>

2298
02:01:04,867 --> 02:01:08,371
<i>We didn't defraud the American people
and prey on their dreams</i>

2299
02:01:08,454 --> 02:01:10,039
<i>of owning a home.
All right?</i>

2300
02:01:10,122 --> 02:01:11,415
<i>They did.</i>

2301
02:01:12,416 --> 02:01:14,710
And now we get to kick them
in the teeth.

2302
02:01:19,799 --> 02:01:21,801
A billion dollars.

2303
02:01:23,469 --> 02:01:24,720
<i>That's right.</i>

2304
02:01:24,804 --> 02:01:27,640
<i>But we got to close out our
position or it could be zero.</i>

2305
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:30,976
<i>I mean, it's now or never, Mark.</i>

2306
02:01:40,152 --> 02:01:41,570
Okay.

2307
02:01:45,324 --> 02:01:46,742
Sell it all.
