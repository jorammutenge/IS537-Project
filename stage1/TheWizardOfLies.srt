00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:29,240
<i>My name is Diana Henriques.</i>

3
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:32,827
<i>As an investigating reporter
for the "New York Times,"</i>

4
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:35,747
<i>I had been covering the Bernie Madoff scandal...</i>

5
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,165
<i>...from the day it began.</i>

6
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:42,086
<i>After months of requests
and correspondence,</i>

7
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:45,757
<i>I was finally able to sit down
and interview Bernie Madoff...</i>

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,425
<i>...on August 24th, 2010.</i>

9
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:51,470
<i>Until today,</i>

10
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:54,098
<i>...his only visitor,
apart from lawyers...</i>

11
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:56,642
<i>...has been his wife.</i>

12
00:00:56,686 --> 00:00:59,854
<i>He has not answered
any independent questions...</i>

13
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:01,314
<i>...about his crime...</i>

14
00:01:01,357 --> 00:01:03,608
<i>...except when standing
in a courtroom...</i>

15
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:04,983
<i>...responding to a judge.</i>

16
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:08,278
<i>On those occasions,</i>

17
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:11,783
<i>...he seemed stiff,
almost rehearsed.</i>

18
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:13,450
<i>But in our conversation,</i>

19
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:15,578
<i>...he seemed relaxed,</i>

20
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:17,412
<i>...unfailingly candid,</i>

21
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:20,667
<i>...earnest, and trustworthy.</i>

22
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:23,586
<i>That is his talent
and his curse.</i>

23
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:27,048
<i>That is what enabled him...</i>

24
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:29,634
<i>...to pull off the biggest Ponzi scheme on record.</i>

25
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:33,471
<i>$65 billion.</i>

26
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:38,268
<i>Bernard L. Madoff...</i>

27
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:43,438
<i>...inmate number 61727054.</i>

28
00:01:53,117 --> 00:01:54,720
<i>In overseas trading today,</i>

29
00:01:54,744 --> 00:01:56,911
<i>...the Nikkei was down over 8%...</i>

30
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:59,705
<i>...with Australia's benchmark not far behind.</i>

31
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:01,833
<i>The crisis shows no sign of ending...</i>

32
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:04,751
<i>...as DOW futures are down
this morning on Wall Street...</i>

33
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:07,129
<i>...and Main Street continues to find itself...</i>

34
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:09,716
- <i>...in the crosshairs of the largest meltdown...</i>
- Shit.

35
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,550
<i>Since the Great Depression.</i>

36
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:13,970
<i>Investors and banks are holding onto their cash...</i>

37
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:17,306
<i>...until more certainty can be
flushed into financial markets.</i>

38
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,434
<i>Let's go now to Bob Summers...</i>

39
00:02:19,477 --> 00:02:21,644
<i>...with a story on yet another city...</i>

40
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:24,187
<i>...going under
from the mortgage crisis.</i>

41
00:02:24,232 --> 00:02:26,858
<i>I'm in Fresno, California,
where if you look around...</i>

42
00:02:32,657 --> 00:02:34,364
Just let me lead it off.

43
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:36,575
It's completely fucking crazy.

44
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,578
We can't back down on this one, Andy.

45
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:40,705
We're not gonna back down.
We're gonna hold firm.

46
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:42,748
What, no good mornings,
no hellos?

47
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,208
Dad?

48
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:49,379
What's going on?

49
00:02:49,424 --> 00:02:51,758
You're giving out
175 mil in bonuses?

50
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,092
- I am.
- In December?

51
00:02:53,135 --> 00:02:55,345
We've had a very strong year.

52
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:57,338
The year's not over.
We don't know where we're gonna land.

53
00:02:57,348 --> 00:02:59,181
I wanna reward people.

54
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:01,051
I want them to feel good about
the work they've done here.

55
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,227
There's a reason that the
bonuses go out in February,

56
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,478
...especially in this climate.

57
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:06,647
You're not hearing me.

58
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:08,974
It's important that people can
take care of their families.

59
00:03:08,984 --> 00:03:10,484
Isn't it better to play it safe?

60
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:12,946
Hang on to any windfall just in case?

61
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,031
I'm paying out the bonuses now.

62
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:17,199
<i>But that's crazy. It doesn't make any sense.</i>

63
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,580
- Peter.
- Bernie, come on.

64
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:25,333
This isn't a fucking debate.

65
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,377
I'm paying out the bonuses now.

66
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,379
I'm taking care of everybody.

67
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:31,798
Dad, are you all right?

68
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,675
What's going on with you?

69
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:36,426
I'm okay.

70
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:38,304
<i>Okay, are you sure?</i>

71
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:40,890
<i>Bernie, just tell them.</i>

72
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:42,599
<i>Tell us what?</i>

73
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:47,688
What is it, Dad?
What's going on?

74
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,071
<i>What is it, Dad?</i>

75
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,992
I have to talk to you.

76
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:02,203
<i>You can. You know you can.</i>

77
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:04,079
I know.

78
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:14,549
Fucking fish bowl here.

79
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:19,052
Fucking fish bowl.

80
00:04:19,097 --> 00:04:20,595
Huh?

81
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:24,183
Everybody can see everything in here.

82
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:27,561
How come we never got fucking blinds?

83
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:32,025
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Ruth.</i>

84
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:33,601
- <i>Hi.
- The boys and I are heading home.</i>

85
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:35,193
<i>Why?</i>

86
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:37,280
<i>I have to talk to you all.</i>

87
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:39,282
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

88
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:41,616
<i>- Yeah, we'll be home soon.
- All right.</i>

89
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:51,626
Is it your health?

90
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:55,922
No.

91
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:22,157
Let's go in the study downstairs.

92
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:35,212
<i>There's no way to... to say it.</i>

93
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:39,592
<i>None of it is real.</i>

94
00:05:39,635 --> 00:05:41,551
<i>It's all one big fucking lie.</i>

95
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:44,179
- What is?
- The advisory.

96
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:45,681
It's a fraud.

97
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:47,849
<i>There are no investments.</i>

98
00:05:47,893 --> 00:05:50,178
What are you talking about?
Of course there are investments.

99
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:52,938
- I made them up.
- They're on every statement.

100
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:56,025
- I ma... I made them up.
- I've seen the trades.

101
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:57,193
<i>They're fake.</i>

102
00:05:58,321 --> 00:05:59,778
It's all fake.

103
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:02,030
Basically, just a big Ponzi scheme.

104
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:06,910
What's a Ponzi scheme?

105
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:08,453
I took money from some people.

106
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:09,871
I gave it to others and I never...

107
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,498
...there's nothing left.

108
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:14,460
<i>There's supposed to be 50 billion.</i>

109
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:16,419
There's absolutely nothing.

110
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,714
It's all gone.
I spoke to Peter...

111
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:21,092
<i>...I told him I'm gonna
turn myself in next week.</i>

112
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:26,847
How could you do this?

113
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,059
- I just couldn't stop...
<i>- Bullshit.</i>

114
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:32,803
It got bigger and bigger
and it just wouldn't stop.

115
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:35,272
Bullshit.

116
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:38,316
- I didn't mean for it to get like this.
- No, no, no, no.

117
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,277
You can't do this.
I'm your son.

118
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:43,823
Dad. Dad, how could you do this?

119
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,366
<i>I'm gonna set you guys up.</i>

120
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,826
Yeah. It's... it's all gonna be okay.

121
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:50,705
There's still
a few hundred million left.

122
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:52,289
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna make sure...

123
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,417
...that you guys are all taken care of,

124
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,544
<i>...the rest of the family,
some loyal employees.</i>

125
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,964
It's all gonna be good.
I just need a week.

126
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:04,176
<i>Set us up with what?</i>

127
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,554
<i>With stolen money?</i>

128
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:08,472
<i>He's a criminal.</i>

129
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,683
<i>He's gonna spend his life in jail.</i>

130
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:13,287
<i>- Dad, how could you do this?
- You're not my father.</i>

131
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:22,527
I explained to them that
it wasn't malicious,

132
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:24,739
...that when I started this problem...

133
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:27,325
...or this crime...

134
00:07:27,368 --> 00:07:28,902
...that is was something that I thought

135
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:30,828
I would be able to work my way out of.

136
00:07:30,871 --> 00:07:34,123
But that became impossible.

137
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:37,919
The harder I tried, the deeper
I dug myself into a hole.

138
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:43,715
But it comes down to one thing.

139
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,135
I refused to accept the fact,

140
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:47,595
...could not accept the fact...

141
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,429
...that for once in my life I had failed.

142
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:52,265
I couldn't...
I couldn't admit that failure.

143
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,479
And what was that failure?

144
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:04,820
Shortly thereafter, I...

145
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:09,241
...I think I went back to the office.

146
00:08:09,284 --> 00:08:11,785
Andy was there.
I saw Andy.

147
00:08:11,828 --> 00:08:13,703
Did you two speak?

148
00:08:13,748 --> 00:08:15,914
He did mention that...

149
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,083
...that he, uh...

150
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:20,835
...he and Mark were consulting with a lawyer.

151
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,424
<i>Well, as it turned out,
he went to see Martin London...</i>

152
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,592
<i>...much honored lawyer, retired.</i>

153
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:30,095
<i>- He's Mark's father-in-law.
- Yes.</i>

154
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:32,974
<i>He'd invested a substantial
amount of money with you, right?</i>

155
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:35,685
<i>Well, more than some, less than others.</i>

156
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,479
Jesus fucking Christ.

157
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:40,897
50 million?

158
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:43,859
50 billion,
with a "B."

159
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:46,903
Jesus fucking Christ.

160
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:48,364
All right, I'm in Hartford.

161
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:50,157
I'll be there at 3:00 PM.

162
00:08:51,869 --> 00:08:54,787
You have to understand
the money management business...

163
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,663
...was operating from a small office.

164
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,740
- Yeah, the office is on a separate floor.
- The 17th floor.

165
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,701
- It's always seemed successful.
- A ton of clients, I think.

166
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:03,170
- Hedge funds.
- I know he'd even turn people away sometimes.

167
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:05,831
- But all the trades...
- Yeah, the trades go through European counterparties.

168
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:07,716
That's why he has the London office.

169
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,926
And then upstairs on the
19th floor is market making.

170
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,971
- Which is where we work.
- These are not my immediate concerns.

171
00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:16,099
But if he plans to spend the week...

172
00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:19,353
...distributing his ill-gotten gains...

173
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:21,272
...amongst his relatives,

174
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:23,231
...employees, his friends,

175
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,151
<i>...then this is not over.</i>

176
00:09:25,194 --> 00:09:27,862
This is a crime in progress.

177
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:31,114
So what are you saying?
We have to turn him in?

178
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:33,575
You don't turn him in.
You're an accomplice.

179
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:48,798
Yeah?

180
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,802
Okay, it's all fine.

181
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:54,263
Yep.

182
00:09:57,976 --> 00:09:59,435
<i>Who is it?</i>

183
00:10:00,562 --> 00:10:02,229
<i>The FBI is here.</i>

184
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,320
I know why you're here.

185
00:10:09,364 --> 00:10:11,029
Well, we're here to find out...

186
00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:12,907
...if there's an innocent explanation.

187
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:18,287
There is no innocent explanation.

188
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,249
Is there someplace we can talk, privately?

189
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:24,835
In there.

190
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:32,970
<i>He said he'd been operating a Ponzi scheme</i>

191
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:34,637
<i>...since the 1970s.</i>

192
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:39,349
<i>He was so matter-of-fact about it.</i>

193
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:41,685
<i>He wasn't nervous,
he wasn't afraid.</i>

194
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:43,854
<i>He was just very casual.</i>

195
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:46,731
<i>Well, sir, he claims to have acted alone.</i>

196
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,149
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

197
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:49,652
I'll bring him in.

198
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:56,825
Hi, it's Ruth.

199
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:58,160
Are the boys there?

200
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:01,872
<i>They're not there.</i>

201
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:05,500
He won't be coming in today.

202
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:11,215
Sir, you're gonna have to remove your belt,

203
00:11:11,258 --> 00:11:12,841
...your shoelaces, your tie,

204
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:14,343
...and any jewelry.

205
00:11:21,643 --> 00:11:22,851
<i>- This?
- Yep.</i>

206
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:24,854
<i>Credit card, cash,</i>

207
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:26,354
<i>...anything in your pockets, sir.</i>

208
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:02,391
Turn around, please, sir.

209
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:07,104
<i>Hands behind your back.</i>

210
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:08,564
<i>Palms together.</i>

211
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:19,992
Put that stuff away.

212
00:12:20,036 --> 00:12:21,701
And call Ike Sorkin.

213
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:47,978
<i>What happened on the night of December 9, 2008?</i>

214
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:49,522
<i>My brother told me...</i>

215
00:12:49,565 --> 00:12:51,941
...that his investment advisory business...

216
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:53,776
...was a Ponzi scheme.

217
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:56,195
And what was your reaction
to hearing that Mr. Madoff...

218
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,113
...was operating a Ponzi scheme?

219
00:12:58,157 --> 00:13:00,657
Well, I was in total shock.

220
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,803
<i>In your first interview with the government,</i>

221
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:04,744
<i>...you stated that you idolized your brother.</i>

222
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:06,767
<i>- Is that correct?
- Yes, and that's correct.</i>

223
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,748
<i>Why did you idolize your brother?</i>

224
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:12,127
<i>Well, because he was brilliant.</i>

225
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:14,922
<i>Everywhere you go,
people talked about Bernie.</i>

226
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:16,840
<i>He was a true pioneer.</i>

227
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,676
<i>Everyone in the industry,</i>

228
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,220
<i>...including the highest-ranking
officials at the SEC,</i>

229
00:13:21,263 --> 00:13:23,096
<i>...believed that my brother was</i>

230
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:27,268
...one of the most honorable
and successful traders...

231
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:29,228
...of our time.

232
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:31,647
Nobody believed that more than I did.

233
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:33,983
I revered him.

234
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:39,321
<i>I trusted him... implicitly.</i>

235
00:13:41,658 --> 00:13:43,700
- <i>Sorkin.</i>
- Ike, it's Bernie.

236
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:46,829
Uh, I'm down at FBI headquarters...

237
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:48,580
...handcuffed to a wall.

238
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:50,791
<i>Bernie, don't say another word.</i>

239
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:54,128
We arrested him this morning.

240
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:55,837
Was he okay?

241
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:57,631
I put the cuffs on him myself.

242
00:13:57,675 --> 00:13:59,550
He went quietly as though he expected us.

243
00:14:01,262 --> 00:14:03,012
<i>To be honest,</i>

244
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:04,805
<i>...he looked relieved.</i>

245
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:09,018
<i>You did the right thing, son.</i>

246
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,365
<i>Turn to the right.</i>

247
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,331
Yeah, the FBI just processed him...

248
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:34,084
...and they transferred him over to Pearl Street.

249
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:36,295
Yeah, we're heading in right now.

250
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,881
<i>So you were making money off of the trades.</i>

251
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:42,258
There were no trades.

252
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:44,677
- What do you mean there were no trades?
- I made them up.

253
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:48,098
- Weren't there statements?
- <i>Every month, they were fake.</i>

254
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:50,643
Purchase dates, they were fake;

255
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:52,978
Shares, they were fake;
Options, they were fake;

256
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:54,479
<i>Returns, they were fake.</i>

257
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:57,398
So when was the last trade you executed?

258
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,027
15 years ago.

259
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:05,074
<i>Who else knew?</i>

260
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:06,742
I acted alone.

261
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,747
<i>When did he tell you he started this Ponzi scheme?</i>

262
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,748
He didn't.

263
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:16,793
<i>And the entire time he was
running it, you had no idea?</i>

264
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:19,754
- No, I didn't.
<i>- And what was your role at the firm?</i>

265
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:23,591
<i>I ran the firm's NASDAQ desk in the late '90s,</i>

266
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:27,012
...added the rest of the
market-making desk in 2001,

267
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:29,848
...and moved to the proprietary
trading desk in 2003...

268
00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:31,767
You're not answering my question.

269
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:33,351
What exactly is your role at the firm?

270
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:35,144
<i>I'm only in the office a few days a week.</i>

271
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:37,815
I've been building a separate
business called Madoff Energy...

272
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:40,609
Sir, what is your exact title at BLM?

273
00:15:41,903 --> 00:15:45,029
Director of Proprietary Trading...

274
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:48,157
...and Codirector of Trading.

275
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:51,787
And where did the money for these loans come from?

276
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,081
The loans that allowed you
to buy your loft in SOHO,

277
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,252
...your house in Greenwich,
your house in Nantucket.

278
00:15:58,295 --> 00:16:01,463
I assume from the money he
made through investments.

279
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:03,340
<i>On the private advisory side?</i>

280
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:05,426
- Yes.
- <i>On the 17th floor?</i>

281
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:09,846
- Yes.
- And you never asked what went on the 17th floor?

282
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:11,473
Of course I did.

283
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:14,308
- <i>You did?</i>
- Yes.

284
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:16,894
- But...
- But what?

285
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:19,480
He would always say,

286
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:22,109
"You run your business
and I'll run my business."

287
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:23,694
And you never thought...

288
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:27,029
...to follow up on those questions?

289
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:29,450
- You don't understand...
- You're right, I don't.

290
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:31,285
I don't understand...

291
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:34,370
...how you could work in the
same office as your father...

292
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:37,541
...for 20 years and suspect nothing.

293
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:40,418
<i>Nothing?</i>

294
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:42,421
<i>Who are some of your father's clients?</i>

295
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:45,047
<i>I'm not privy to all of them,</i>

296
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:50,763
...but, um,
Jeffry Picower was a big one.

297
00:16:50,806 --> 00:16:52,931
Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz of the Mets.

298
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:55,893
<i>HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland,</i>

299
00:16:55,936 --> 00:16:59,396
...some family friends, Marty.

300
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,441
<i>But he wouldn't talk about
who or what he did for them.</i>

301
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:07,362
Our money was with him as well.

302
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:10,990
<i>So you were never suspicious of your father?</i>

303
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:12,534
Never?

304
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:14,495
Do you not understand who he was?

305
00:17:14,537 --> 00:17:16,029
I think we're all beginning to understand...

306
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,748
...exactly who your father is, Mr. Madoff.

307
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,499
He wasn't just my father.

308
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:23,170
You know, he was fucking idolized.

309
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:25,172
We're talking about a man...

310
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:27,298
...who created the modern market as we know it.

311
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:29,593
He created NASDAQ.

312
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:31,970
He's Chairman of NASDAQ.

313
00:17:32,014 --> 00:17:34,681
<i>He's Chairman of the National
Securities Clearing Corporation,</i>

314
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:37,726
<i>Chairman of the International
Securities Clearing Corporation,</i>

315
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:40,312
Chairman of the National
Association of Securities Dealers,

316
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:42,480
...which was FINRA before FINRA fucking existed.

317
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:44,900
Chairman of the SIA Trading Committee.

318
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:47,228
- Okay, we understand your point, sir...
- <i>No, I don't think you do.</i>

319
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:49,613
<i>Chairman of the National
Business Conduct Committee.</i>

320
00:17:49,656 --> 00:17:52,190
- Sir, we understand.
- Member of the SIA Federal Regulation Committee.

321
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,494
- Sir, that's enough.
- Chairman of the NASD Small Order Execution Committee.

322
00:17:55,537 --> 00:17:58,079
I mean, you're asking me...
how I didn't know.

323
00:17:58,123 --> 00:18:01,208
Well, I'm asking you.

324
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:04,670
You're the FBI,
you're the SEC.

325
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:05,921
You investigated him before,

326
00:18:05,964 --> 00:18:09,298
...so I'm... I'm asking you...

327
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:11,634
...how the fuck did you not know?!

328
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,514
Sir, we are not the focus here.
You are.

329
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:17,598
You're saying that you never stepped foot...

330
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:19,058
...on the 17th floor?

331
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:22,604
No.

<i>...for Bernie Madoff?</i>

349
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:13,572
I was 19 years old.

350
00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:16,033
<i>In what capacity had you known him?</i>

351
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:20,202
Oh, well, he was my boss.

352
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:23,873
<i>What type of work had you done
for him over the years?</i>

353
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:26,043
Uh, really anything he asked me to.

354
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:27,885
Everything from, you know, running errands...

355
00:19:27,922 --> 00:19:30,838
...to running his investment advisory department.

356
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:34,217
<i>Did you know why the FBI was
at Peter Madoff's office?</i>

357
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,470
Yes, I did.

358
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:40,097
<i>And what did that mean to you?</i>

359
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:42,351
Uh, it meant that I was going to jail.

360
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:47,271
<i>Why did you think you were going to jail?</i>

361
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:49,794
<i>Because I was well aware of
the nature of the operation.</i>

362
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:53,653
<i>And what was the nature of the operation?</i>

363
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:56,530
It was a fraud...

364
00:19:57,534 --> 00:19:59,116
...simply put.

365
00:20:00,828 --> 00:20:03,246
<i>I always thought that Bernie...</i>

366
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,457
<i>...would be able to make it good, you know?</i>

367
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,200
<i>He had money here, he had money there,
he moved stuff around.</i>

368
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,744
<i>There was always a lot of moving parts.</i>

369
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:11,837
<i>Maybe I was lying to myself.</i>

370
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:13,673
<i>I don't know,
but I... I thought he...</i>

371
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:15,508
<i>I thought he could cover it.</i>

372
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:19,887
What the hell is this?

373
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:22,598
Bernie's been arrested for securities fraud.

374
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:24,351
The SEC's getting a court order...

375
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:26,060
...to seize control and shut us down.

376
00:20:26,104 --> 00:20:27,645
Without an investigation?

377
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,939
What could they possibly know?

378
00:20:28,982 --> 00:20:31,191
Whatever Bernie told them.

379
00:20:34,153 --> 00:20:36,654
Sir, who was that gentleman?

380
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:39,074
He's... uh, he works here.

381
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:42,786
- Where?
- Uh, on the 17th floor.

382
00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:44,912
There's a 17th floor?

383
00:20:57,803 --> 00:21:01,179
Annette, Bernie's been
arrested for securities fraud.

384
00:21:01,222 --> 00:21:03,765
The SEC and the FBI are upstairs right now.

385
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:05,307
What?

386
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:07,227
The hell does that mean?

387
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:12,941
We need your keycard, ma'am.

388
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,866
Come on, come on, come on.

389
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,243
<i>Please, please.
Come on, come on, come on.</i>

390
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,915
<i>Open it.</i>

391
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,420
FBI! Everyone stop what what you're doing!

392
00:21:33,463 --> 00:21:37,673
FBI! I said stop what you're doing right now.

393
00:21:37,718 --> 00:21:40,177
<i>Move away from the computer!</i>

394
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,596
Sir, FBI. Do not touch that computer.

395
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,098
<i>I said move away from the computer!</i>

396
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:50,854
<i>Hey, Dan, walk this group out.</i>

397
00:21:56,361 --> 00:21:59,237
<i>The advisory was a completely separate business,</i>

398
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,864
<i>...a completely separate entity.</i>

399
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:03,909
<i>Never the two should meet, ever,</i>

400
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:05,493
<i>...and they didn't.</i>

401
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:07,996
<i>And I made it that way on purpose, obviously.</i>

402
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,748
<i>What about your brother? Peter's in trouble.</i>

403
00:22:10,793 --> 00:22:14,710
<i>- Yes.
- Because he trusted you. He did what you told him to.</i>

404
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:19,341
- He did.
- <i>And you told him to do things that exposed him...</i>

405
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:21,927
<i>...to this criminal liability
he's facing right now.</i>

406
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,762
How did you...
justify that, Bernie?

407
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:28,557
How did you...
sleep with that?

408
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:30,602
I guess the way I could sleep with it...

409
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:32,770
...is that I knew that
Peter didn't know anything...

410
00:22:32,815 --> 00:22:34,730
...even though I had him do things...

411
00:22:34,775 --> 00:22:36,775
...which he didn't realize

412
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:39,693
...could've implicated him in this...

413
00:22:39,738 --> 00:22:41,738
...in this, um...

414
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:44,990
...crime.

415
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:50,663
<i>Bernie was always needling people.</i>

416
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:53,708
He would find your weak spot
and he would poke at it.

417
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:57,045
I mean, that was Bernie and
he could be a real bastard.

418
00:22:57,088 --> 00:22:58,672
But not like this.

419
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:01,298
<i>I mean, not stealing
people's money.</i>

420
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:03,634
I mean, at first,
I started thinking,

421
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,971
"My God, you know, did one of the
grandchildren get kidnapped?"

422
00:23:07,015 --> 00:23:09,223
"Was the 10 million
ransom money?"

423
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:11,351
What 10 million?

424
00:23:11,394 --> 00:23:13,979
The 10 million that Ruth came in...

425
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:17,524
...and withdrew
from her Cohmad account

426
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:21,027
...and transferred into her Wachovia account.

427
00:23:22,197 --> 00:23:24,322
I mean, I...
what do I know?

428
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:26,825
I mean, I'm always watching
crime stories, you know?

429
00:23:26,868 --> 00:23:30,077
I fall asleep every night to "SVU."

430
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:31,787
And you're saying on December 10th,

431
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:35,166
Ruth Madoff withdrew $10 million
from her Cohmad account...

432
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,169
...and transferred it to a personal account?

433
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:39,171
Yes, but that is not unusual.

434
00:23:39,213 --> 00:23:41,839
I mean, think of it like having an ATM

435
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:43,633
...in your, you know... your living room.

436
00:23:43,677 --> 00:23:45,552
Except, you know,
when things are going on,

437
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:46,760
...you wonder.

438
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:54,768
<i>Mommy's here!</i>

439
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:57,898
<i>Don't forget your ball.</i>

440
00:23:57,941 --> 00:24:00,482
We're gonna go to Connecticut for a few days.

441
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:02,152
You know it might snow?

442
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:04,988
No mention of his arrest yet.

443
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:13,704
- It's my mom.
- <i>Don't answer.</i>

444
00:24:13,748 --> 00:24:15,414
You know what Flumenbaum said...

445
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:17,334
...no contact.

446
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:19,126
Don't screw around, Mark.

447
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:25,674
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mark.

448
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:28,345
Honey, I'm, um... I'm with your father...

449
00:24:28,387 --> 00:24:30,305
...and in order to release him on bond...

450
00:24:30,348 --> 00:24:32,598
...they need four signatures.

451
00:24:32,643 --> 00:24:34,768
It's a $10 million bond.

452
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,520
- What?
- <i>Ugh, I know. Can you believe?</i>

453
00:24:38,565 --> 00:24:40,148
Anyway, can you get down here?

454
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:42,066
Uh, I'll text you the address.

455
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,402
Mom,

456
00:24:44,445 --> 00:24:46,613
...do you understand what he's done?

457
00:24:46,656 --> 00:24:48,949
No, honey, Mark,
I know you're angry,

458
00:24:48,991 --> 00:24:50,408
...but he's your father.

459
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:52,994
I'm not doing it.
End of discussion.

460
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:56,373
<i>Mark.</i>

461
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:06,173
I'll try Andy.

462
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:12,889
What do you mean by misunderstanding?

463
00:25:12,932 --> 00:25:15,683
We couldn't get your sons to sign.

464
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:17,643
They wouldn't sign?

465
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:19,688
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Madoff.</i>

466
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,065
The boys wouldn't sign the bond?

467
00:25:22,108 --> 00:25:24,276
I'm very sorry, sir.

468
00:25:24,318 --> 00:25:26,527
Who... did you talk to them or did...

469
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,313
<i>No. Your wife was on the phone with each of them.</i>

470
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:30,403
Their mother did and they didn't...
they wouldn't...

471
00:25:31,785 --> 00:25:33,535
<i>Um...</i>

472
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:36,871
Well, there's no money involved in it.

473
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:39,082
So did they understand that?

474
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,916
Yes.

475
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:44,379
Hmm, I don't know.

476
00:25:47,758 --> 00:25:49,633
Marc, it's Daniel Horwitz.

477
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:51,845
<i>We couldn't get the four signatures,</i>

478
00:25:51,887 --> 00:25:53,430
<i>...but I can get you Ruth...</i>

479
00:25:53,472 --> 00:25:55,723
<i>...and, um, Peter Madoff's.</i>

480
00:25:57,268 --> 00:25:59,268
<i>Okay, hold on.</i>

481
00:25:59,313 --> 00:26:02,354
Will you submit to, um,
home detention...

482
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:05,107
...with electronic monitoring and surveillance,

483
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:08,777
<i>...homes in Manhattan, Montauk, and
Palm Beach will be pledged,</i>

484
00:26:08,822 --> 00:26:11,448
<i>...and yours and Ruth's
passports will be surrendered.</i>

485
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,990
<i>Are those terms okay with you?</i>

486
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:14,742
Um, yeah.

487
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:17,746
He says yes... Great.

488
00:26:17,788 --> 00:26:21,082
- Okay.
<i>- "The Journal" just went online with the story.</i>

489
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:23,410
We have 20 minutes before the
press descends on this place.

490
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,085
<i>Let's do this.</i>

491
00:26:39,603 --> 00:26:42,770
Mr. Madoff.

492
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:44,625
<i>It's very strange and troubling news...</i>

493
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:46,482
<i>...out of Wall Street tonight.</i>

494
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:49,318
<i>Former NASDAQ Stock Exchange
chairman Bernard Madoff...</i>

495
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:51,028
<i>...out on $10 million bond.</i>

496
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:53,155
This man with a stellar reputation...

497
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,699
...seems to have taken a whole lot...

498
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:56,534
...of very smart people to the cleaners.

499
00:26:56,577 --> 00:26:59,037
The man they trusted the most with their money,

500
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:01,413
...a NASDAQ chairman 18 years ago,

501
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,415
...is now confessing to authorities...

502
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,377
...he cheated them of billions of dollars.

503
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:08,212
And there's a bunch of big-time investors...

504
00:27:08,256 --> 00:27:10,089
...wondering, how a guy named Madoff...

505
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:11,673
...made off with their money.

506
00:27:15,055 --> 00:27:16,970
What's gonna happen, Bernie?

507
00:27:19,226 --> 00:27:21,643
- I don't know.
- Are you gonna go to jail?

508
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:25,896
Probably.

509
00:27:25,941 --> 00:27:27,816
For how long?

510
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:30,652
- I don't know, Ruth.
- For a long time or a little?

511
00:27:30,694 --> 00:27:32,069
I don't know.

512
00:27:32,114 --> 00:27:34,279
- What?
- I don't know.

513
00:27:34,324 --> 00:27:36,490
Are they gonna take the apartment away?

514
00:27:38,286 --> 00:27:39,911
- I don't know.
- What about the houses?

515
00:27:39,954 --> 00:27:41,871
What about the boys and the grandkids?

516
00:27:41,914 --> 00:27:45,249
- Ruth. Ruth, enough.
- Look I just wanna know if...

517
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:48,252
I'm sorry if I have questions, Bernie.

518
00:27:48,296 --> 00:27:50,712
I'm sorry if I'm a little scared, okay?

519
00:27:50,757 --> 00:27:52,923
It's just you always keep me in the dark.

520
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:54,633
I keep you in the dark to protect you.

521
00:27:54,678 --> 00:27:57,178
Yeah, well, it doesn't feel that way anymore.

522
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:01,181
I just wanna know what's going on.

523
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:05,018
Please, Bernie, don't keep me in the dark anymore.

524
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:06,688
Just tell me.

525
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:09,481
Tell me.

526
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:13,611
Tell you what, Ruth?

527
00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:18,991
Just tell me,
I don't know...

528
00:28:21,746 --> 00:28:24,037
...what you did.

529
00:28:36,178 --> 00:28:40,512
<i>I met Ruth when she was 13. I was 16.</i>

530
00:28:40,556 --> 00:28:42,681
<i>A friend was having a party in his basement.</i>

531
00:28:42,726 --> 00:28:44,349
<i>Something had happened to the jukebox.</i>

532
00:28:44,393 --> 00:28:46,393
<i>It got knocked around
when he was moving it,</i>

533
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:50,105
<i>...so the only song it'd play
was "Sh-Boom" over and over.</i>

534
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,233
<i>She was this tiny, little blonde...</i>

535
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:54,861
<i>...with enormous blue eyes.</i>

536
00:28:54,904 --> 00:28:56,237
<i>Just gorgeous.</i>

537
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,155
Very funny, too.

538
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,865
You remember that actress Goldie Hawn?

539
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,743
<i>- I do very well.</i>
- Yeah, that was Ruth.

540
00:29:02,787 --> 00:29:04,988
She'd wake up every morning
without a care in the world.

541
00:29:04,998 --> 00:29:07,998
Very lively, very bubbly.

542
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:09,834
Popular, too.

543
00:29:09,877 --> 00:29:12,211
- Were you popular?
- Oh, yeah.

544
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:14,547
I mean, I was a lifeguard at the time.

545
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:16,089
Best job I ever had.

546
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:18,043
I mean, why just be some
regular schnook on the beach...

547
00:29:18,053 --> 00:29:19,335
...when you can be in a guard tower,

548
00:29:19,345 --> 00:29:20,886
...everyone looking up at you?

549
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:23,472
- And you get paid.
- Did Ruth ever get jealous?

550
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:25,432
<i>For the rest of the summer,</i>

551
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:28,560
<i>...she laid out right next to the...
the guard tower every day.</i>

552
00:29:28,604 --> 00:29:30,145
Sometimes I'd whistle down at her

553
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,440
...and she'd look up and call me a dog.

554
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:34,066
But I liked having her there.

555
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,442
It felt good.

556
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:37,945
I mean, we've basically been together

557
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:40,280
...every day since the night we met.

558
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:43,575
It's our 51st anniversary coming up.

559
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,452
Mm.

560
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:47,956
How do you think you were
able to keep it all separate?

561
00:29:47,998 --> 00:29:49,958
For 16 years,

562
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,460
I kept this secret from my wife,

563
00:29:52,504 --> 00:29:54,420
...my brother,

564
00:29:54,463 --> 00:29:56,922
...my sons.

565
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,555
How I was able
to do that...

566
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:05,973
...and maintain any degree of sanity,

567
00:30:06,017 --> 00:30:08,934
...well, it's, uh...

568
00:30:10,396 --> 00:30:12,980

Eleanor.

598
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:33,018
So who's the more handsome brother,
him or me?

599
00:31:33,063 --> 00:31:35,104
All right, we've all heard this one, Casanova.

600
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:37,023
- Come on.
- In my opinion?

601
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:38,399
Be honest.

602
00:31:40,152 --> 00:31:43,112
- Peter's way more attractive.
- Oh.

603
00:31:43,155 --> 00:31:45,774
So you've got a thing for barrel-chested
bald men with big stomachs?

604
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:47,200
Screw you!

<i>In fact, Bernie,</i>

606
00:31:48,745 --> 00:31:51,037
...when I first met Peter,
I said to myself,

607
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:54,248
"My God, this man looks
just like Lee Majors."

608
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:56,291
- Handsome.
- Thank you, Eleanor.

609
00:31:56,335 --> 00:31:58,001
Yeah, that was 25 years ago.

610
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:00,171
Back then, even you were attractive, Eleanor.

611
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:01,881
Stuff it, Bernie.

612
00:32:01,924 --> 00:32:04,133
You know you got a thing for me. Do not lie.

613
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:05,927
You're right, I do.

No. I never thought of the word fraudulent.

In my experience,

645
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:22,295

four different types of pussy.

646
00:33:22,337 --> 00:33:24,588
Okay?
I'm dead serious.

647
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:27,091
You got your... let me show you.
I just saw one.

648
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:28,925
All right, right there.
See there?

649
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,720
That's your Honda Civic pussy.

650
00:33:30,764 --> 00:33:31,929
<i>Gets you where you wanna go.</i>

651
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:34,015
<i>No shame in this pussy at all.</i>

652
00:33:34,057 --> 00:33:35,932
Reliable.
You just, you know,

653
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:37,768
...you're not gonna be proud to be seen...

654
00:33:37,812 --> 00:33:39,604
...riding around town in it, am I right?

655
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:42,190
- <i>Nothing against her.</i>
- What's going on?

656
00:33:42,232 --> 00:33:44,232
It's the world according to Frankie over here.

657
00:33:44,277 --> 00:33:45,755
<i>Right there. You see that there?</i>

658
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:47,277
That's your Buick Regal pussy.

659
00:33:47,322 --> 00:33:49,822
<i>Okay, a step up from the Honda.</i>

660
00:33:49,865 --> 00:33:52,741
Uh, generally they're cleaner, okay?

661
00:33:52,786 --> 00:33:55,161
Roomier, you fit more passengers in there.

662
00:33:55,204 --> 00:33:58,247
I guess there's pros and cons to that in a pussy.

663
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,333
<i>You know, lovely pussy.</i>

664
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,835
<i>Nobody's gonna mistake it for
a Benz, though. Am I right?</i>

666
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:05,712
Okay, thank you. God bless you.

667
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:07,214

00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:08,633
...despite everything you see,

669
00:34:08,675 --> 00:34:10,592

I... I'm not... I'm not...

672
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:16,224

673
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:17,974
...but he's not.

674
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:20,478
We're from nothing.
My father was broke.

675
00:34:20,521 --> 00:34:23,021
We're not rich people.
We're humble people.

676
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:24,856

Yes.

678
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,068

679
00:34:28,112 --> 00:34:29,778
Oh!

680
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,607
I'm gonna have to get out the hose...

681
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:34,324
...and spray him.

682
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:36,244

my personal favorite.

683
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:37,911
I just saw one.

684
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:40,121
There. Now, don't make it obvious.

685
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:42,999
Right there.
That is your Lincoln Continental pussy.

686
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:45,043
<i>Beautiful. Just... it's just right.</i>

687
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:46,830
You know what I mean?
Like Goldilocks just right.

688
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,130
It's not too fancy,
it's not too plain.

689
00:34:49,175 --> 00:34:50,632
It just...
it's just comfortable.

690
00:34:50,677 --> 00:34:52,300
It just... it just fits.

691
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:54,427
No, no, it's like an old pair of slippers...

692
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:56,847
...except instead of your foot,
you put your cock in it.

693
00:34:56,891 --> 00:35:00,141
- Am I wrong?
- You have a daughter, right?

694
00:35:00,186 --> 00:35:02,061
Yeah, Sophie.
She's wonderful.

695
00:35:02,104 --> 00:35:03,728
I can't wait for you to meet her.

696
00:35:03,773 --> 00:35:05,773
And who's the father again?

697
00:35:05,816 --> 00:35:07,525
Um, uh, John,

698
00:35:07,568 --> 00:35:09,652
...my... my ex-partner at Urban Angler.

699
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:11,237
And you two never married?

700
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,780
Um, no. No.

701
00:35:13,824 --> 00:35:16,032
If I had had a baby out of wedlock,

702
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:19,119
...my father would have taken
me out back and shot me.

703
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:24,083
I'm not kidding, he would've shot me.

704
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:25,501
No, no, stay with me...

705
00:35:25,545 --> 00:35:27,168
...and hold all questions till the end.

706
00:35:27,213 --> 00:35:29,588
- Okay.
- Right there, you see that? Ugh.

707
00:35:29,632 --> 00:35:30,840
There it... read it and weep.

708
00:35:30,883 --> 00:35:32,967
It's your Mercedes-Benz pussy.

709
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,260
<i>Right? Look at it.
I mean, it's beautiful.</i>

710
00:35:35,304 --> 00:35:37,762
<i>It's just a feat of vaginal engineering.</i>

711
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:39,764
No, it handles just great.

712
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:41,434
It's sleek, it's tight,

713
00:35:41,476 --> 00:35:43,811
...it looks good, it feels
good, it smells good.

714
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:46,229
But...
a lot of upkeep. Yeah?

715
00:35:46,273 --> 00:35:50,318
Payments are murder and you
gotta wax it, you gotta polish it,

716
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,653
...you gotta... talk to it,
ou gotta listen to it, eh?

717
00:35:53,697 --> 00:35:55,740
<i>And, most importantly,</i>

718
00:35:55,782 --> 00:35:57,240
<i>...you gotta remain ever vigilant...</i>

719
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:59,744
...that nobody fucking jacks it, right?

720
00:35:59,786 --> 00:36:01,661
You don't have to worry about that

721
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:04,248
'cause you'll never get
near anything like that.

722
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:05,916
So don't worry about it.

723
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,626
<i>Is it fair to say...</i>

724
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,253
<i>...that as a result of all of these lies,</i>

725
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:11,797
<i>...you got rich?</i>

726
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,050
Well, I didn't get paid per lie, ma'am.

727
00:36:15,094 --> 00:36:17,719
<i>As a product of the fraud
that was Madoff Securities,</i>

728
00:36:17,764 --> 00:36:19,387
<i>...you got rich, correct?</i>

729
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:21,432
Yeah, that's correct, yeah.

730
00:36:21,476 --> 00:36:23,184
<i>You built, as you described,</i>

731
00:36:23,226 --> 00:36:26,061
<i>...a lavish home in Bridgewater,
New Jersey, correct?</i>

732
00:36:26,104 --> 00:36:28,146
- Well, define "lavish."
- Sure.

733
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,900
- Uh, how many bedrooms did it have?
- Five.

734
00:36:30,943 --> 00:36:32,943
- How many bathrooms?
- Seven.

735
00:36:32,987 --> 00:36:34,862
- How many acres?
- Seven.

736
00:36:34,905 --> 00:36:37,280
- Did it have a swimming pool?
- Yes, it did.

737
00:36:37,324 --> 00:36:39,449
- Did it have a tennis court?
- It did not.

738
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:42,411
- Did it have a pond?
- Yes, it did.

739
00:36:42,454 --> 00:36:44,496
So would you consider...

740
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:46,414
<i>...seven acres, seven bathrooms,</i>

741
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:47,874

742
00:36:47,918 --> 00:36:50,836
<i>...a pond, a lavish home?</i>

743
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,838
I guess I might.

Hey, by the way, you know
Stephanie and I went last weekend...

763
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:07,246
...to see that house in Nantucket?

764
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:09,081
- You know...
- You should try the lobster.

765
00:38:09,124 --> 00:38:11,291
- Oh, no, no, it's okay.
- Oh, trust me on the lobster.

766
00:38:11,335 --> 00:38:13,586
Try the lobster.
Hey!

767
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:16,088
- Dad, you know I got...
- Can you get my son...

768
00:38:16,132 --> 00:38:18,007
- ...a lobster, please?
- ...a weak stomach.

769
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,842
Would you get him a lobster? Just...

770
00:38:19,885 --> 00:38:21,334
Would you like me to get you the lobster?

771
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:23,337
What are you asking him for?
Just get him a lobster.

772
00:38:23,347 --> 00:38:25,597
- He'll thank us both later, okay?
- Seriously...

773
00:38:25,641 --> 00:38:27,766
So, what's the price tag on this house?

774
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:30,561
<i>Uh, they got it at, like, six and a half,</i>

775
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:32,805
<i>- ...but we'll talk them down.
- That's what they're asking for?</i>

776
00:38:32,815 --> 00:38:34,023
Yeah.

777
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:35,900
I mean, it's, like, special.

778
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:39,612
It's, like... it's got a pool
looks out over the ocean.

779
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:41,091
<i>- It's unbelievable.
- Uh-huh.</i>

780
00:38:41,115 --> 00:38:43,949
But I figure we can
get them down a bit.

781
00:38:43,992 --> 00:38:45,742
Now, wait.

782
00:38:45,786 --> 00:38:47,994
That's the way you bring the lobster?

783
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,371
Apologies, sir.

784
00:38:49,414 --> 00:38:50,956
Why don't you bring it back,

785
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:52,624
...take off the claws, open it up.

786
00:38:52,668 --> 00:38:54,585
I mean, I pay enough for this whole thing.

787
00:38:54,628 --> 00:38:56,711
<i>Don't you guys know how to serve a lobster?</i>

788
00:38:56,755 --> 00:38:58,790
- Apologies. I'll be right back.
- Okay, just bring it back properly.

789
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,800
- I mean, what is this?
- You wanna come see it with me?

790
00:39:01,844 --> 00:39:03,544
- We could go down next week and...
- <i>I'll go see it.</i>

791
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:05,179
<i>We can work on the price, too.</i>

792
00:39:05,222 --> 00:39:07,681
<i>Yeah, six and a half,
maybe we can start at five.</i>

793
00:39:07,724 --> 00:39:09,966
- That would be nice.
<i>- We could probably take a boat from Montauk.</i>

794
00:39:09,976 --> 00:39:12,228
- We can go out of the harbor...
- Good idea.

795
00:39:14,523 --> 00:39:16,356
Okay, thanks.

796
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:19,985
So... don't eat that, eat this.

797
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:22,237
- Don't eat...
- I don't like lobster, Dad.

798
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,272
<i>I don't even know why we had that.
I guess your mother...</i>

799
00:39:24,282 --> 00:39:25,990
<i>'Cause it's not good on my stomach.</i>

800
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:27,784
Hey, uh,

801
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:29,869
...take this away, will you, please?

802
00:39:29,914 --> 00:39:32,789
Yes, sir.

803
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,708
- There you go.
- Apologies, sir.

804
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:37,001
<i>Okay.</i>

805
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:39,380

<i>- Come on, Dad.</i>

817
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:06,699
With all due respect, Frank's...

818
00:40:06,742 --> 00:40:08,449
Frank's what?

819
00:40:08,494 --> 00:40:10,827
Frank's an idiot.

820
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:13,079
You know, Frank
never went to college.

821
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:16,416
I heard Frank,
comparing women's vaginas to automobiles...

822
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,126
<i>...earlier today.</i>

823
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,413
Whether Frank is refined enough
for your taste is irrelevant.

824
00:40:20,423 --> 00:40:21,755
He's good at his job.

825
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:23,798
If something were to happen to me,

826
00:40:23,842 --> 00:40:26,209
...he'd fill you guys in on all
the details you need to know.

827
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:28,595
And what if Frank decides to screw you?

828
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:31,222
I mean, I don't even know how much
you're worth. Is it a billion?

829
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:32,974
Two billion?
Three?

830
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:34,759
What if there's three and he says there's two...

831
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,721
...and takes a billion and
rides off into the sunset?

832
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:39,815
Calm down, calm down. Everything is
written down in a safe deposit box.

833
00:40:39,858 --> 00:40:41,941
If something were to happen to me,

834
00:40:41,985 --> 00:40:44,695
...you consult with our lawyers,
and they'll handle it.

835
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:46,362
They'll fill you in on everything.

836
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:48,615
Everything, huh?

837
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:51,202
- That's right, everything.
- Everything? You know, good luck.

838
00:40:51,244 --> 00:40:53,286
This conversation is impossible.

839
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:55,406
- I don't understand why you can't understand...
- Impossible!

840
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,291
What I just said to you.

841
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:02,713
You know, why is it that whenever
this conversation comes up,

842
00:41:02,757 --> 00:41:05,215
...you find a way to wriggle out of
giving me an answer?

843
00:41:05,258 --> 00:41:06,698
It comes up because you bring it up.

844
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:08,635
No, because I'm... we're trying to plan.

845
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:10,296
<i>Well, if you don't bring it up,
it won't come up.</i>

846
00:41:10,306 --> 00:41:11,922
You know, I'm just trying to get a...
a basic sense...

847
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:14,432
You don't have to get a sense of anything, Mark.

848
00:41:14,476 --> 00:41:16,718
- You don't have to get a sense of anything.
- <i>Why is that too much to ask?</i>

849
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:19,604
- I've told you this is something I don't talk about.
- Dad. Dad!

850
00:41:19,648 --> 00:41:21,980
Listen to me.

851
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:23,643
- I don't understand!
- Listen, what is wrong? Are you a fucking idiot?

852
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:25,485
Are you a fucking idiot?!
I mean, answer me!

853
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:27,612
- I don't understand!
- No, you don't understand!

854
00:41:27,657 --> 00:41:29,405
You don't have to fucking understand!

855
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:31,492
<i>You're asking me about taking over the advisory...</i>

856
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:33,401
<i>...and yet you can't even follow
a simple fucking instruction...</i>

You don't understand.

859

You don't understand.

860
00:41:42,588 --> 00:41:44,380
Leave it alone.

861
00:41:45,675 --> 00:41:47,007
Okay.

862
00:41:52,514 --> 00:41:54,056
I'm sorry.

<i>But the truth is it didn't even occur to me.</i>

876
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,683
I guess it's because I never thought...

877
00:42:46,693 --> 00:42:48,360
...of what I was doing was stealing.

878

People felt safe with you.

883
00:43:01,374 --> 00:43:03,751
- <i>Yeah, but these were...</i>
- And yet...

884
00:43:03,793 --> 00:43:06,045
...you were betraying them all.

885
00:43:06,088 --> 00:43:08,172
Well, but these people, you know,

886
00:43:08,215 --> 00:43:09,815
...they had a little greed in them, too.

887
00:43:09,842 --> 00:43:11,507
There was a little bit of, you know...

888
00:43:11,552 --> 00:43:13,844
...look, you know, and they
didn't wanna look too hard.

889
00:43:13,887 --> 00:43:16,929
They looked just far enough.

890
00:43:16,974 --> 00:43:21,309
- So they're accomplices in some way, too.
- Bernie.

891
00:43:21,353 --> 00:43:23,561
Accomplices because they trusted you?

892
00:43:23,606 --> 00:43:26,606
Accomplices because you
were so trustworthy,

893
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,733
...you seemed so trustworthy.

894
00:43:28,778 --> 00:43:30,643
Yeah, but there's a lack
of honesty on their behalf,

895
00:43:30,653 --> 00:43:33,864
...an unwillingness to take responsibility
for their behavior.

896
00:43:33,907 --> 00:43:36,407
- <i>Your investors?</i>
- Yes.

897
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:38,577
It takes a lot of chutzpah...

898
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:40,496
...for you of all people to say that.

899
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:44,458
You know...

900
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,628
...now that I think of it,

901
00:43:48,672 --> 00:43:50,213
...my greatest failure...

902
00:43:50,257 --> 00:43:52,673
...or maybe it's my greatest weakness...

903
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:56,219
...is I've always wanted to please people.

904
00:43:56,262 --> 00:43:58,847
And that's...

905
00:43:58,891 --> 00:44:01,141
...that's one that can get you into trouble.

906
00:44:01,184 --> 00:44:03,268
I've been here all fucking morning!

907
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:06,563
- I wanna go upstairs.
- Sir, nobody's going upstairs right now.

908
00:44:06,606 --> 00:44:08,606
I wanna see somebody in charge.

909
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,350
<i>- Right now, I'm in charge.
- Who are you protecting?!</i>

910
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,485
<i>And you need to back up right now.</i>

911
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,897
- We're talking about my fucking life savings!
- I told you right now!

912
00:44:14,907 --> 00:44:18,492
- Do you understand?
- You need to back up right now, sir.

913
00:44:26,085 --> 00:44:28,585
<i>- Hello, Madoff.
- I'm in the fucking lobby.</i>

914
00:44:28,628 --> 00:44:30,003
<i>I wanna come up.</i>

915
00:44:30,047 --> 00:44:31,588
Sir, I am not able...

916
00:44:31,632 --> 00:44:33,882
...to give you permission
to come up here right now.

917
00:44:33,925 --> 00:44:36,008
<i>Where is my fucking money?!</i>

918
00:44:36,052 --> 00:44:38,137
You have to call the advisory arm.

919
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:42,516
- I can give you their number.
- <i>Fuck you, you fucking thief!</i>

920
00:44:45,186 --> 00:44:47,271
Oh, my God.

921
00:44:47,313 --> 00:44:51,983
<i>Unusual circumstances did not exist for Bernie.</i>

922
00:44:52,027 --> 00:44:53,777
<i>Take 9-11.</i>

923
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,405
When those towers got hit,

924
00:44:56,449 --> 00:44:59,574
...everybody in the whole entire office...

925
00:44:59,617 --> 00:45:02,077
...was gathered around the TV.

926
00:45:02,121 --> 00:45:05,539
Who was crying?
Who was hysterical?

927
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:06,956
Not Bernie.

928
00:45:07,001 --> 00:45:11,545
He kept his head down
and he continued to work.

929
00:45:12,715 --> 00:45:14,298
And it is not like...

930
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,507
...he did not know anybody...

931
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:18,594
...in those buildings.

932
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:23,599
<i>As with every event...</i>

933
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:26,309
<i>...of personal devastation,</i>

934
00:45:26,353 --> 00:45:28,728
<i>...they remember
exactly where they were...</i>

935
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:30,938
<i>...and what they were doing...</i>

936
00:45:30,983 --> 00:45:33,108
<i>...when they learned
they were ruined.</i>

937
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,237
<i>The grayish white paper...</i>

938
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,032
<i>...rolled out of Mary Thomajan's fax machine.</i>

939
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:42,492
<i>The fax was from the small feeder fund...</i>

940
00:45:42,536 --> 00:45:44,994
<i>...she had trusted for 18 years...</i>

941
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:46,662
<i>...telling her that all her money...</i>

942
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:49,081
<i>...had been invested with Madoff,</i>

943
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:51,126
<i>...who had been arrested.</i>

944
00:45:52,295 --> 00:45:54,213
<i>She later recalled,</i>

945
00:45:54,255 --> 00:45:57,048
<i>"In the 50 seconds it took
to read that fax,"</i>

946
00:45:57,092 --> 00:45:59,717
<i>"I went from being
a multi-millionaire..."</i>

947
00:45:59,762 --> 00:46:02,720
<i>"...to having my life savings wiped out..."</i>

948
00:46:02,764 --> 00:46:06,474
<i>"...and life as I knew it
altered forever."</i>

949
00:46:09,188 --> 00:46:12,063
<i>Robert Halio's son called him
at his retirement home...</i>

950
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:14,148
<i>...in Boca Raton with the news.</i>

951
00:46:14,193 --> 00:46:15,983
<i>It's all gone, Dad.</i>

952
00:46:16,028 --> 00:46:19,153
<i>I don't...
I don't know what to do.</i>

953
00:46:19,197 --> 00:46:20,947
<i>95% of his wealth...</i>

954
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:25,159
<i>...had been entrusted to Madoff
and was now gone.</i>

955
00:46:25,204 --> 00:46:27,036
<i>Mr. De la Villehuchet...</i>

956
00:46:27,081 --> 00:46:29,831
<i>...had written his brother a letter that said,</i>

957
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:32,918
<i>"If you ruin your friends,
your clients,"</i>

958
00:46:32,961 --> 00:46:35,420
<i>"...you have to face the consequences."</i>

959
00:46:35,463 --> 00:46:37,297
<i>He then positioned a trash basket...</i>

960
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,215
<i>...to protect the carpet...</i>

961
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,842
<i>...and slit his wrist with a box cutter.</i>

<i>- Richard Freedman...
- David Iselin...</i>

966
00:47:12,293 --> 00:47:14,458
<i>Time to pay the piper, Bernie.</i>

967
00:47:14,503 --> 00:47:17,378
Presumably...

968
00:47:17,423 --> 00:47:20,798
...presumably with the life
savings of another piper.

969
00:47:20,842 --> 00:47:21,882
Just...

970
00:47:21,927 --> 00:47:24,385
This was the worst pyramid scheme...

971
00:47:24,429 --> 00:47:27,889
...since the actual pyramids.

972
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:30,745
- Ruth loves to go to the California Pizza Kitchen.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

973
00:47:30,769 --> 00:47:32,428
And they say that her favorite dish there...

974
00:47:32,438 --> 00:47:34,353
...is the veal Scallo-Ponzi.

975
00:47:36,775 --> 00:47:39,143
Listen, I have something to tell
you that's really important.

976
00:47:39,153 --> 00:47:41,193
I have your money!
I can get it to you.

977
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,900
<i>Okay, I guess you're not there.</i>

978
00:47:47,577 --> 00:47:50,202
They can see right in.

979
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:52,414
- They can see right in.
- What?

980
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:55,333
We... we don't have any curtains.

981
00:47:55,376 --> 00:47:57,501
They can see right in.

982
00:47:57,545 --> 00:47:59,795
<i>Hold on, let me call you back.</i>

983
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,373
- Catherine, it's gonna be fine.
- No, they're gonna be looking in...

984
00:48:02,383 --> 00:48:04,300
...with their long lenses
and we'll be trapped.

985
00:48:04,344 --> 00:48:07,720
They're gonna get bored
just standing around.

986
00:48:07,764 --> 00:48:09,806
I'm not the story.

987
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:12,224
We've gotta get curtains
right now.

988
00:48:40,213 --> 00:48:42,755
Shit.

989
00:48:50,391 --> 00:48:52,349
Hi, how are you?

990
00:48:52,393 --> 00:48:54,059
I'm all right.

991
00:48:54,103 --> 00:48:55,601
You?

992
00:48:55,646 --> 00:48:57,396
I've been better.

993
00:48:58,898 --> 00:49:01,608
I'll bet.

994
00:49:13,371 --> 00:49:15,246
- Mommy, Mommy.
- What?

995
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:18,999
- Is that Ruth Madoff?
- Jessica, not another word.

996
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:20,836
It's okay.

997
00:49:22,172 --> 00:49:25,132
No, none of it is.

998
00:49:45,153 --> 00:49:47,112
There she is.

999
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:05,380
- Hi, Sarah.
- Oh, hi.

1000
00:50:05,423 --> 00:50:07,090
Is Gisele here?
I was wondering...

1001
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:09,008
...if she might be able to fit me in today.

1002
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:11,927
I haven't had my hair colored
in God knows how long.

1003
00:50:11,972 --> 00:50:14,054
- Um, I think she's...
- You know, don't worry.

1004
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:16,016
- I'll find her.
- Uh...

1005
00:50:21,273 --> 00:50:25,065
<i>I've been coming here for 15 years, Pierre.</i>

1006
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,360
<i>I understand.</i>

1007
00:50:28,447 --> 00:50:30,197
<i>We have too many clients...</i>

1008
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,320
<i>...who have lost their money
because of your husband.</i>

1009
00:50:33,327 --> 00:50:35,911
But I don't trust anyone else.

1010
00:50:37,246 --> 00:50:38,829
I'm very sorry,

1011
00:50:38,874 --> 00:50:43,710
...but I can't afford to
risk my reputation.

1012
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,298
What about a house call?

1013
00:50:48,342 --> 00:50:49,925
I can pay extra.

1014
00:50:51,177 --> 00:50:53,094
- I'm sorry...
- Pierre.

1015
00:50:53,137 --> 00:50:55,889
...but I have to ask you to leave now.

1016
00:50:55,932 --> 00:50:57,891
I'm sorry, Ruth.

1017
00:51:05,316 --> 00:51:06,775
- Shit.
<i>- Ruth!</i>

1018
00:51:06,818 --> 00:51:09,735
- What are you doing?
- Nothing!

1019
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,530
What are you doing?

1020
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:13,949
- Looking for something?
- My lighter.

1021
00:51:15,577 --> 00:51:17,151
Well, aren't there matches in the drawer?

1022
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:19,119
- No.
- No? What do you mean?

1023
00:51:19,164 --> 00:51:21,239
- There's always matches in the drawer.
- Well, we're out.

1024
00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:23,083
Where'd you last see it?

1025
00:51:23,126 --> 00:51:24,668
If I knew where I last saw it,

1026
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:26,836
I wouldn't be looking for it, Bernie.

1027
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,802
I'm such an idiot.

1028
00:51:33,845 --> 00:51:35,427
<i>How did I get to be this age...</i>

1029
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:39,014
...without doing anything on my own?

1030
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:40,516
What are you talking about?

1031
00:51:40,561 --> 00:51:42,978
I... I didn't do anything, Bernie.

1032
00:51:43,021 --> 00:51:45,688
I never did one thing on my own.

1033
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:48,900
I... I don't have a career,
I don't have a name,

1034
00:51:48,943 --> 00:51:52,028
I don't... I don't have
any friends of my own.

1035
00:51:52,072 --> 00:51:54,489
The only thing I have are regrets.

1036
00:51:54,532 --> 00:51:56,949
That's all I got to show for myself.

1037
00:51:56,994 --> 00:52:00,911
- Regret after regret.
- Ruth, do we have to go into this now?

1038
00:52:00,956 --> 00:52:02,831
I got a lot on my mind.

1039
00:52:02,874 --> 00:52:05,333
<i>I'm going away and who knows
if I'm going to come back.</i>

1040
00:52:05,376 --> 00:52:08,670
- Why would you say that?
- I'm not saying for certain...

1041
00:52:08,713 --> 00:52:11,840
- No, Ike said that you'd be able to...
- Forget I mentioned it.

1042
00:52:11,883 --> 00:52:13,382
You can't do that.

1043
00:52:13,427 --> 00:52:15,050
I'm not ready.

1044
00:52:15,094 --> 00:52:17,262
I... I'm, I'm not ready to be alone.

1045
00:52:17,306 --> 00:52:19,054
You're all I have.

1046
00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:20,974
The boys don't speak to me.

1047
00:52:21,018 --> 00:52:22,391
No one speaks to me.

1048
00:52:22,436 --> 00:52:25,561
I'll...
I'll go crazy, Bernie.

1049
00:52:25,606 --> 00:52:30,025
I'll... I'll go crazy all alone.

1050
00:52:30,068 --> 00:52:33,360
I'll go crazy, Bernie, I will.

1051
00:53:08,023 --> 00:53:09,459
<i>Hi.</i>

1052
00:53:09,483 --> 00:53:11,273
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

1053
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:13,818
<i>Bernie!</i>

1054
00:53:13,862 --> 00:53:15,570
<i>Bernie, you there?</i>

1055
00:53:15,614 --> 00:53:18,030
<i>Bernie?
Come on, pick up.</i>

1056
00:53:18,074 --> 00:53:19,774
<i>I know you're hiding that 50 billion somewhere,</i>

1057
00:53:19,784 --> 00:53:22,202
<i>...you piece-of-shit cocksucker.</i>

1058
00:53:22,244 --> 00:53:24,279
<i>I hope you enjoy getting your
ass raped every night,</i>

1059
00:53:24,289 --> 00:53:26,246
<i>'cause you're going away for a long time.</i>

1060
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:28,291
<i>Hasta la vista, you kike motherfucker.</i>

1061
00:53:32,088 --> 00:53:33,463
What are you doing?

1062
00:53:33,507 --> 00:53:35,048
<i>I can't live like this.</i>

1063
00:53:35,092 --> 00:53:37,132
Slogging through,

1064
00:53:37,177 --> 00:53:38,969
...being miserable to no good end.

1065
00:53:39,012 --> 00:53:40,970
What's the point?

1066
00:53:41,014 --> 00:53:42,889
You know, I was thinking earlier...

1067
00:53:42,932 --> 00:53:45,349
...this... this isn't even about me.

1068
00:53:46,853 --> 00:53:48,269
This country needs a villain,

1069
00:53:48,313 --> 00:53:50,229
...someone to send to the gallows...

1070
00:53:50,273 --> 00:53:53,273
...so everyone can feel okay
about living under a rigged system.

1071
00:53:53,318 --> 00:53:56,152
I don't give a rat's ass, Bernie.

1072
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:58,530
Well, it'll be better once I go.

1073
00:53:59,824 --> 00:54:01,324
What's with the jewelry?

1074
00:54:01,367 --> 00:54:03,450
It's the only thing the court didn't freeze.

1075
00:54:03,494 --> 00:54:05,119
I'm gonna wrap it all up,

1076
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,789
...give it to family,

1077
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:09,081
...and then kill myself.

1078
00:54:09,126 --> 00:54:11,501
Why would you kill yourself?

1079
00:54:11,545 --> 00:54:14,461
Because I'm tired of being hated.

1080
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:16,255
I don't even understand it.

1081
00:54:16,298 --> 00:54:19,342
I...
you got yourself into trouble.

1082
00:54:19,385 --> 00:54:21,335
You couldn't get out.
What do I have to do with it?

1083
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:22,887
Why does the world hate me?

1084
00:54:22,931 --> 00:54:25,264
They all think I'm some kind of a mastermind.

1085
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:27,099
Take it as a compliment, Ruth.

1086
00:54:27,144 --> 00:54:29,936
They say all these
horrible things about me.

1087
00:54:29,979 --> 00:54:32,604
They say
I... I was your bookkeeper.

1088
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:34,815
- <i>They say...</i>
- You weren't my bookkeeper.

1089
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:37,027
I did maintain the records the first year.

1090
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:39,570
That was in 1960.
It was just you and me.

1091
00:54:39,614 --> 00:54:41,697
I mean, but you weren't even a real bookkeeper.

1092
00:54:41,742 --> 00:54:44,026
No, but I'm just saying don't make
it seem like I didn't pitch in...

1093
00:54:44,036 --> 00:54:46,327
...because I even came back, remember?

1094
00:54:46,371 --> 00:54:48,696
- Yeah, but then we hired a real bookkeeper.
- And I helped with payroll.

1095
00:54:48,706 --> 00:54:51,073
- We hired a real bookkeeper.
- Right, so why are they making it seem...

1096
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:53,543
...like I...
like, I'm involved with all this stuff?

1097
00:54:53,586 --> 00:54:55,503
Because they're out for blood, honey.

1098
00:54:55,547 --> 00:54:57,672
That's why.
They just wanna...

1099
00:54:57,715 --> 00:55:00,550
But anybody in the know knows
you weren't the mastermind.

1100
00:55:00,594 --> 00:55:02,342
- That's nonsense.
- Oh, well, thanks.

1101
00:55:02,387 --> 00:55:03,677
I already wanna kill myself.

1102
00:55:03,722 --> 00:55:05,429
Are you trying to make me feel worse?

1103
00:55:05,474 --> 00:55:08,224
No, but I...

1104
00:55:08,268 --> 00:55:10,309
You, uh...

1105
00:55:10,353 --> 00:55:12,478
...you'd commit suicide?

1106
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,315
<i>With what?</i>

1107
00:55:18,153 --> 00:55:21,570
I don't know. I haven't figured that part out yet.

1108
00:55:21,615 --> 00:55:24,157
Something nice.
Maybe Ambien.

1109
00:55:26,911 --> 00:55:28,744
How much Ambien do we have?

1110
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:31,539
Enough to open a fucking pharmacy.

1111
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:01,068
What about these?
Klonopin?

1112
00:56:01,112 --> 00:56:03,862
Same thing.
Just put it in here.

1113
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:20,420
Do have yourself a merry little Christmas.

1114
00:56:20,465 --> 00:56:22,965
It's a great song and you'll be
hearing Judy Garland sing it...

1115
00:56:23,008 --> 00:56:25,385
<i>Can't we just have quiet?</i>

1116
00:56:25,427 --> 00:56:28,470
I can't fall asleep unless I watch something.

1117
00:56:28,514 --> 00:56:31,599
You just took a whole
fucking bottle

1118
00:56:31,643 --> 00:56:32,976
...of Ambien, Bernie.

1119
00:56:33,019 --> 00:56:35,061
Sleep's not gonna be your problem.

1120
00:56:35,104 --> 00:56:37,646
My mind races.

1121
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,190
Fine.

1122
00:56:40,485 --> 00:56:42,235
Our last night on Earth

1123
00:56:42,278 --> 00:56:44,195
...will be you, me,
and Judy Garland.

1124
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,740
- How romantic.
- Let's not get started, Ruth.

1125
00:56:51,036 --> 00:56:53,704
We had a good life, didn't we?

1126
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:56,081
Yeah,

1127
00:56:56,126 --> 00:56:58,585

...than it did on Black Tuesday in 1929.

1167
00:59:22,188 --> 00:59:25,106
Fucking rigged.

1168
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:27,858
How to fuck the little guy.

1169
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:36,367
I wonder if I can count on you.

1170
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:37,492

<i>You know how with a split-strike

<i>...the stock options offset losses?</i>

1177

<i>It's like insurance.</i>

1178
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:57,047

Yeah, so if anyone double-checks
our trades, we got it all there.

- All winners.
- <i>Fine.</i>

1188
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:22,454

01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:42,182
"Bernie will take care of everything."

1197
01:00:42,226 --> 01:00:46,478
He's gone, and...
I don't know what to do.

1198
01:00:46,523 --> 01:00:48,606
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

1199
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,983
<i>You can take all of Erwin's other accounts...</i>

1200
01:00:51,027 --> 01:00:53,068
...his savings, life insurance, everything...

1201
01:00:53,112 --> 01:00:55,195
...and you can put it all in his account here.

1202
01:00:56,449 --> 01:00:58,657

1239
01:03:08,998 --> 01:03:11,456
<i>...then I wanna know who sets their priorities.</i>

1240
01:03:11,501 --> 01:03:14,585
What made you think that
Bernie Madoff was a fraud?

1241
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:16,745
The key tip-off...
and it took me about five minutes...

1242
01:03:16,755 --> 01:03:18,838
...to figure out that he was a fraud...

1243
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:20,500
<i>...I'm gonna give you a hand
signal and I'm gonna show you...</i>

1244
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:21,875
<i>...what his performance return line looked like.</i>

1245
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:24,387
It went in only one direction...
up.

1246
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:26,347
It never had variation like the market does...

1247
01:03:26,391 --> 01:03:28,349
...like... like this,
but then I did...

1248
01:03:28,393 --> 01:03:31,269
- Who is this guy?
- <i>He tried to warn the SEC about me.</i>

1249
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:35,146
- And what happened?
- They ignored his warnings.

1250
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:37,733
- So what's the point?
- What do mean what's the point?

1251
01:03:37,777 --> 01:03:39,652
Well, what's the point of all this?

1252
01:03:39,695 --> 01:03:41,695
Well, he's saying that basically,

1253
01:03:41,739 --> 01:03:43,405
...he handed the SEC the evidence...

1254
01:03:43,449 --> 01:03:44,865
...and they didn't follow up on it.

1255
01:03:44,909 --> 01:03:47,200
Oh, so a government agency is incompetent.

1256
01:03:47,244 --> 01:03:48,911
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- Yeah, and that's news?

1257
01:03:48,954 --> 01:03:50,613
No, look, I've been saying that for years.

1258
01:03:50,623 --> 01:03:52,498
And I have firsthand knowledge.

1259
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:03,008
This fucking cocksucker walks
in and out of the building...

1260
01:04:03,052 --> 01:04:04,385
...with this jacket on.

1261
01:04:04,429 --> 01:04:06,012
What the fuck is wrong with him?

1262
01:04:06,054 --> 01:04:08,347
Bern, the guy's asking for our DTC account number.

1263
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:09,724
What are we gonna do?

1264
01:04:11,184 --> 01:04:12,801
I mean, all my years dealing with the SEC,

1265
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:15,396
I've never seen this
enforcement.

1266
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,308
Who the fuck does this guy think he is?

1267
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:20,610
Boss, if we don't give the guy the number,

1268
01:04:20,653 --> 01:04:22,395
...it's gonna be obvious that
we're hiding something.

1269
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:24,480
Yeah, but the way he just fucking
walks in here like that,

1270
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:26,449
...no fucking suit or nothing.

1271
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:28,409
- No, I know.
- What kind of fucking arrogance?

1272
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:30,786
The jacket's annoying,
but, Bern, please focus.

1273
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:32,287
If we do give it to him,

1274
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:35,166
...uh, one call to the DTC and that's it.

1275
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:36,626
Game over.

1276
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:38,586
We're just here for a routine exam.

1277
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:40,338
We haven't done one in 10 years.

1278
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,882
- You were just here.
- Uh, we... we weren't.

1279
01:04:42,925 --> 01:04:46,092
- DC Inspections was.
- We don't talk to DC.

1280
01:04:46,137 --> 01:04:49,679
So, uh, tell me
about this article.

1281
01:04:49,724 --> 01:04:52,516
Yeah, I was very bothered by this.

1282
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,476
I mean, why would they make me look fat?

1283
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:55,728
Excuse me?

1284
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:57,479
I mean, look at my face.

1285
01:04:57,523 --> 01:04:59,483
Look at my cheeks.
I look like a fucking porpoise.

1286
01:04:59,525 --> 01:05:02,902
Well, um, yes, but I'm
referring to the allegations.

1287
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:05,905
What about it?
Lori Richards has all this information.

1288
01:05:05,947 --> 01:05:07,822
I sent it to her in a file.
They have it.

1289
01:05:07,867 --> 01:05:09,747
As I told you, we're a very large organization.

1290
01:05:09,786 --> 01:05:12,494
- We don't talk to each other.
- You don't talk to DC?

1291
01:05:12,537 --> 01:05:15,039
N-no.
It... it's, uh...

1292
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:16,666
This is the problem with the SEC.

1293
01:05:16,708 --> 01:05:18,708
I've been saying this for years.

1294
01:05:18,753 --> 01:05:20,753
I mean, you have to have
better communication.

1295
01:05:20,797 --> 01:05:22,205
How are you supposed to be able to do your job...

1296
01:05:22,215 --> 01:05:23,735
...with a fraction of the information?

1297
01:05:23,757 --> 01:05:25,800
Well, we're trying to get all of the information.

1298
01:05:25,842 --> 01:05:28,510
Well, don't you think you
should start by talking to DC?

1299
01:05:28,554 --> 01:05:30,179
I mean, I got... my whole office here

1300
01:05:30,222 --> 01:05:31,381
...is wondering what's happening.

1301
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,807
You come in with that jacket,

1302
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:34,341
...it embarrasses the hell out of all of us.

1303
01:05:34,351 --> 01:05:36,059
And this?
It's a fucking cartoon.

1304
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:37,769
It's an old article.
It's four years old.

1305
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:39,638
And you're asking me questions
about an old article...

1306
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:41,315
...with a silly cartoon?

1307
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:43,316
And you haven't spoken to DC.

1308
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,160
Are we, um... are we waiting on your lawyers?

1309
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:46,778
I never have lawyers in the office...

1310
01:05:46,822 --> 01:05:48,864
...when I'm talking to regulators for two reasons.

1311
01:05:48,907 --> 01:05:50,699
One, I'm not doing anything wrong.

1312
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:52,827
Two, I know the rules better than most...

1313
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:54,704
...because I drafted a majority of them.

1314
01:05:54,746 --> 01:05:56,037
And we haven't met before,

1315
01:05:56,081 --> 01:05:58,039
...but we have very strong relationships.

1316
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:01,335
And I was on the short list for SEC director.

1317
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:03,713
Yes, we...
we know that.

1318
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:06,005
If you need anything at all,
I'll be in my office.

1319
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:08,092
There's no such thing as an inconvenience.

1320
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:09,802
- Thanks.
- I'm here.

1321
01:06:11,931 --> 01:06:13,556
<i>Oh, um,</i>

1322
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:16,474
...by the way, are these securities with the DTC?

1323
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:18,769
- Of course.
- We're gonna need your account number...

1324
01:06:18,813 --> 01:06:21,354
<i>...just so we can verify the assets.</i>

1325
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:24,315
Oh, Bern, you're fucking killing me.

1326
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:30,655
646.

1327
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:32,365
646. Great, thank you.

1328
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:34,067
Do you mind if you take that jacket off...

1329
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:35,411
...before you go out there?

1330
01:06:35,454 --> 01:06:37,787
- <i>Oh, um...</i>
- Just...

1331
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:39,831
<i>Sure.</i>

1332
01:06:39,876 --> 01:06:41,416
<i>One call.</i>

1333
01:06:41,461 --> 01:06:43,335
<i>All the SEC had to do
was make one call...</i>

1334
01:06:43,378 --> 01:06:45,203
<i>...and they would've seen
that everything was fake,</i>

1335
01:06:45,213 --> 01:06:46,797
<i>...that there was nothing there.</i>

1336
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,798
<i>But they never called.</i>

1337
01:06:48,842 --> 01:06:50,967
<i>You just gambled that they wouldn't call?</i>

1338
01:06:51,012 --> 01:06:53,429
<i>It was more than a gamble. It was...</i>

1339
01:06:53,472 --> 01:06:55,472
<i>...it was a leap of faith,
if you will.</i>

1340
01:06:55,516 --> 01:06:58,893
<i>You wait, knowing what they will find...</i>

1341
01:06:58,936 --> 01:07:00,561
<i>...if they make that call.</i>

1342
01:07:00,604 --> 01:07:02,271
I can't imagine what that was like.

1343
01:07:02,315 --> 01:07:06,858
It was... it was
excruciatingly difficult.

1344
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:10,278
At some point, you figured...

1345
01:07:10,322 --> 01:07:13,365
I figured that they didn't do it.

1346
01:07:13,409 --> 01:07:16,659
They just didn't follow up on it.

1347
01:07:18,206 --> 01:07:20,414
<i>If you didn't plan on killing yourself...</i>

1348
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:22,458
<i>...or going into hiding,</i>

1349
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:24,460
<i>...how did you think it would end?</i>

1350
01:07:24,503 --> 01:07:26,253
Well, it was almost like, uh...

1351
01:07:26,297 --> 01:07:28,088
...it sounds horrible to say it now...

1352
01:07:28,132 --> 01:07:30,882
...but I just wanted the whole
world to come to an end.

1353
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:32,592
When 9-11 happened,

1354
01:07:32,637 --> 01:07:34,385
I thought this was the only way out.

1355
01:07:34,429 --> 01:07:36,764
The world would come to
an end, I'd be dead,

1356
01:07:36,807 --> 01:07:38,557
...and everybody would be gone.

1357
01:07:40,019 --> 01:07:41,894
But, I mean, I could've kept it going.

1358
01:07:41,938 --> 01:07:43,478
I could've covered everything.

1359
01:07:43,523 --> 01:07:45,438
Even after the fall of '08,

1360
01:07:45,483 --> 01:07:47,517
I had enough commitments of
cash that would've come in.

1361
01:07:47,527 --> 01:07:49,985
So I could've,
you know... I... I...

1362
01:07:50,028 --> 01:07:51,945
I just got tired.

1363
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:54,197
I knew by Thanksgiving I was gonna give it up.

1364
01:07:54,242 --> 01:07:56,659
I was gonna stop.

1365
01:07:56,702 --> 01:07:58,472
<i>Financial turmoil in the US.</i>

1366
01:07:58,496 --> 01:07:59,954
Wall Street in crisis mode.

1367
01:07:59,996 --> 01:08:01,454
<i>Wall Street on red alert.</i>

1368
01:08:01,499 --> 01:08:04,208
<i>Bear Stearns has effectively gone under.</i>

1369
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:06,460
<i>The largest bankruptcy in US history.</i>

1370
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:09,344
- <i>Unprecedented.
- This is really shaking the foundation of Wall Street.</i>

1371
01:08:09,382 --> 01:08:11,090
A lot of money
and a lot of jobs.

1372
01:08:11,132 --> 01:08:14,175
America's economy is facing
unprecedented challenges.

1373
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:17,178
<i>All of this taking a devastating toll on stocks.</i>

1374
01:08:17,223 --> 01:08:19,431
<i>Single biggest point drop ever.</i>

1375
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,732
<i>I'm sorry to bother you.</i>

1376
01:08:29,776 --> 01:08:31,310
<i>I just got another call you're gonna fucking love.</i>

1377
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,195
- Yeah, go ahead.
- <i>Bank Medici's</i>

1378
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:35,614
...pulling out 450 million, Bern.

1379
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:38,075
Stanley Chais has been
draining us all goddamn year,

1380
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:40,369
<i>...and this is on top of Fairfield's withdrawals.</i>

1381
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:43,414
I delivered for these fucking
people for fucking decades...

1382
01:08:43,456 --> 01:08:45,533
...and now they're all running
for the fucking hills.

1383
01:08:45,543 --> 01:08:47,450
<i>Bern, we can't keep getting
hit with these redemptions.</i>

1384
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,503
We gotta find a way to conserve.

1385
01:08:49,547 --> 01:08:51,422
I think we should lower the returns.

1386
01:08:51,464 --> 01:08:53,299
Are you kidding?
That'll cause a bigger panic.

1387
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:55,543
They'll all pull out, the greedy fucks.
We can't do that.

1388
01:08:55,553 --> 01:08:57,218
<i>Well, we gotta do something.</i>

1389
01:08:57,263 --> 01:08:59,972
We're treading water like
a fucking paraplegic here.

1390
01:09:00,016 --> 01:09:02,382
<i>- I was just saying...</i>
- Hold on, let me get rid of this idiot.

1391
01:09:02,392 --> 01:09:05,393
The joke on the street is that
Bernie's like the Jewish T-bill.

1392
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:07,680
- Very funny. I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone.
- He's that safe.

1393
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:09,022
I'm on the phone.

1394
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:10,941
I'll introduce you guys later.

1395
01:09:10,985 --> 01:09:12,358
He's gonna love you.

1396
01:09:12,402 --> 01:09:14,777
See if you can rattle Fairfield's cage.

1397
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:16,530
In the meantime,
I've got a few ideas.

1398
01:09:16,574 --> 01:09:17,615
- <i>Fairfield?</i>
- Yeah.

1399
01:09:17,657 --> 01:09:19,450
<i>All right.</i>

1400
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,169
<i>- Uh-huh. Nice, nice.
- Not in a bathing suit.</i>

1401
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:34,839
Me neither.

1402
01:09:34,884 --> 01:09:37,259
- Hey.
- Hey, kid.

1403
01:09:37,303 --> 01:09:39,553
I heard you're the one who hustled...

1404
01:09:39,597 --> 01:09:42,764
...those penny stocks in that
shitty office you had downtown.

1405
01:09:42,808 --> 01:09:44,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that's me.

1406
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:47,561
Can you believe I've known this man for 50 years?

1407
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:49,437
Carl, listen, I wanna tell you something.

1408
01:09:49,482 --> 01:09:51,522
Not now.

1409
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:54,233
There are some real opportunities
in the market right now...

1410
01:09:54,277 --> 01:09:56,277
...and I wanna make you
aware of them.

1411
01:09:56,321 --> 01:09:58,321
- Not now, Bernie.
- I know, I know.

1412
01:09:58,366 --> 01:10:00,824
- Not now.
- I know. I wouldn't tell you about them...

1413
01:10:00,867 --> 01:10:02,992
...unless they were really,
really important, okay?

1414
01:10:03,036 --> 01:10:04,786
I don't want you mad at me you missed out.

1415
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:06,789
All right.

1416
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:08,665
How much do you want me to put in?

1417
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:10,709
250.

1418
01:10:10,753 --> 01:10:15,004
- On top of the 300 million I already have with you?
- Yes.

1419
01:10:15,049 --> 01:10:17,215
The market in shambles?

1420
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:19,718
It's plummeting, but now is
the time to take advantage.

1421
01:10:19,762 --> 01:10:22,379
- I'm so exposed...
- That's exactly why I'm proposing this to you.

1422
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:25,598
I'm afraid I'll be arrested
for public indecency.

1423
01:10:25,642 --> 01:10:27,558
Oh, I'm not doing it with everybody.

1424
01:10:27,602 --> 01:10:30,353
- It's just a few people.
- All right, all right. Enough.

1425
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:31,931
- Okay, and you are family.
- I'll tell you.

1426
01:10:31,941 --> 01:10:33,898
Listen, I'll think about it.

1427
01:10:33,942 --> 01:10:35,067
- Okay.
- Okay?

1428
01:10:35,111 --> 01:10:36,360
But don't take too long.

1429
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:38,445
In all seriousness,
don't take too long.

1430
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:40,406
Please don't take too long.

1431
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:43,366
- Carl...
- I said it. I will think about it.

1432
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:45,326
- Period.
- I live you, I respect that.

1433
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:46,911
Thank you very much.

1434
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,375
Fucking rich people.
Parasites.

1435
01:10:51,419 --> 01:10:52,959
You're in a mood.

1436
01:10:58,467 --> 01:11:00,134
I gotta take this.

1437
01:11:03,054 --> 01:11:04,408
<i>Well, I just got off the phone...</i>

1438
01:11:04,432 --> 01:11:05,973
<i>...with that cocksucker at Kingate.</i>

1439
01:11:06,017 --> 01:11:08,017
He's pulling out 260 million.

1440
01:11:08,059 --> 01:11:09,767
Do these fucking people not understand...

1441
01:11:09,812 --> 01:11:11,978
...how a fucking split-strike works?

1442
01:11:12,022 --> 01:11:13,763
- Do they not understand?
- <i>Hold on, I got Fairfield calling me back.</i>

1443
01:11:13,773 --> 01:11:15,190
Hold on.

1444
01:11:15,233 --> 01:11:16,233
Yeah?

1445
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:22,990
Hey, Rick Jarvis.

1446
01:11:23,034 --> 01:11:24,607
We met at the club a few
months back with Solomon.

1447
01:11:24,617 --> 01:11:26,994
Well, look, while I got your attention,

1448
01:11:27,037 --> 01:11:30,955
I just exited this private equity
venture with a five X return.

1449
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I'm looking to put that money to
work right away this quarter.

1450
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:37,170
Well, unfortunately,
that's not possible.

1451
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:38,922
I haven't told you how much.

1452
01:11:38,965 --> 01:11:42,384
- Well, it really doesn't matter.
- $100 million.

1453
01:11:42,428 --> 01:11:44,260
I'm sorry, but the fund...

1454
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:46,304
...is fully subscribed for the quarter.

1455
01:11:46,348 --> 01:11:49,892
- Even in this market?
- My clients know not to worry.

1456
01:11:49,934 --> 01:11:51,267
I know how to avoid the pitfalls.

1457
01:11:51,312 --> 01:11:54,937
Okay, I want in
this quarter, all right?

1458
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:56,773
Whatever restrictions you wanna put on it,

1459
01:11:56,817 --> 01:12:00,276
...you know, I'll park this money
with you for a long time.

1460
01:12:00,321 --> 01:12:02,605
It's not about the money.
It's about pushing clients aside.

1461
01:12:02,615 --> 01:12:05,741
I can't do that.
I have to sacrifice someone,

1462
01:12:05,785 --> 01:12:09,077
...a loyal client to me,
in order to accommodate you.

1463
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,330
Unless it's really, really worth it...

1464
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:13,165
I am talking about giving you

1465
01:12:13,209 --> 01:12:15,041
$100 million.

1466
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:17,044
That's, uh, not gonna do it.

1467
01:12:19,214 --> 01:12:20,839
So what's it gonna take?

1468
01:12:20,883 --> 01:12:22,674
I have to do what's ethical.

1469
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:26,010
- I can't let you jump the line.
- I'll go 150 if you let me.

1470
01:12:26,054 --> 01:12:28,679
- Love to help you, but I can't.
- <i>175.</i>

1471
01:12:28,723 --> 01:12:31,433
Fully subscribed.

1472
01:12:31,477 --> 01:12:33,392
- 200.
- <i>I wish I could.</i>

1473
01:12:33,437 --> 01:12:35,812
I'm just thinking if I... no.

1474
01:12:35,856 --> 01:12:37,397
225?

1475
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,110
<i>250.</i>

1476
01:12:41,152 --> 01:12:42,361
275.

1477
01:12:44,072 --> 01:12:45,822
<i>$300 million.</i>

1478
01:12:47,617 --> 01:12:49,742
How far do we gotta go?
Just tell me.

1479
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:52,830
If you go above four,
we might have something.

1480
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:54,039
<i>400.</i>

1481
01:13:04,593 --> 01:13:05,884
I can do that.

1482
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:07,718
We got a deal.

1483
01:13:10,266 --> 01:13:12,391
I gotta take this phone call.

1484
01:13:12,433 --> 01:13:13,976
Yeah?

1485
01:13:14,018 --> 01:13:15,927
I don't know who the fuck
I was just talking with,

1486
01:13:15,937 --> 01:13:18,681
...but if this guy checks out,
we just picked up a good piece of change.

1487
01:13:18,691 --> 01:13:21,607
Well, the shit is definitely
hitting the fucking fan.

1488
01:13:21,651 --> 01:13:23,192
I got Fairfield-Greenwich on the line.

1489
01:13:23,236 --> 01:13:24,986
- You want me to patch you in?
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

1490
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:27,572
<i>Hey, Bernie. We catching you at a bad time?</i>

1491
01:13:27,616 --> 01:13:29,907
You tell me. I got a back spasm
that's fucking killing me.

1492
01:13:29,951 --> 01:13:31,910
<i>- Bernie. Bernie.</i>
- What's going on?

1493
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:33,320
- Can I just get one minute?
- Not...

1494
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:34,571
Just one minute to introduce you.

1495
01:13:34,581 --> 01:13:35,955
- I can't talk.
- <i>Just one minute!</i>

1496
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,291
- Yeah?
<i>- Look, Bern,</i>

1497
01:13:38,334 --> 01:13:40,878
<i>...you're basically the only fund
that hasn't gotten hammered.</i>

1498
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,160
<i>You're the one place clients
can turn to for liquidity...</i>

1499
01:13:43,174 --> 01:13:44,839
<i>...without taking huge losses.</i>

1500
01:13:44,884 --> 01:13:46,465
<i>It's the winner's curse.</i>

1501
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:49,052
What... what, am I supposed to be flattered...

1502
01:13:49,095 --> 01:13:51,213
...that you just cashed out
a billion and a half dollars?

1503
01:13:51,223 --> 01:13:53,139
You gotta put a stop
to these redemptions...

1504
01:13:53,183 --> 01:13:54,883
...because if you don't,
just know there's plenty of money out there...

1505
01:13:54,893 --> 01:13:57,018
...that would love to take your place.

1506
01:13:57,062 --> 01:14:00,563
- <i>Is that a threat?</i>
- You can take it any way you like.

1507
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:04,276
Look at you all dressed
up and no place to die.

1508
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,196
- Hello, Jeffry.
- Come on, Bernie, there's no need for stress.

1509
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:09,447
I haven't made many withdrawals.

1510
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:15,245
Although, that's probably
something we should discuss, hmm?

1511
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:18,290
I did wanna tell you that there
are some real opportunities...

1512
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:20,791
...in the market right now
if you're interested, Jeffry.

1513
01:14:20,835 --> 01:14:22,044
- Hmm.
- What do you think?

1514
01:14:22,086 --> 01:14:24,129
- We should be talking...
- Mrs. Madoff!

1515
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:26,798
- <i>Mr. Picower.</i>
- Your husband doesn't look well.

1516
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:29,509
You should attend to him, hmm?

1517
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,222
You okay?

1518
01:14:33,264 --> 01:14:35,139
What's wrong with him, Picower?

1519
01:14:35,183 --> 01:14:38,142
He's one strange, sicko fuck.

1520
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:39,852
Oh, by the way, my sister,

1521
01:14:39,897 --> 01:14:41,437
...she's worried about the economy...

1522
01:14:41,482 --> 01:14:42,932
...and she was thinking about investing...

1523
01:14:42,942 --> 01:14:44,441
...the rest of her savings with you.

1524
01:14:44,485 --> 01:14:46,485
- Would that be okay?
- Yeah, sure.

1525
01:15:07,383 --> 01:15:11,259
Walter, I'm not a fucking money
market fund, do you understand?

1526
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:12,843
If you don't stop these withdrawals...

1527
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:14,588
...and replace the money
before the end of the month,

1528
01:15:14,598 --> 01:15:16,431
...then I'm gonna cut you off!

1529
01:15:16,474 --> 01:15:18,424
I'm gonna close the whole
fucking Fairfield account!

1530
01:15:18,434 --> 01:15:19,851
Yes!

1531
01:15:19,894 --> 01:15:21,852
Do you hear me?!

1532
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:28,860
Oh, shit.
What the...?

1533
01:15:33,701 --> 01:15:35,803
<i>- I hated that. No, I didn't!
- You loved it.</i>

1534
01:15:35,827 --> 01:15:37,610
- <i>You came out of there, you said... don't lie.</i>
- Oh, I did not!

1535
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,454
- You're such a liar.
- <i>You're a liar.</i>

1536
01:15:39,498 --> 01:15:41,580
Sweetheart, is that a little bit too rare?

1537
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:43,165
<i>This is good.</i>

1538
01:15:43,209 --> 01:15:45,419
- Everything all right?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1539
01:15:47,714 --> 01:15:50,674
Did you wheel your
luggage into the bedroom?

1540
01:15:50,718 --> 01:15:53,759
- Why?
- Did you wheel your luggage into the bedroom?

1541
01:15:53,803 --> 01:15:57,888
Well, I certainly didn't bring
it in through the window.

1542
01:15:57,933 --> 01:15:59,849
But you smudged the wall by the door.

1543
01:15:59,892 --> 01:16:01,517
You scuffed it with your roller bag.

1544
01:16:02,854 --> 01:16:05,522
Well, string me up and feed me to the dogs.

1545
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:10,736
I'm sorry I scuffed a wall, Bernie.

1546
01:16:12,614 --> 01:16:14,781
<i>Emily, was just asking about Wall Street, Dad.</i>

1547
01:16:15,909 --> 01:16:16,909
Yeah,

1548
01:16:16,951 --> 01:16:18,242
...how is Wall Street, Papa?

1549
01:16:18,286 --> 01:16:19,619
She's working on her MBA.

1550
01:16:19,662 --> 01:16:22,289
Dad, future head of Madoff Securities.

1551
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:23,874
<i>That's right. Watch out, guys.</i>

1552
01:16:25,126 --> 01:16:27,209
I asked how's Wall Street, Papa?

1553
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:30,213
Wall Street is good.

1554
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:32,049
Dad says things are bad at Wall Street.

1555
01:16:32,092 --> 01:16:34,050
Well, Dad told you that,
but things are fine.

1556
01:16:34,093 --> 01:16:36,260
<i>Why are they bad?</i>

1557
01:16:36,304 --> 01:16:37,888
What did I just say?

1558
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:40,598
<i>I asked a question. Why is it bad?</i>

1559
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:42,058
I told you they're not bad.

1560
01:16:42,102 --> 01:16:44,018
Why don't you just eat?

1561
01:16:44,062 --> 01:16:46,979
Well, if it's not bad, why
do they call it a meltdown?

1562
01:16:48,942 --> 01:16:51,651
- Why don't you tell me?
- <i>How am I supposed to know?</i>

1563
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:53,686
- <i>That's why I'm asking you.</i>
- Do you read "Barron's," huh?

1564
01:16:53,696 --> 01:16:55,364
Do you read the "Wall Street Journal"?

1565
01:16:55,406 --> 01:16:57,782
- Why don't you tell me?
- I just asked a question.

1566
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:00,201
<i>You are my granddaughter
and you're an eight-year-old...</i>

1567
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:02,536
...and you shouldn't be asking
me questions like that.

1568
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,698
- I don't feel like talking about Wall Street.
<i>- Hey, Dad.</i>

1569
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:06,824
- I don't feel like... be talking about Wall Street.
- Dad.

1570
01:17:06,834 --> 01:17:08,994
- <i>I'm here having dinner with my family.</i>
- That's enough.

1571
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:10,870
<i>Bernie, what's wrong with you? She's just curious.</i>

1572
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,873
Because she doesn't know what
the hell she's talking about.

1573
01:17:12,883 --> 01:17:15,717
She's eight years old.
I gotta get grilled by this kid.

1574
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,543
- Why are you being so mean?
- <i>I got so many other goddamn things</i>

1575
01:17:17,553 --> 01:17:19,720
I'm worried about on Wall Street...

1576
01:17:19,764 --> 01:17:21,798
...and this kid's asking me
about how Wall Street is!

1577
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:23,892
- Shut up and eat your food!
<i>- Dad!</i>

1578
01:17:23,936 --> 01:17:25,936
It's okay, sweetheart.
Bernie, stop it!

1579
01:17:25,978 --> 01:17:27,896
What's wrong with you?

1580
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,815
Now you're playing the good guy.

1581
01:17:29,857 --> 01:17:32,025
- <i>Honey, it's okay, it's okay.</i>
- Taking her side.

1582
01:17:32,068 --> 01:17:34,111
- She's just curious.
- <i>Now I can't eat.</i>

1583
01:17:34,153 --> 01:17:35,854
- It's okay, it's okay.
- She's an eight-year-old kid.

1584
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:37,656
What's the matter with you?

1585
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:40,491
<i>You're just too smart.</i>

1586
01:17:41,745 --> 01:17:43,202
<i>It's okay.</i>

1587
01:17:51,463 --> 01:17:53,922
<i>I wanna know why you're acting this way.</i>

1588
01:17:53,965 --> 01:17:56,674
The fucking market
is a bloodbath.

1589
01:17:59,595 --> 01:18:03,181
- Ah! God damn it.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1590
01:18:03,224 --> 01:18:04,808
Take it ea... Dad.

1591
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:06,434
Fucking thing.

1592
01:18:06,477 --> 01:18:09,562
What's going on?
Are you all right?

1593
01:18:09,606 --> 01:18:11,857
I started these
blood pressure pills.

1594
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,817
Makes me dizzy.

1595
01:18:13,861 --> 01:18:16,361
- Maybe you should take a couple days off.
- <i>No, I can't.</i>

1596
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:19,321
I have to be at the office
first thing in the morning.

1597
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:22,909
- Founder of Home Depot.
- Reschedule.

1598
01:18:25,037 --> 01:18:27,164
- You know...
- This fucking thing.

1599
01:18:27,206 --> 01:18:29,790
If you ever trusted me...

1600
01:18:29,834 --> 01:18:31,668
...to help you with the advisory,

1601
01:18:31,711 --> 01:18:33,870
...you know, I could handle
this kind of thing for you.

1602
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,298
It's my business, not yours.

1603
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:38,842
Well, what happens when you're gone?

1604
01:18:38,885 --> 01:18:41,253
- I'm not having this discussion with you.
- <i>It's a legitimate question.</i>

1605
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:43,088
- I'm not having this discussion with you.
- <i>What is it, Dad?</i>

1606
01:18:43,098 --> 01:18:44,263
Tell me.
What is it?

1607
01:18:44,308 --> 01:18:45,891
Is it that I'm not cut out?

1608
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:49,602
- Are you not listening?
- Just be honest with me.

1609
01:18:49,646 --> 01:18:52,188
- Just tell me.
- Do you not see what I have to deal with,

1610
01:18:52,232 --> 01:18:54,482
...the shit that I have to
go through on a daily basis?

1611
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:56,651
No, that's why...
that's my point.

1612
01:18:56,695 --> 01:18:58,415
<i>The fucking shit that they put me through?</i>

1613
01:18:58,446 --> 01:19:00,189
<i>That they're trying to fuck me all the time?</i>

1614
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:02,699
Steal from me?
Do you think you can do that?

1615
01:19:02,742 --> 01:19:04,576
Do you think you can deal with that?

1616
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,195
- Yes, I can.
- <i>I don't think you can deal with it.</i>

1617
01:19:06,205 --> 01:19:08,162
<i>Bullshit.
I don't think so.</i>

1618
01:19:08,206 --> 01:19:10,290
You can't stomach that stuff.
That's not in you.

1619
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:12,459
Andy, maybe, but not you.

1620
01:19:12,503 --> 01:19:14,126
What?

1621
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:15,586
Wait, what are you saying?

1622
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:17,088
Are you saying that Andy...

1623
01:19:17,132 --> 01:19:18,339
<i>...what are you saying?</i>

1624
01:19:18,383 --> 01:19:20,634
Andy's better
at his job than I am?

1625
01:19:20,677 --> 01:19:23,385
- <i>Mark.</i>
- I go to that fucking office every single day.

1626
01:19:23,429 --> 01:19:25,054
I do the same thing that he does.

1627
01:19:25,098 --> 01:19:27,848
I gave you a fucking business to run.

1628
01:19:27,892 --> 01:19:29,351
Are you not happy with that?

1629
01:19:29,393 --> 01:19:30,893
<i>Was that not good enough for you?</i>

1630
01:19:30,937 --> 01:19:33,647
It is definitely good enough for me, Dad.

1631
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,097
- <i>I'm just trying...</i>
- Well, then shut the fuck up...

1632
01:19:35,107 --> 01:19:36,766
...and give me a little fucking gratitude.

1633
01:19:36,776 --> 01:19:41,821
Say, "I'm... thanks, Dad."
Can't you do that?

1634
01:19:41,865 --> 01:19:44,024
<i>What, do you think the whole
fucking world owes you something?</i>

1635
01:19:44,034 --> 01:19:45,991
The whole fucking world owes you nothing.

1636
01:19:46,035 --> 01:19:48,195
You gotta work for it,
and I always say this with your mother.

1637
01:19:48,205 --> 01:19:51,455
<i>This is the problem with
having money, an education.</i>

1638
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,124
Nothing is earned.

1639
01:19:53,168 --> 01:19:55,834
You want something,
you gotta fucking work for it.

1640
01:20:00,342 --> 01:20:02,509
What, you don't think I have?

1641
01:20:30,289 --> 01:20:32,162
For you, it was installing sprinklers.

1642
01:20:32,206 --> 01:20:35,333
For me, it was digging ditches
on a construction crew.

1643
01:20:35,376 --> 01:20:39,295
I never would have started Home Depot
if I hadn't had that experience.

1644
01:20:39,339 --> 01:20:41,172
Ken, I wanna be respectful of your time,

1645
01:20:41,215 --> 01:20:42,715
...so I'm gonna get right to it.

1646
01:20:42,759 --> 01:20:45,093
I'm starting a new highly exclusive fund.

1647
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:46,928
It's gonna have just five investors.

1648
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:48,722
Same split-strike conversion strategy...

1649
01:20:48,764 --> 01:20:51,141
...that's performed so consistently.

1650
01:20:51,183 --> 01:20:53,058
But, frankly,

1651
01:20:53,102 --> 01:20:55,352
...this fund's gonna have even higher returns.

1652
01:20:55,397 --> 01:20:56,979
The only thing is that it relies...

1653
01:20:57,023 --> 01:20:58,848
...on the market volatility
that we're seeing now,

1654
01:20:58,858 --> 01:21:01,651
...so I gotta put the money together right away.

1655
01:21:01,695 --> 01:21:03,770
Your current fund's been running
for a while, hasn't it?

1656
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:05,405
It has.
Decades.

1657
01:21:05,449 --> 01:21:07,156
Double digit returns every year.

1658
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,617
And you're promising even better returns
for the new fund?

1659
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:11,285
It's a unique opportunity, Ken.

1660
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:12,954
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1661
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:15,123
<i>So I'm asking myself only one question.</i>

1662
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:19,209
What if I'm a
longtime client of yours...

1663
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:22,088
...and, uh,
how would I feel...

1664
01:21:22,132 --> 01:21:24,132
...getting shafted for new customers?

1665
01:21:24,175 --> 01:21:27,552
There are other people
that I do other funds with,

1666
01:21:27,595 --> 01:21:29,921
...but I don't wanna include them
in this because they're not...

1667
01:21:29,931 --> 01:21:32,348
- Whoa, whoa, wait a second.
- they're not the ones...

1668
01:21:32,392 --> 01:21:34,433
Okay, just a second.
I'm a little confused.

1669
01:21:34,477 --> 01:21:36,644
You got this fund,
you got that fund,

1670
01:21:36,687 --> 01:21:38,638
...you got people who are long-term
customers and you're not gonna...

1671
01:21:38,648 --> 01:21:40,140
Those people are already taken care of.

1672
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:42,067
We have... we have other funds with them.

1673
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:44,186
Bernie, I don't... I don't know
what you're trying to say.

1674
01:21:44,196 --> 01:21:46,071
- <i>Well...</i>
- I'm confused.

1675
01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:48,781
<i>The new fund is getting money
before the other people?</i>

1676
01:21:48,825 --> 01:21:51,660
- That's not what I'm saying.
- <i>That's exactly what you're saying.</i>

1677
01:21:51,702 --> 01:21:54,161
I'm not saying that.
They are taken care of.

1678
01:21:54,205 --> 01:21:56,164
I have other arrangements with them.

1679
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:57,790
<i>Something is not kosher here.</i>

1680
01:21:57,834 --> 01:21:59,541
- <i>Something.</i>
- No, it's all kosher.

1681
01:21:59,585 --> 01:22:01,878
I think it's not kosher.
I think it's total bullshit.

1682
01:22:01,922 --> 01:22:03,295
That's what I think.

1683
01:22:03,339 --> 01:22:05,005
It's hitting me the wrong way.

1684
01:22:05,049 --> 01:22:07,217
Something is wrong here.

1685
01:22:07,259 --> 01:22:10,594
I think you're full of shit,
that's what I think.

1686
01:22:10,638 --> 01:22:12,388
I'm getting the hell out of here.

1687
01:22:24,151 --> 01:22:25,442
Is that guy in?

1688
01:22:26,696 --> 01:22:28,112
You're kidding me.

1689
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:33,492
All right, well, uh,
between Medici, Kingate,

1690
01:22:33,536 --> 01:22:35,536
...and the fucking Spaniards,

1691
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:39,249
...that's minus 1.5 billion right there.

1692
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:44,003
Thanks to Fairfield,
we're down 980 in November...

1693
01:22:44,047 --> 01:22:48,924
...and we're looking at at least
minus 580 in December, Bern.

1694
01:22:48,968 --> 01:22:51,635
We write that fucking check,
it's gonna bounce.

1695
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:53,804
We got 300 million left.

1696
01:22:53,848 --> 01:22:55,389
What do you wanna do?

1697
01:22:55,433 --> 01:22:57,517
Hey, Carl, this is great news.

1698
01:22:57,561 --> 01:22:59,602
I just want you to know
it's great news.

1699
01:22:59,646 --> 01:23:02,104
- <i>All right, take care.</i>
- Okay, of course, of course.

1700
01:23:02,148 --> 01:23:03,690
- Great. Okay, talk soon.
- <i>That's it.</i>

1701
01:23:03,733 --> 01:23:05,316
- Thank you.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1702
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,901
He's in for 250.

1703
01:23:06,945 --> 01:23:09,361
All right.
That's not nothin'.

1704
01:23:09,406 --> 01:23:10,864
<i>No, but it's not enough.</i>

1705
01:23:10,906 --> 01:23:13,366
No, it's definitely not enough.

1706
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:14,942
What about that schmuck from Palm Beach?

1707
01:23:14,952 --> 01:23:16,494
Oh, no, no, no, it was, like,

1708
01:23:16,537 --> 01:23:17,904
20 fucking questions with that guy.

1709
01:23:17,914 --> 01:23:19,621
He wanted to know why our controller...

1710
01:23:19,665 --> 01:23:21,458
...was based in Bermuda.

1711
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,126
Why our auditor was a
one-man operation

1712
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:26,504
...working out of a strip mall
in upstate New York.

1713
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:28,673
It was a whole fucking thing with that guy.

1714
01:23:32,845 --> 01:23:34,845
<i>It's not an easy conversation.</i>

1715
01:23:34,889 --> 01:23:36,784
<i>I've already laid the groundwork for this.</i>

1716
01:23:36,808 --> 01:23:38,849
<i>You're hardly in the office anymore.</i>

1717
01:23:38,893 --> 01:23:41,018
I think what I say is that...

1718
01:23:41,062 --> 01:23:42,771
Andrew, sweetheart,

1719
01:23:42,813 --> 01:23:44,306
...you don't have to sell him on a decision

1720
01:23:44,316 --> 01:23:45,982
...that you're making for yourself.

1721
01:23:46,026 --> 01:23:48,651
- <i>This is about you.</i>
- I know, I know.

1722
01:23:48,695 --> 01:23:51,028
It's just hard because I know
he's gonna be disappointed.

1723
01:23:51,071 --> 01:23:53,239
Well, I'm not.

1724
01:23:53,282 --> 01:23:55,532
I am very proud of you.

1725
01:23:55,576 --> 01:23:58,076
<i>Thanks.</i>

1726
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,537
<i>Okay, I'll see you when I get home.</i>

1727
01:24:00,581 --> 01:24:02,040
<i>I love you.</i>

1728
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:05,834
Dad?

1729
01:24:05,879 --> 01:24:07,336
You okay?
What's wrong?

1730
01:24:07,379 --> 01:24:09,672
Oh, fucking back spasms.
It's all seized up.

1731
01:24:09,715 --> 01:24:11,840
This is the only position that doesn't kill.

1732
01:24:11,884 --> 01:24:13,759
I'm sorry.
Can I get you something?

1733
01:24:13,803 --> 01:24:15,594
I already took a bunch of pills.

1734
01:24:15,638 --> 01:24:17,931
- <i>What's up?</i>
- Uh, nothing.

1735
01:24:17,973 --> 01:24:20,183
- We can talk later.
- <i>Look, what do you need?</i>

1736
01:24:20,227 --> 01:24:21,392
No, forget it.

1737
01:24:21,436 --> 01:24:24,019
Well, fucking spit it out.

1738
01:24:24,063 --> 01:24:25,638
Well, I wanna talk to you about a few things.

1739
01:24:25,648 --> 01:24:28,191
<i>Then spit it out.
Come on.</i>

1740
01:24:28,235 --> 01:24:32,570
Well...
well, look... um

1741
01:24:32,614 --> 01:24:35,072
I'm thinking about taking
office space somewhere else.

1742
01:24:37,117 --> 01:24:39,160
You're thinking about leaving the business?

1743
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:41,745
I'm ready to strike out on my own.

1744
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:45,458
And here I was worried about
the business I handed you.

1745
01:24:45,501 --> 01:24:48,126
Look, I have professional goals of my own.

1746
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:50,213
And I'd like to run my own company someday...

1747
01:24:50,257 --> 01:24:52,082
...and it's obviously not
happening here anytime soon.

1748
01:24:52,092 --> 01:24:53,967
<i>You're pretty fucking selfish, Andrew.</i>

1749
01:24:54,009 --> 01:24:55,802
You got some fucking nerve.

1750
01:24:55,845 --> 01:24:58,720
I've worked here forever
and I'm still not a partner.

1751
01:24:58,764 --> 01:25:01,307
It's your name on the doors,
as you love to say.

1752
01:25:01,351 --> 01:25:03,726
You obviously can't see how
selfish you're being right now.

1753
01:25:03,769 --> 01:25:06,009
Let me ask you something,
do you know what kind of offers

1754
01:25:06,022 --> 01:25:07,354
I've gotten to sell this firm?

1755
01:25:07,398 --> 01:25:09,065
- <i>Do you?</i>
- No, I don't.

1756
01:25:09,108 --> 01:25:11,776
The last one was from Goldman
for a billion dollars.

1757
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,695
What?
Why didn't you take it?

1758
01:25:13,737 --> 01:25:15,446
<i>Because I didn't wanna take it.</i>

1759
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:17,106
<i>I need it like I need a fucking hole in the head.</i>

1760
01:25:17,116 --> 01:25:18,556
And the main reason I didn't take it

1761
01:25:18,576 --> 01:25:20,076
...is because of you boys,
that's why.

1762
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,680
Because one day,
I want this to be yours

1763
01:25:21,705 --> 01:25:23,245
...with your name on the door.

1764
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,791
<i>I mean, why else would you think I'd do it?</i>

1765
01:25:30,504 --> 01:25:31,629
<i>You're welcome.</i>

1766
01:25:34,384 --> 01:25:36,634
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, I heard you.

1767
01:25:46,271 --> 01:25:48,646
<i>Bernie, how far... does your wife know?</i>

1768
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:51,816
<i>Bernie, does your wife know?</i>

1769
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:53,379
<i>People familiar with the case...</i>

1770
01:25:53,402 --> 01:25:55,445
<i>...tell CBS News
federal investigators...</i>

1771
01:25:55,487 --> 01:25:57,362
<i>...are ripping apart
20 years of fraud...</i>

1772
01:25:57,406 --> 01:25:59,490
<i>...inside Madoff's firm,</i>

1773
01:25:59,534 --> 01:26:01,075
<i>...moving beyond Bernie,</i>

1774
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:03,285
<i>...looking at sons Andrew and Mark...</i>

1775
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:04,745
<i>...who directed trading activities,</i>

1776
01:26:04,789 --> 01:26:06,155
<i>...and brother Peter, the company's...</i>

1777
01:26:06,165 --> 01:26:07,790
<i>...chief compliance officer.</i>

1778
01:26:07,834 --> 01:26:10,418
<i>None have been charged
with any wrongdoing.</i>

1779
01:26:10,461 --> 01:26:12,586
<i>So, now as Bernie Madoff prepares</i>

1780
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:15,298
- <i>for what may be his last night of comfort in...</i>
- Hey.

1781
01:26:15,342 --> 01:26:17,008
What is it?

1782
01:26:17,052 --> 01:26:19,052
I don't know,
maybe it's a waste of time,

1783
01:26:19,094 --> 01:26:21,595
...but I thought that I would try to write.

1784
01:26:21,639 --> 01:26:24,389
Write what?

1785
01:26:24,433 --> 01:26:25,849
<i>I don't know, a book.</i>

1786
01:26:27,562 --> 01:26:30,228
Ah, it sounds stupid.

1787
01:26:30,272 --> 01:26:33,482
No, it doesn't sound stupid.

1788
01:26:33,526 --> 01:26:37,570
It may not be any good,
but I... I, um...

1789
01:26:37,614 --> 01:26:39,821
...this is just the opening.

1790
01:26:42,242 --> 01:26:43,576
<i>Do you wanna hear it?</i>

1791
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,244
Yeah, I'd love to hear it.

1792
01:26:51,835 --> 01:26:54,586
"Up until December 10th, 2008,"

1793
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:56,589
"I spent the entirety of my life..."

1794
01:26:56,633 --> 01:26:59,217
"...in awe of my father."

1795
01:26:59,259 --> 01:27:01,177
"I judged every accomplishment,"

1796
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:04,304
"...every failure, professionally
or personally,"

1797
01:27:04,348 --> 01:27:05,723
"...against the life he lived."

1798
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:07,558
<i>"His approval meant everything,"</i>

1799
01:27:07,602 --> 01:27:09,059
<i>"...maybe too much,"</i>

1800
01:27:09,103 --> 01:27:10,894
<i>"...and for as long
as I can remember,"</i>

1801
01:27:10,938 --> 01:27:14,022
<i>"I worked as hard as I could
to make him proud."</i>

1802
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:16,067
<i>"And then one day,"</i>

1803
01:27:16,111 --> 01:27:19,070
<i>"I found out that my father
was not the man I thought."</i>

1804
01:27:19,114 --> 01:27:22,949
"He was a criminal,
a man I didn't respect."

1805
01:27:22,992 --> 01:27:25,410
"And yet this man, my father,"

1806
01:27:25,452 --> 01:27:29,037
"...is the same man
who taught me right from wrong,"

1807
01:27:29,081 --> 01:27:31,665
"...taught me to be fair
and decent and honest,"

1808
01:27:31,709 --> 01:27:34,293
"...taught me about the
importance of character,"

1809
01:27:34,336 --> 01:27:37,379
"...what it means to be a husband,"

1810
01:27:37,424 --> 01:27:41,425
<i>"...and, most importantly,
how to be a father."</i>

1811
01:27:42,887 --> 01:27:46,597
<i>"I am the son of Bernie Madoff."</i>

1812
01:27:46,641 --> 01:27:49,976
"I used to think that I
could never escape that."

1813
01:27:50,019 --> 01:27:52,061
"Now I'm certain I won't."

1814
01:27:53,732 --> 01:27:55,732
"Why is it so hard to believe..."

1815
01:27:55,775 --> 01:27:57,933
"...that those closest to him
wouldn't see him as a criminal?"

1816
01:27:57,943 --> 01:28:00,236
"Why is it so hard
to believe that his son..."

1817
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:03,822
"...would think his father
could do no wrong?"

1818
01:28:03,866 --> 01:28:07,242
<i>"When I look
at my youngest son, Nick,"</i>

1819
01:28:07,286 --> 01:28:10,120
<i>"I fear the day
when he's old enough to ask..."</i>

1820
01:28:10,165 --> 01:28:13,124
<i>"...what his grandfather was like."</i>

1821
01:28:13,168 --> 01:28:15,000
<i>"What kind of man was he?"</i>

1822
01:28:15,044 --> 01:28:19,172
"If I tell him he was evil,"

1823
01:28:19,214 --> 01:28:22,799
"...how can I explain that I'm"...

1824
01:28:28,183 --> 01:28:29,432
"...that I"...

1825
01:28:36,357 --> 01:28:38,107
It's good, Mark.

1826
01:28:39,861 --> 01:28:41,861
<i>It's really good.</i>

1827
01:28:41,905 --> 01:28:43,653
Yeah, I... I don't know.

1828
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:56,166
<i>So, is it a plea deal?</i>

1829
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:58,251
<i>No. He's just pleading guilty.</i>

1830
01:28:58,295 --> 01:28:59,920
<i>So, he's just gonna plead guilty...</i>

1831
01:28:59,964 --> 01:29:01,839
<i>...to all the charges and that's it?</i>

1832
01:29:01,883 --> 01:29:03,132
It looks that way.

1833
01:29:03,175 --> 01:29:05,093
- So there will be no trial?
- No.

1834
01:29:05,135 --> 01:29:07,928
<i>Have you read what they're saying about us?</i>

1835
01:29:07,972 --> 01:29:11,223
Every fucking day
they're calling for our head...

1836
01:29:11,267 --> 01:29:13,683
<i>...every paper, every blog.</i>

1837
01:29:13,727 --> 01:29:15,261
<i>How are those people gonna know we're innocent</i>

1838
01:29:15,271 --> 01:29:16,978
<i>...if there's no trial?
How?!</i>

1839
01:29:17,022 --> 01:29:19,315
- How?
- The sooner he is locked up...

1840
01:29:19,358 --> 01:29:20,732
- Bullshit.
- This will be over.

1841
01:29:20,776 --> 01:29:22,610
It's gonna fucking linger.

1842
01:29:22,653 --> 01:29:24,653
The questions, the suspicions,

1843
01:29:24,696 --> 01:29:26,822
...the fucking paparazzi camped out...

1844
01:29:26,866 --> 01:29:28,741
Are they not charging him with conspiracy?

1845
01:29:28,785 --> 01:29:31,410
No, he won't plead guilty to conspiracy.

1846
01:29:31,454 --> 01:29:33,432
<i>Mr. Madoff, are you going to plead guilty?</i>

1847
01:29:33,455 --> 01:29:35,705
<i>They should charge him anyway and force a trial.</i>

1848
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:37,916
<i>If they took Dad to trial, what would happen?</i>

1849
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,584
<i>Just think about it, Mark.</i>

1850
01:29:39,629 --> 01:29:41,711
<i>You're talking about putting the richest...</i>

1851
01:29:41,755 --> 01:29:44,382
<i>...and most powerful people
in the world up on that stand.</i>

1852
01:29:44,424 --> 01:29:47,802
You're talking about JP Morgan,

1853
01:29:47,845 --> 01:29:51,722
Chase, HSBC, Swiss Banks.

1854
01:29:51,766 --> 01:29:55,726
You're talking about
the world's financial system on trial.

1855
01:29:55,769 --> 01:29:58,312
Now, I'm not a conspiracy theorist,

1856
01:29:58,356 --> 01:30:00,522
...but trust me,
that will never happen.

1857
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:01,941
Ever.

1858
01:30:01,985 --> 01:30:03,860
So, no,

1859
01:30:03,902 --> 01:30:05,236
...there won't be a trial.

1860
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,362
The public won't know the truth.

1861
01:30:07,406 --> 01:30:10,282
And we'll be left to fend for ourselves.

1862
01:30:10,326 --> 01:30:12,742
<i>I don't understand, Mark.</i>

1863
01:30:12,786 --> 01:30:14,829
<i>Do you want a trial?</i>

1864
01:30:14,873 --> 01:30:16,037
No.

1865
01:30:16,081 --> 01:30:18,665
Well, what do you want?

1866
01:30:20,294 --> 01:30:22,586
I want my life back.

1867
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:32,074
<i>We're not here. Leave a message.</i>

1868
01:30:32,098 --> 01:30:34,389
Mom again.

1869
01:30:34,433 --> 01:30:37,727
<i>Hi, it's me again.</i>

1870
01:30:37,769 --> 01:30:39,812
Your mother.

1871
01:30:39,856 --> 01:30:43,816
I don't know why I'm calling.

1872
01:30:45,736 --> 01:30:48,862
<i>I feel like such a moron...</i>

1873
01:30:48,906 --> 01:30:50,947
<i>...leaving all these messages,</i>

1874
01:30:50,991 --> 01:30:52,782
<i>...begging you.</i>

1875
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:55,160
<i>I don't know.</i>

1876
01:30:56,830 --> 01:30:58,539
I miss you.

1877
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:01,166
I miss Stephanie, I miss Audrey.

1878
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:04,879
<i>I haven't even seen little Nick.</i>

1879
01:31:04,923 --> 01:31:08,257
<i>I haven't even seen my grandson.</i>

1880
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:10,759
<i>What am I supposed to do, Mark?</i>

1881
01:31:10,803 --> 01:31:14,095
<i>I'm stuck.</i>

1882
01:31:14,139 --> 01:31:16,766
<i>I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry for what he did.</i>

1883
01:31:16,808 --> 01:31:18,351
<i>I don't know what he was thinking.</i>

1884
01:31:18,393 --> 01:31:20,143
<i>I can't even fathom it.</i>

1885
01:31:20,187 --> 01:31:24,106
I just don't understand
why you're so angry at me.

1886
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:26,233
I know you want me to leave him,

1887
01:31:26,276 --> 01:31:28,193
...but I can't just abandon him.

1888
01:31:28,237 --> 01:31:30,655
How am I supposed to
just walk out...

1889
01:31:30,697 --> 01:31:32,656
...of a 50-year marriage?

1890
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:35,534
He's my lifetime.

1891
01:31:35,577 --> 01:31:38,912
He's my whole, entire memory.

1892
01:31:38,956 --> 01:31:42,875
<i>I don't know anything else.</i>

1893
01:31:42,919 --> 01:31:45,001
<i>I've never been on my own.</i>

1894
01:31:47,089 --> 01:31:49,965
I'm not as brave as you two.

1895
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:55,345
Call me.

1896
01:32:01,853 --> 01:32:03,937
<i>How do you now plead to count one...</i>

1897
01:32:03,982 --> 01:32:06,898
<i>...the charge of securities fraud,</i>

1898
01:32:06,942 --> 01:32:08,483
<i>...guilty or not guilty?</i>

1899
01:32:08,527 --> 01:32:09,943
Guilty.

1900

<i>How do you plead to count two...</i>

1901
01:32:12,197 --> 01:32:15,324
<i>...the charge of
investment advisory fraud,</i>

1902
01:32:15,367 --> 01:32:16,534
<i>...guilty or not guilty?</i>

1903
01:32:16,576 --> 01:32:18,952
Guilty.

1904
01:32:18,996 --> 01:32:21,037
<i>How do you now plead to count three...</i>

1905
01:32:21,081 --> 01:32:22,915
<i>...the charge of mail fraud?</i>

1906
01:32:22,959 --> 01:32:24,416
<i>...guilty or not guilty?</i>

1907
01:32:24,459 --> 01:32:26,419
Guilty.

1908
01:32:26,461 --> 01:32:29,213
- <i>How do you now plead to count four?</i>
- Guilty.

1909
01:32:29,257 --> 01:32:32,383
- <i>How do you now plead to count five?</i>
- Guilty.

1910
01:32:32,427 --> 01:32:35,553
- <i>How do you now plead to count six?</i>
- Guilty.

1911
01:32:35,595 --> 01:32:38,681
- <i>How do you now plead to count seven?</i>
- Guilty.

1912
01:32:38,724 --> 01:32:41,558
- <i>How do you now plead to count eight?</i>
- Guilty.

1913
01:32:41,602 --> 01:32:44,437
- <i>How do you now plead to count nine?</i>
- Guilty.

1914
01:32:46,232 --> 01:32:47,690
Guilty.

1915
01:32:49,568 --> 01:32:50,942
Guilty.

1916
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:56,449
As Mr. Madoff has pled guilty,

1917
01:32:56,491 --> 01:33:00,201
...he is no longer entitled
to the presumption of innocence.

1918
01:33:00,245 --> 01:33:03,621
In light of his age,
he has incentive to flee.

1919
01:33:03,665 --> 01:33:05,958
<i>He has the means to flee...</i>

1920
01:33:06,001 --> 01:33:08,001
<i>...and thus,
bail is revoked</i>

1921
01:33:08,045 --> 01:33:10,588
...and the defendant is remanded.

1922
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:12,964
Your Honor, would Your Honor
consider, respectfully,

1923
01:33:13,009 --> 01:33:14,292
...a stay so that we might appeal...

1924
01:33:14,302 --> 01:33:16,677
<i>Your request for a stay is denied.</i>

1925
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,347
<i>Mr. Madoff,
I will see you at sentencing.</i>

1926
01:33:19,389 --> 01:33:21,307
- Sorry, Bernie.
- <i>We are adjourned.</i>

1927
01:33:24,896 --> 01:33:26,519
<i>If you are visiting an inmate...</i>

1928
01:33:26,563 --> 01:33:27,854
<i>...in the maximum security wing,</i>

1929
01:33:27,898 --> 01:33:30,775
...form a single-file line to your right.

1930
01:33:51,422 --> 01:33:53,339
Stop here.

1931
01:33:53,383 --> 01:33:54,964
Keys.

1932
01:34:03,017 --> 01:34:04,474
Turn around.

1933
01:34:05,852 --> 01:34:07,143
Open your legs.

1934
01:34:11,108 --> 01:34:13,629
<i>In the cell next to me, they got this terrorist.</i>

1935
01:34:13,652 --> 01:34:15,253
<i>Some sheikh.
I can't remember his name.</i>

1936
01:34:15,278 --> 01:34:18,321
<i>But that's my neighbor.
Go figure.</i>

1937
01:34:18,366 --> 01:34:19,865
<i>I don't understand...</i>

1938
01:34:19,909 --> 01:34:22,410
<i>...why they put you in maximum security.</i>

1939
01:34:26,415 --> 01:34:28,874
Did you finish packing up the apartment?

1940
01:34:28,918 --> 01:34:30,750
<i>There's not much left to pack.</i>

1941
01:34:30,794 --> 01:34:32,836
<i>They're taking everything.</i>

1942
01:34:32,879 --> 01:34:34,588
They even said to me,

1943
01:34:34,632 --> 01:34:36,552
"We're gonna need your
underwear and nightgowns."

1944
01:34:36,592 --> 01:34:39,552
- Who said that?
- US Marshals.

1945
01:34:39,594 --> 01:34:41,262
What would they want your underwear for?

1946
01:34:41,304 --> 01:34:43,681
They're gonna sell it.
They're gonna auction it off.

1947
01:34:44,892 --> 01:34:46,267
It's unbelievable.

1948
01:34:46,309 --> 01:34:48,102
Nothing is off-limits to these people.

1949
01:34:48,146 --> 01:34:49,586
<i>I don't even like to think about it.</i>

1950
01:34:49,604 --> 01:34:52,522
It's so spooky.

1951
01:34:52,567 --> 01:34:55,151
<i>Have you spoken to the boys?</i>

1952
01:34:55,193 --> 01:34:57,695
No one speaks to me...

1953
01:34:57,737 --> 01:35:01,115
...except my sister.

1954
01:35:01,159 --> 01:35:04,451
Joan even offered to let me
come stay with her in Boca.

1955
01:35:04,495 --> 01:35:06,661
- Well, she's your sister.
- Yeah, I know,

1956
01:35:06,705 --> 01:35:10,875
...but considering she and Bob
lost everything they had...

1957
01:35:10,918 --> 01:35:13,544
It was all with you.

1958
01:35:13,588 --> 01:35:16,045
I mean, it meant a lot to me.

1959
01:35:16,089 --> 01:35:18,507
Yeah, that was unfortunate.

1960
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:20,668
That's why I was hoping
to have those few extra days...

1961
01:35:20,678 --> 01:35:22,398
...to make sure everyone was taken care of.

1962
01:35:24,014 --> 01:35:27,933
I just feel like such a
total putz.

1963
01:35:27,977 --> 01:35:31,937
I... I mean,
when you don't know what's going on,

1964
01:35:31,981 --> 01:35:33,897
<i>...you don't even know what to say.</i>

1965
01:35:33,941 --> 01:35:38,067
I mean, how am I supposed to
explain the Cohmad withdrawals?

1966
01:35:38,111 --> 01:35:39,736
You asked me to transfer money...

1967
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:41,155
...from one account to another.

1968
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,656
I do it and a few hours later,

1969
01:35:43,701 --> 01:35:46,701
...you tell me it's all a Ponzi scheme.

1970
01:35:46,745 --> 01:35:48,704
<i>All these questions...</i>

1971
01:35:48,748 --> 01:35:52,583
<i>...and I don't
have any answers, Bernie.</i>

1972
01:35:52,626 --> 01:35:54,125
Even if you had told me,

1973
01:35:54,169 --> 01:35:57,588
I'm not sure I
would've turned you in.

1974
01:35:59,258 --> 01:36:01,759
I don't know what that says about me.

1975
01:36:03,513 --> 01:36:05,888
That's the tragedy of it.

1976
01:36:08,392 --> 01:36:11,101
<i>Mr. Madoff, are you scared
you're gonna lose your home?</i>

1977
01:36:11,144 --> 01:36:13,646
<i>Mr. Madoff, what do you have
to say to all of the people...</i>

1978
01:36:13,688 --> 01:36:15,792
- Please go away.
<i>- What the hell is wrong with you?!</i>

1979
01:36:15,816 --> 01:36:18,776
- Please leave us alone.
<i>- Can you put the camera down?</i>

1980
01:36:18,818 --> 01:36:20,361
Do you feel guilty?

1981
01:36:20,403 --> 01:36:21,924
Do you feel remorseful?

1982
01:36:21,947 --> 01:36:23,656
<i>You feeling like you're scared?</i>

1983
01:36:23,699 --> 01:36:25,824
Do you feel any responsibility?

1984
01:36:25,867 --> 01:36:27,187
What the hell is wrong with you?!

1985
01:36:27,202 --> 01:36:28,642
What kind of person chases a family?

1986
01:36:28,662 --> 01:36:30,870
You don't have any right to touch my personal...

1987
01:36:30,915 --> 01:36:33,199
- <i>I could sue you for shoving me.</i>
- Oh, fuck you! Get in line.

1988
01:36:33,209 --> 01:36:35,750
<i>Do you enjoy this?
Do you enjoy...</i>

1989
01:36:40,132 --> 01:36:41,924
<i>I don't get it, Mark.</i>

1990
01:36:41,968 --> 01:36:44,509
- I don't get it.
- What's there to get?

1991
01:36:44,553 --> 01:36:47,679
Your first instinct was to abandon us.
I don't get that.

1992
01:36:47,723 --> 01:36:49,589
- I was waiting for you here...
- <i>You left his stroller...</i>

1993
01:36:49,599 --> 01:36:51,267
<i>...in the middle of the street, Mark.</i>

1994
01:36:51,309 --> 01:36:52,634
- It was on the sidewalk.
- <i>It doesn't matter.</i>

1995
01:36:52,644 --> 01:36:53,927
You just left me to deal with everything.

1996
01:36:53,937 --> 01:36:55,262
Do you understand how unfair that is?

1997
01:36:55,272 --> 01:36:57,106
This is about me.
They want me.

1998
01:36:57,148 --> 01:36:59,482
- This isn't about you.
- No, this is about all of us.

1999
01:36:59,526 --> 01:37:02,193
I... I am sick and tired of
you acting like it's not.

2000
01:37:02,237 --> 01:37:05,155
- <i>You know...</i>
- So what do you want, Steph? You want a divorce?

2001
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:09,826
Just some acknowledgement.

2002
01:37:20,798 --> 01:37:24,215
<i>Financial swindler Bernie

2004
01:37:28,138 --> 01:37:30,058
<i>...to see if those who were closest to Madoff...</i>

2005
01:37:30,098 --> 01:37:32,016
Great.
This is unbelievable.

2006
01:37:32,058 --> 01:37:35,268
<i>What has been called

<i>...that he and only he
perpetuated this crime.</i>

2009
01:37:41,067 --> 01:37:43,861

2012
01:37:48,576 --> 01:37:50,826
It's not fair.

2013
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:54,079
It's not fair to you
and it's not fair to me.

2014
01:37:54,123 --> 01:37:56,498

Create a little distance.

2019

<i>...say they are guilty of no crimes,</i>

2022
01:38:21,025 --> 01:38:23,858
<i>...but authorities and victims are
having trouble swallowing...</i>

2023
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:35,329
Andrew fucking Madoff.

2024
01:38:35,373 --> 01:38:37,121
How have you been, Reed?

2025
01:38:37,165 --> 01:38:39,625
Well, after your father fucked us all over,

2026
01:38:39,669 --> 01:38:42,126
...things have been
fucking fantastic.

2027
01:38:42,170 --> 01:38:43,836
Yeah, lots of job interviews.

2028
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:45,839
No one willing to hire me, of course.

2029
01:38:45,883 --> 01:38:49,050
Working at BLM for seven years,
I guess I'm tainted.

2030
01:38:49,094 --> 01:38:51,344
Well, I know it's been tough on all of us,

2031
01:38:51,388 --> 01:38:52,679
...but you're a solid trader.

2032
01:38:52,723 --> 01:38:54,556
You'll find a job in no time.

2033
01:38:54,599 --> 01:38:56,433
Yeah, I get a lot of questions.

2034
01:38:56,477 --> 01:38:58,434
Yeah, especially about you, you and Mark.

2035
01:38:58,478 --> 01:38:59,812
"So the sons knew, right?"

2036
01:38:59,854 --> 01:39:01,513
"They were in on it.
They had to be, right?"

2037
01:39:01,523 --> 01:39:04,107
Reed, when I found out,
it was like my head exploded.

2038
01:39:04,151 --> 01:39:06,026
- I just...
- Shh, you hear that?

2039
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:08,445
- What?
- It's the world's tiniest violin...

2040
01:39:08,489 --> 01:39:10,697
...playing the world's saddest fucking song.

2041
01:39:10,741 --> 01:39:12,324
I understand you're upset...

2042
01:39:12,367 --> 01:39:14,410
Yeah, well, how about making it right?

2043
01:39:14,452 --> 01:39:16,829
<i>'Cause I was looking at a $450,000 bonus.</i>

2044
01:39:16,871 --> 01:39:19,039
A lot of traders were owed bonuses, Reed.

2045
01:39:19,083 --> 01:39:21,583
You weren't the only one.
We all got screwed.

2046
01:39:21,626 --> 01:39:23,419
I thought you were all about family.

2047
01:39:23,461 --> 01:39:26,170
Well, what the fuck am I?
Am I not family, Andy?

2048
01:39:26,214 --> 01:39:27,630
Come on, where's the fucking money?

2049
01:39:27,674 --> 01:39:28,882
What'd you do with the money?

2050
01:39:28,925 --> 01:39:30,925
We all know you stole it.

2051
01:39:30,969 --> 01:39:32,210
Of course you took it.
You're a criminal!

2052
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:33,720
I got fucked over, too!

2053
01:39:33,763 --> 01:39:36,264
By my own father!
My own father fucked me over!

2054
01:39:36,308 --> 01:39:38,976
Yeah, is that your whore?
I see you, whore!

2055
01:39:39,018 --> 01:39:40,686
- Hey! You...
- Hey!

2056
01:39:40,729 --> 01:39:42,353
Hey!

2057
01:39:42,397 --> 01:39:45,816
Stop it!
Andy, get in the car.

2058
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:48,485
Hey!
Jesus, get in the car.

2059
01:39:48,528 --> 01:39:50,320
Jesus.

2060
01:39:52,657 --> 01:39:55,534
- Asshole. Hey!
- Here's your fucking latke,

2061
01:39:55,577 --> 01:39:57,995
- ...knish or whatever, you fuck.
- Hey!

2062
01:39:59,165 --> 01:40:00,789
Fuck you!

2063
01:40:00,833 --> 01:40:02,633
I know you're in on it!

2064
01:40:02,668 --> 01:40:05,334
Ugh.

2065
01:40:11,218 --> 01:40:14,218
<i>The question is where did all the money go?</i>

2066
01:40:14,263 --> 01:40:17,347
Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee,

2067
01:40:17,391 --> 01:40:18,973
...the liquidator,

2068
01:40:19,017 --> 01:40:21,517
...is searching for the billions
that disappeared...

2069
01:40:21,562 --> 01:40:24,271
<i>...and trying to recover as much as possible...</i>

2070
01:40:24,315 --> 01:40:26,440
<i>...from Madoff's remaining assets.</i>

2071
01:40:26,483 --> 01:40:28,567
Of all the people that should've known,

2072
01:40:28,611 --> 01:40:30,611
...his brother and his sons,

2073
01:40:30,653 --> 01:40:32,737
...who worked under the same roof with him,

2074
01:40:32,781 --> 01:40:34,531
<i>...should've known.</i>

2075
01:40:34,575 --> 01:40:37,034
- One would think so, yes.
<i>- Did they know?</i>

2076
01:40:37,076 --> 01:40:39,495
<i>My belief is, yes, they knew.</i>

2077
01:40:39,537 --> 01:40:44,665
Clearly, they would have to
have known what was going on

2078
01:40:44,709 --> 01:40:47,960
- <i>given their own personal transactions...</i>
- Oh, we should've known?

2079
01:40:48,004 --> 01:40:50,004
We worked for market making.

2080
01:40:50,049 --> 01:40:52,965
He worked for IA.

2081
01:40:53,009 --> 01:40:55,377
- How would we have known?
<i>- If they turn out to be untouchable,</i>

2082
01:40:55,387 --> 01:40:59,223
<i>...criminally, do you intend
to bankrupt them civilly?</i>

2083
01:40:59,266 --> 01:41:01,349
<i>Whether or not they have a criminal problem,</i>

2084
01:41:01,392 --> 01:41:04,812
<i>...we will pursue them
as far as we can pursue them.</i>

2085
01:41:04,854 --> 01:41:07,147
And if that leads to
bankrupting them,

2086
01:41:07,191 --> 01:41:09,607
...then that's what will happen.

2087
01:41:15,324 --> 01:41:18,826
<i>The man sitting in this courtroom robbed me.</i>

2088
01:41:18,869 --> 01:41:21,870
He discarded me like roadkill.

2089
01:41:21,914 --> 01:41:25,958
What can we possibly say good
about Madoff...

2090
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,169
...when he sank so low...

2091
01:41:29,213 --> 01:41:32,297
...as to steal from Elie Wiesel...

2092
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:35,925
...as if Wiesel
hasn't already suffered enough in his lifetime.

2093
01:41:37,345 --> 01:41:39,972
My wife and I
are not millionaires.

2094
01:41:40,014 --> 01:41:42,849
<i>We worked hard for all our lives...</i>

2095
01:41:42,892 --> 01:41:46,102
...and he took our entire life savings.

2096
01:41:46,146 --> 01:41:49,940
Mr. Madoff not only defrauded
thousands of investors,

2097
01:41:49,983 --> 01:41:53,818
...he mastered the art of
manipulating our government.

2098
01:41:53,862 --> 01:41:56,196
The money Madoff stole from my family...

2099
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:59,491
...had been set aside
to take care of my brother...

2100
01:41:59,535 --> 01:42:02,410
...because he's gonna need medical
assistance for the rest of his life.

2101
01:42:02,454 --> 01:42:06,039
If he's attempting to protect his family,

2102
01:42:06,083 --> 01:42:08,333
...he should not be given the opportunity...

2103
01:42:08,376 --> 01:42:10,878
<i>...because we, his victims,</i>

2104
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:13,004
<i>...did not have the same opportunity...</i>

2105
01:42:13,048 --> 01:42:15,132
<i>...to protect our families.</i>

2106
01:42:15,174 --> 01:42:19,343
<i>You have left your family with a legacy of shame.</i>

2107
01:42:19,388 --> 01:42:21,304
<i>You have a marriage made in hell,</i>

2108
01:42:21,348 --> 01:42:25,349
<i>...and that is where you are going to return.</i>

2109
01:42:25,393 --> 01:42:28,102
<i>I only hope his prison sentence is long enough...</i>

2110
01:42:28,147 --> 01:42:30,731
<i>...that his jail cell becomes his coffin.</i>

2111
01:42:30,773 --> 01:42:33,817
<i>May God spare you no mercy.</i>

2112
01:42:33,861 --> 01:42:35,401
<i>I am responsible...</i>

2113
01:42:35,446 --> 01:42:37,987
<i>...for a great deal of suffering and pain.</i>

2114
01:42:38,031 --> 01:42:40,197
<i>I understand that.</i>

2115
01:42:40,241 --> 01:42:42,241
<i>I live in a tormented state...</i>

2116
01:42:42,285 --> 01:42:44,201
<i>...now knowing of all the pain and suffering...</i>

2117
01:42:44,245 --> 01:42:46,079
<i>...that I have created.</i>

2118
01:42:46,123 --> 01:42:47,748
<i>That's something I will live with...</i>

2119
01:42:47,790 --> 01:42:49,374
<i>...for the rest of my life.</i>

2120
01:42:49,418 --> 01:42:52,169
People have accused me of being silent...

2121
01:42:52,211 --> 01:42:54,004
...and not being sympathetic.

2122
01:42:54,048 --> 01:42:56,423
That is not true.

2123
01:42:56,467 --> 01:42:58,842
I apologize to my victims.

2124
01:43:01,388 --> 01:43:03,388
I will turn and face you.

2125
01:43:18,196 --> 01:43:19,696
I'm sorry.

2126
01:43:23,369 --> 01:43:25,494
I know that doesn't help.

2127
01:43:27,498 --> 01:43:29,498
Your Honor,

2128
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:31,208
...thank you for listening.

2129
01:43:33,336 --> 01:43:35,211
<i>The message must be sent...</i>

2130
01:43:35,254 --> 01:43:36,964
<i>...that Mr. Madoff's crimes...</i>

2131
01:43:37,007 --> 01:43:39,049
<i>...were extraordinarily evil.</i>

2132
01:43:39,093 --> 01:43:42,678
<i>This kind of irresponsible
manipulation of the system...</i>

2133
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:45,597
<i>...takes a staggering human toll.</i>

2134
01:43:45,641 --> 01:43:48,683
Mr. Madoff will get what he deserves...

2135
01:43:48,727 --> 01:43:50,477
...and will be punished...

2136
01:43:50,521 --> 01:43:54,313
...according to
his moral culpabilities.

2137
01:43:54,357 --> 01:43:57,608
<i>Mr. Madoff,
please stand.</i>

2138
01:43:57,652 --> 01:43:59,652
<i>It is the judgment of this court...</i>

2139
01:43:59,696 --> 01:44:02,571
<i>...that the defendant,
Bernard L. Madoff,</i>

2140
01:44:02,616 --> 01:44:05,366
...shall be and hereby is sentenced...

2141
01:44:05,410 --> 01:44:08,620
<i>...to a term of imprisonment
of 150 years.</i>

2142
01:44:17,548 --> 01:44:20,048
- What about our money, Bernie?!
<i>- Yes!</i>

2143
01:44:20,092 --> 01:44:23,300
Where's our money?!

2144
01:44:23,344 --> 01:44:25,012
As a technical matter,

2145
01:44:25,054 --> 01:44:27,556
...the sentence must be expressed in months.

2146
01:44:27,598 --> 01:44:30,267
<i>150 years is equivalent...</i>

2147
01:44:30,309 --> 01:44:32,893
<i>...to 1,800 months.</i>

2148
01:44:32,937 --> 01:44:34,812
We are adjourned.

2149
01:44:54,751 --> 01:44:57,355
<i>We're standing outside of the
Federal Correctional Complex...</i>

2150
01:44:57,379 --> 01:44:59,086
<i>...in Butner, North Carolina,</i>

2151
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:01,839
<i>...where Bernie Madoff just arrived
minutes ago.</i>

2152
01:45:01,884 --> 01:45:03,884
<i>We saw Mr. Madoff arrive on a bus...</i>

2153
01:45:03,927 --> 01:45:05,718
<i>...with a group of other inmates...</i>

2154
01:45:05,763 --> 01:45:09,306
<i>...where he will serve his
150-year prison sentence.</i>

2155
01:45:09,348 --> 01:45:11,974
<i>Officials have said he will
be watched carefully...</i>

2156
01:45:12,018 --> 01:45:13,893
<i>...to ensure he is not a danger to himself...</i>

2157
01:45:13,937 --> 01:45:16,854
<i>...as he faces the long years ahead.</i>

2158
01:45:37,835 --> 01:45:40,044
Hmm.

2159
01:45:40,089 --> 01:45:42,192
<i>Visiting hours at the prison are very liberal,</i>

2160
01:45:42,215 --> 01:45:44,590
<i>...and people close to the
Madoffs say his wife Ruth...</i>

2161
01:45:44,634 --> 01:45:47,803
<i>...may well move to North Carolina
to be close to her husband.</i>

2162
01:45:47,845 --> 01:45:51,306
Oh, fuck you, you asshole.
I'm in Florida.

2163
01:45:51,349 --> 01:45:52,766
Very much in love...

2164
01:45:52,809 --> 01:45:54,809
...just like Bonnie was to Clyde, Charlie.

2165
01:45:54,852 --> 01:45:57,652
Bonnie robbed banks.
Bonnie killed people.

2166
01:45:57,688 --> 01:45:59,940
- And I'm Bonnie?

01:46:02,401 --> 01:46:04,318
How am I Bonnie?

2169
01:46:04,362 --> 01:46:06,780
Bonnie was a killer.
Bonnie killed people.

2170
01:46:06,824 --> 01:46:08,197
And I'm Bonnie?

2171
01:46:13,162 --> 01:46:15,121
<i>For 16 years, I kept this secret...</i>

2172

<i>...from my wife, from my brother,</i>

2173
01:46:17,166 --> 01:46:18,583
<i>...my sons.</i>

2174
01:46:18,626 --> 01:46:19,959
How I was able to do that...

2175
01:46:20,003 --> 01:46:21,753
...and maintain any degree of sanity,

2176
01:46:21,797 --> 01:46:23,955
...well, that... that worries
me when I think about it.

2177
01:46:23,965 --> 01:46:25,882
You already mentioned that.

2178
01:46:27,177 --> 01:46:28,321
Yeah, I did.

2179
01:46:28,344 --> 01:46:30,803
But while we're on the subject,

2180
01:46:30,848 --> 01:46:33,013
...you say you wanted to protect your family.

2181
01:46:33,058 --> 01:46:34,849
<i>Right.</i>

2182
01:46:34,892 --> 01:46:36,684
But just an example,

2183
01:46:36,727 --> 01:46:38,269
<i>...what would have happened...</i>

2184
01:46:38,312 --> 01:46:41,940
<i>...if at some point before the crisis of '08,</i>

2185
01:46:41,983 --> 01:46:44,608
<i>...you'd been hit by a bus,
you'd drop dead?</i>

2186
01:46:44,652 --> 01:46:47,278
Mark and Andrew would've become the owners...

2187
01:46:47,321 --> 01:46:50,574
...of a firm that was still
in the middle...

2188
01:46:50,616 --> 01:46:53,951
...of perpetrating the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history.

2189
01:46:53,995 --> 01:46:56,955
Except the advisory was a
completely separate business,

2190
01:46:56,999 --> 01:46:59,499
...one in which they had no involvement, so...

2191
01:46:59,543 --> 01:47:01,459
But with you dead...

2192
01:47:01,503 --> 01:47:03,169
...and Frank probably willing...

2193
01:47:03,213 --> 01:47:05,463
...to swear to anything to save himself,

2194
01:47:05,507 --> 01:47:07,464
<i>...seems to me the odds are...</i>

2195
01:47:07,509 --> 01:47:10,593
<i>...that as owners
as lifelong executives,</i>

2196
01:47:10,637 --> 01:47:12,262
...they'd have gone to jail.

2197
01:47:12,306 --> 01:47:14,638
Your sons would be sitting there where you are.

2198
01:47:14,683 --> 01:47:17,267
No, well, I protected them.

2199
01:47:17,311 --> 01:47:21,146
<i>You couldn't have protected
them if you were dead, Bernie.</i>

2200
01:47:21,190 --> 01:47:23,231
<i>So who would've been held responsible?</i>

2201
01:47:23,275 --> 01:47:24,773
I would've been.

2202
01:47:24,817 --> 01:47:26,735
<i>They would've been, Bernie.</i>

2203
01:47:26,777 --> 01:47:30,030
<i>They would've been held responsible,</i>

2204
01:47:30,072 --> 01:47:33,450
...which means
one of two things is true.

2205
01:47:33,492 --> 01:47:36,160
Either they actually were guilty...

2206
01:47:36,205 --> 01:47:38,787
...and accepted the risks...

2207
01:47:38,831 --> 01:47:42,625
<i>...or you were willing to let your sons
go to jail...</i>

2208
01:47:42,669 --> 01:47:44,628
<i>...for the crime you committed.</i>

2209
01:47:46,130 --> 01:47:47,839
<i>Which is it, Bernie?</i>

2210
01:47:47,883 --> 01:47:50,549
I do like jousting with you.

2211
01:47:50,593 --> 01:47:52,302
I'm not jousting with you, Bernie.

2212
01:47:52,345 --> 01:47:54,470
- Yeah, well...
- I'm not jousting with you.

2213
01:47:54,513 --> 01:47:57,641
It seems to me like...

2214
01:48:03,022 --> 01:48:06,148
...like you're
refusing...

2215
01:48:06,192 --> 01:48:10,195
...to recognize
that hazard...

2216
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:12,571
...you created for your family.

2217
01:48:12,616 --> 01:48:14,281
Not just the day you were arrested,

2218
01:48:14,326 --> 01:48:16,617
...but the hazard that they lived under,

2219
01:48:16,661 --> 01:48:21,080
...unknowing, for,
well, however long...

2220
01:48:21,124 --> 01:48:22,915
...you were operating this fraud.

2221
01:48:22,959 --> 01:48:26,169
Eventually, they would be exonerated.

2222
01:48:26,213 --> 01:48:28,329
- Period.
- <i>How could you have been so certain of that,</i>

2223
01:48:28,339 --> 01:48:29,798
<i>...that you were willing to risk it?</i>

2224
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:31,840
Because they were never involved, ever,

2225
01:48:31,884 --> 01:48:34,343
...and there's no way it's ever
gonna be proven otherwise.

2226
01:48:36,598 --> 01:48:38,431
So it doesn't matter.

2227
01:48:38,474 --> 01:48:40,132
It's a terrible thing that they're going through,

2228
01:48:40,142 --> 01:48:43,143
...but they never would have been convicted...

2229
01:48:43,187 --> 01:48:44,771
...because they couldn't be convicted.

2230
01:48:44,815 --> 01:48:47,482
Because they didn't do anything.

2231
01:48:47,526 --> 01:48:49,442
Neither did my wife.

2232
01:48:49,486 --> 01:48:53,530
Nothing.
Zero.

2233
01:48:53,572 --> 01:48:56,866
- <i>But you know what you've done...</i>
- I know what I've done.

2234
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:59,660
- <i>Has shattered your family.</i>
- I take full responsibility for that...

2235
01:48:59,705 --> 01:49:03,956
...and it'll... it'll
kill me for the rest of my life.

2236
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,709
But...

2237
01:49:17,931 --> 01:49:22,224
<i>Over the course of the summer and fall of 2009,</i>

2238
01:49:22,268 --> 01:49:25,644
<i>...the government auctioned off Madoff's property.</i>

2239
01:49:25,688 --> 01:49:27,897
<i>The beach house in Montauk...</i>

2240
01:49:27,941 --> 01:49:30,482
<i>$9 million.</i>

2241
01:49:30,526 --> 01:49:32,568
<i>The penthouse in Manhattan...</i>

2242
01:49:32,611 --> 01:49:33,902
<i>$8 million.</i>

2243
01:49:33,946 --> 01:49:35,780
<i>The Palm Beach house...</i>

2244
01:49:35,824 --> 01:49:39,200
<i>...available for $7.25 million.</i>

2245
01:49:39,244 --> 01:49:42,245
<i>The Mercedes-Benz station wagon,
yachts and power boats,</i>

2246
01:49:42,289 --> 01:49:45,248
<i>Mets jacket, a hodgepodge of personal items...</i>

2247
01:49:47,501 --> 01:49:50,003
<i>By the fall of 2009,</i>

2248
01:49:50,047 --> 01:49:52,088
<i>Picard had separately collected...</i>

2249
01:49:52,132 --> 01:49:54,174
<i>...roughly 1.5 billion...</i>

2250
01:49:54,217 --> 01:49:56,759
<i>...from the firm's brokerage and bank accounts,</i>

2251
01:49:56,803 --> 01:50:00,179
<i>...asset sales,
and a few out-of-court settlements.</i>

2252
01:50:00,223 --> 01:50:02,598
We filed suit against Ruth Madoff...

2253
01:50:02,642 --> 01:50:03,974
...for 44 million.

2254
01:50:04,018 --> 01:50:05,309
We have filed a clawback suit...

2255
01:50:05,353 --> 01:50:07,853
...against Mark and Andrew Madoff...

2256
01:50:07,897 --> 01:50:11,941
...for the return of $127.5 million.

2257
01:50:18,366 --> 01:50:22,410
You can be in charge of the castle.

2258
01:50:22,454 --> 01:50:25,789
You can be in charge of the dresses.

2259
01:50:25,831 --> 01:50:29,334
- I get the dresses, right?
- Isn't that wig hysterical?

2260
01:50:29,378 --> 01:50:31,669
That's great.

2261
01:50:37,218 --> 01:50:39,427
Could you watch her for a minute?

2262
01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:41,888
<i>Mark, any time we try...</i>

2263
01:50:41,932 --> 01:50:43,473
<i>...to move on with our life,</i>

2264
01:50:43,517 --> 01:50:45,392
<i>Bernie just finds a way to drag us back down.</i>

2265
01:50:45,434 --> 01:50:47,227
- <i>I'm sick of it.</i>
- I'm sorry.

2266
01:50:47,269 --> 01:50:49,512
I tell you, you get angry.
I don't tell you, you get angry.

2267
01:50:49,522 --> 01:50:50,979
What am I supposed to do?

2268
01:50:51,023 --> 01:50:53,942
<i>I don't know. It's just...</i>

2269
01:50:53,985 --> 01:50:55,735
<i>Oh, what the fuck
is wrong with this guy?</i>

2270
01:50:55,778 --> 01:50:57,403
<i>Suing our four-year-old daughter?</i>

2271
01:50:57,446 --> 01:50:59,739
- <i>It's insane.</i>
- I know, I'm sorry.

2272
01:50:59,782 --> 01:51:01,366
I just... I hate that every time

2273
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:04,869
I start to feel normal again,
something bad happens.

2274
01:51:04,912 --> 01:51:07,914
<i>Have you
checked your text messages?</i>

2275
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:09,374
No.

2276
01:51:14,047 --> 01:51:16,964
Oh, my God, he's so cute.

2277
01:51:18,343 --> 01:51:19,717
I love you.

2278
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:21,428
<i>I love you, too.</i>

2279
01:51:21,470 --> 01:51:23,388
Bye.

2280
01:51:23,432 --> 01:51:24,848
<i>Bye.</i>

2281
01:51:46,620 --> 01:51:48,329
<i>Hey, Marty,</i>

2282
01:51:48,373 --> 01:51:50,456
<i>I sent you the article.
Did you get it?</i>

2283
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:53,084
<i>Anyway, please
give me a call back.</i>

2284
01:51:53,128 --> 01:51:55,210
Hey, man, it's me.

2285
01:51:55,254 --> 01:51:57,254
What, are you away or something,

2286
01:51:57,299 --> 01:51:59,632
'cause I called you earlier
today and you didn't answer.

2287
01:51:59,675 --> 01:52:02,259
I left a message for Marty and
he's not there either.

2288
01:52:02,303 --> 01:52:03,803
Like, nobody ever seems to be around.

2289
01:52:03,847 --> 01:52:06,181
Everybody's out of town or something.

2290
01:52:08,392 --> 01:52:10,184
<i>I'm leaving you another message.</i>

2291
01:52:10,227 --> 01:52:12,061
<i>I know I keep leaving
you messages, Andrew.</i>

2292
01:52:12,104 --> 01:52:15,231
I can't even reach Stephanie.
I can't reach anybody!

2293
01:52:15,275 --> 01:52:16,900
I'm seriously gonna lose it.

2294
01:52:16,942 --> 01:52:17,942
I really am.

2295
01:52:20,821 --> 01:52:22,864
<i>I'm, like, trapped in here.</i>

2296
01:52:22,907 --> 01:52:24,406
Guess what.

2297
01:52:24,451 --> 01:52:26,451
It's me again.

2298
01:52:26,495 --> 01:52:28,027
<i>I don't know if you're away with Cath...</i>

2299
01:52:28,037 --> 01:52:29,329
<i>...are you away with Catherine?</i>

2300
01:52:29,371 --> 01:52:31,414
I mean, where are you guys, anyway?

2301
01:52:31,458 --> 01:52:33,415
Have you gone fishing?

2302
01:52:33,459 --> 01:52:35,368
It's just, like,
ever since she's been in your life,

2303
01:52:35,378 --> 01:52:37,419
I can't fucking reach you anymore.

2304
01:52:37,464 --> 01:52:39,214
I can't ever talk to you.

2305
01:52:39,257 --> 01:52:41,633
You're just, like, always fucking on some holiday!

2306
01:52:44,678 --> 01:52:47,013
Okay, ahem,
I just left you, like,

2307
01:52:47,057 --> 01:52:49,223
...a 20-minute message and I got cut off.

2308
01:52:49,267 --> 01:52:51,392
Andy, Marty,

2309
01:52:51,436 --> 01:52:53,219
I don't even know who I'm leaving messages for.

2310
01:52:53,229 --> 01:52:55,396
I'm just leaving messages now,
you know what I mean?

2311
01:52:58,485 --> 01:53:00,267
We're supposed to just sit
around and, like, you know,

2312
01:53:00,277 --> 01:53:02,736
...with our dicks in our hands,
doing nothing?

2313
01:53:02,781 --> 01:53:04,489
You know, I've been at this for two years.

2314
01:53:04,532 --> 01:53:06,824
Two years.
Two years!

2315
01:53:06,867 --> 01:53:09,660
<i>I can't keep going on this way!
I have to make a statement.</i>

2316
01:53:09,704 --> 01:53:12,330
I gotta make a
big statement!

2317
01:53:17,211 --> 01:53:19,629
<i>I can't go on like this.</i>

2318
01:54:13,892 --> 01:54:15,705
<i>We're not here. Leave a message.</i>

2319
01:54:17,104 --> 01:54:18,896
Mark, are you there?

2320
01:54:20,025 --> 01:54:22,482
Mark, pick up.

2321
01:54:32,245 --> 01:54:33,848
<i>Your call has been forwarded...</i>

2322
01:54:33,871 --> 01:54:36,039
<i>...to an automatic voice message system.</i>

2323
01:54:36,081 --> 01:54:38,499
<i>At the tone,
please record your message.</i>

2324
01:54:40,085 --> 01:54:41,544
Mark, I just
tried the house.

2325
01:54:41,588 --> 01:54:43,045
Uh... uh, call me.

2326
01:54:45,049 --> 01:54:47,008
<i>Come in.</i>

2327
01:54:47,052 --> 01:54:48,718
Mom.

2328
01:54:48,762 --> 01:54:50,135
<i>What's wrong?</i>

2329
01:54:50,179 --> 01:54:51,638
I just got these messages from Mark.

2330
01:54:51,681 --> 01:54:54,057
Uh, I tried calling the house,

2331
01:54:54,099 --> 01:54:56,224
...but he's...
he's not picking up.

2332
01:54:58,228 --> 01:55:01,272
All right, yeah, I just... I just pulled up.

2333
01:55:01,316 --> 01:55:02,940
I'm going inside.

2334
01:55:02,983 --> 01:55:05,067
I'll call you back.
All right.

2335
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:17,746
Mark?

2336
01:56:10,927 --> 01:56:12,593
Hey!

2337
01:56:12,637 --> 01:56:13,928
Hey, Nicky.

2338
01:56:13,972 --> 01:56:16,556
What are you doing, huh?

2339
01:56:16,598 --> 01:56:18,266
Wanna come with Papa?

2340
01:56:18,308 --> 01:56:20,892
We're gonna go outside.
You wanna go outs...

2341
01:56:25,775 --> 01:56:28,192
Okay, uh.
Grouper!

2342
01:56:28,236 --> 01:56:30,111
Gotta get your blanky.

2343
01:56:31,406 --> 01:56:33,114
<i>Grouper, come back.</i>

2344
01:56:33,157 --> 01:56:35,282
Hey, Nicky, with Papa
we're gonna play peek-a-boo.

2345
01:56:35,326 --> 01:56:38,745
Grouper, come! Grouper!

2346
01:56:38,787 --> 01:56:41,600
Grouper! Grouper, come!
Come on, that's a good boy.

2347
01:56:41,624 --> 01:56:43,708
That's a good boy.
Look at...

2348
01:56:43,751 --> 01:56:45,751
Grouper, good.

2349
01:56:45,794 --> 01:56:47,503
We're just gonna go outside.

2350
01:56:47,547 --> 01:56:48,629
<i>Hello?</i>

2351
01:56:48,673 --> 01:56:51,674
<i>It's Marty.</i>

2352
01:56:51,718 --> 01:56:53,217
<i>Mark's dead.</i>

2353
01:56:53,260 --> 01:56:55,010
<i>Stephanie!</i>

2354
01:56:55,053 --> 01:56:57,679
<i>- He... he hung himself.
- He's dead.</i>

2355
01:56:57,723 --> 01:57:00,223
<i>Has anybody called my mother?</i>

2356
01:57:00,267 --> 01:57:02,184
<i>I have to call my mother.</i>

2357
01:57:11,946 --> 01:57:14,489
Andy?

2358
01:57:14,531 --> 01:57:18,034
It's so good to hear your voice, sweetheart.

2359
01:57:46,104 --> 01:57:47,938
<i>I wrote Bernie a letter...</i>

2360
01:57:47,982 --> 01:57:51,442
<i>...a week
after Mark killed himself.</i>

2361
01:57:51,486 --> 01:57:53,318
<i>And I never sent it to him...</i>

2362
01:57:53,362 --> 01:57:55,278
<i>...because they monitor his mail...</i>

2363
01:57:55,322 --> 01:57:57,240
<i>...and I thought they would never, ever...</i>

2364
01:57:57,282 --> 01:57:59,534
<i>...give him a letter like this.</i>

2365
01:57:59,576 --> 01:58:01,194
<i>Well, here, you can say it on TV.
He's probably watching.</i>

2366
01:58:01,204 --> 01:58:03,870
Well, what I wrote to him was,

2367
01:58:03,915 --> 01:58:06,624
"Bernie,
while I will not..."

2368
01:58:06,668 --> 01:58:09,084
"...send you pictures of your grandchildren,"

2369
01:58:09,128 --> 01:58:12,879
<i>"...there is one picture I do want you to see."</i>

2370
01:58:12,924 --> 01:58:16,259
<i>"That last picture of your son Mark."</i>

2371
01:58:16,302 --> 01:58:18,844
"You owe it
to his widow,"

2372
01:58:18,888 --> 01:58:22,223
"...his children,
his brother, his mother."

2373
01:58:22,267 --> 01:58:26,352
<i>"So, here is what I wish for you, Bernie."</i>

2374
01:58:26,396 --> 01:58:28,854
<i>"Every time you sit down to eat,"</i>

2375
01:58:28,897 --> 01:58:32,232
<i>"...as you pick up your plastic fork,"</i>

2376
01:58:32,276 --> 01:58:35,443
<i>"I want you to see your son's corpse"</i>

2377
01:58:35,487 --> 01:58:39,031
<i>"...hanging from the rafter
directly over your table"</i>

2378
01:58:39,075 --> 01:58:42,159
<i>"...right on front of you, Bernie,"</i>

2379
01:58:42,202 --> 01:58:46,371
<i>"...so at every meal,
you see your son Mark..."</i>

2380
01:58:46,415 --> 01:58:48,915
<i>"...his white sweat socks
are swaying..."</i>

2381
01:58:48,959 --> 01:58:51,669
<i>"...ever so gently at your eye level..."</i>

2382
01:58:51,713 --> 01:58:54,839
<i>"...immediately above your food dish."</i>

2383
01:58:54,883 --> 01:58:57,049
"And as you look up, Bernie,"

2384
01:58:57,093 --> 01:58:59,384
"...you see..."

2385
01:58:59,428 --> 01:59:03,388
<i>"...you see your firstborn son hanging there,"</i>

2386
01:59:03,433 --> 01:59:06,767
<i>"...his head at a
left leaning angle..."</i>

2387
01:59:06,811 --> 01:59:08,894
<i>"...looking down at you,"</i>

2388
01:59:08,937 --> 01:59:11,772
<i>"...asking how could you do that to your son..."</i>

2389
01:59:11,816 --> 01:59:14,400
<i>"...who up until two years
before his death..."</i>

2390
01:59:14,443 --> 01:59:17,611
<i>"...had given you
the greatest gift..."</i>

2391
01:59:17,655 --> 01:59:21,240
<i>"...his unconditional love
for his father."</i>

2392
01:59:21,284 --> 01:59:23,576
<i>Well, I hope he heard that.</i>

2393
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:26,745
<i>- I hope he heard that.
- Well, he gets free television,</i>

2394
01:59:26,789 --> 01:59:28,371
<i>...so why shouldn't he hear it?</i>

2395
01:59:28,415 --> 01:59:30,833
<i>Why isn't he in a hole
where he belongs?</i>

2396
01:59:30,876 --> 01:59:32,751
<i>He says that he is happier in prison...</i>

2397
01:59:32,794 --> 01:59:34,461
- <i>...than he was before.
- Free meals!</i>

2398
01:59:34,504 --> 01:59:36,297
- <i>He feels safe in prison.
- His victims...</i>

2399
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:38,799
<i>...are eating their dinner
out of cat food cans.</i>

2400
01:59:38,843 --> 01:59:41,093
<i>Then he says, "The average person
thinks I robbed widows and orphans."</i>

2401
01:59:41,094 --> 01:59:43,888
<i>"I made wealthy people wealthier."
That is not true.</i>

2402
01:59:43,932 --> 01:59:46,014
<i>Mark... he wrote a note.</i>

2403
01:59:46,058 --> 01:59:47,516
<i>The note said,</i>

2404
01:59:47,559 --> 01:59:49,936
<i>"Bernie,
this is what happens..."</i>

2405
01:59:49,978 --> 01:59:52,271
<i>"...when you destroy your sons..."</i>

2406
01:59:52,315 --> 01:59:54,397
<i>- "...by your life of deceit."
- Mm-hmm.</i>

2407
01:59:54,442 --> 01:59:56,317
- <i>"Fuck you, Bernie."
- Mm-hmm.</i>

2408
01:59:56,361 --> 01:59:59,027
- <i>That was Mark's suicide note.
- Right.</i>

2409
02:00:04,701 --> 02:00:07,535
<i>I can't keep coming here.</i>

2410
02:00:09,665 --> 02:00:12,625
<i>I want a relationship with Andy...</i>

2411
02:00:12,669 --> 02:00:15,503
<i>...and he won't see me if I keep coming here.</i>

2412
02:00:15,545 --> 02:00:17,463
I can't have it both ways.

2413
02:00:17,507 --> 02:00:19,214
No, I understand.

2414
02:00:23,345 --> 02:00:26,304
And I can't talk to you anymore.

2415
02:00:26,348 --> 02:00:29,517
<i>You can't write to me or call me.</i>

2416
02:00:29,559 --> 02:00:31,434
<i>It'll be too hard.</i>

2417
02:00:31,478 --> 02:00:32,937
Ruth, all I want is what's best...

2418
02:00:32,981 --> 02:00:34,354
...for you and for the boys.

2419
02:00:34,398 --> 02:00:36,232
Boy, Bernie.

2420
02:00:37,901 --> 02:00:39,360
Boy.

2421
02:00:45,159 --> 02:00:47,576
You were my lifeguard.

2422
02:00:48,912 --> 02:00:52,248
I thought you were gonna protect me forever.

2423
02:00:53,918 --> 02:00:56,293
Best job I ever had.

2424
02:00:56,336 --> 02:00:58,586
I never had to save anybody.

2425
02:00:59,882 --> 02:01:01,882
I don't know if it will ever...

2426
02:01:01,925 --> 02:01:05,135
...be any different than it feels now.

2427
02:01:05,178 --> 02:01:08,638
I don't think after losing a child...

2428
02:01:08,683 --> 02:01:12,434
...things
ever get better.

2429
02:01:13,854 --> 02:01:16,563
I don't see much of a future for me.

2430
02:01:19,067 --> 02:01:22,402
And I don't really care if I have one.

2431
02:01:23,781 --> 02:01:25,447
The future's hard.

2432
02:01:27,535 --> 02:01:31,036
Yeah, I was sorry to see that
"People Magazine..."

2433
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:34,581
...used that photo of
you and Mark when he was a boy.

2434
02:01:36,376 --> 02:01:39,294
I can never forgive you, Bernie.

2435
02:01:41,257 --> 02:01:43,424
And yet I'm not angry at you.

2436
02:01:43,468 --> 02:01:45,259
I don't know why.

2437
02:01:46,763 --> 02:01:48,763
It's a combination of feeling numb...

2438
02:01:48,806 --> 02:01:51,264
...and it seeming fruitless.

2439
02:01:54,019 --> 02:01:56,562
I don't remember how much
I got paid as a lifeguard,

2440
02:01:56,606 --> 02:01:59,272
...but it was never about the money.

2441
02:02:05,197 --> 02:02:07,156
<i>In 2013,</i>

2442
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:10,159
<i>I invited Andrew to speak at a writing seminar</i>

2443
02:02:10,202 --> 02:02:12,035
<i>I conducted at Princeton...</i>

2444
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:15,498
<i>...under the general theme of
writing about con artists.</i>

2445
02:02:16,959 --> 02:02:19,375
<i>Andy had just started chemotherapy...</i>

2446
02:02:19,419 --> 02:02:22,254
<i>...for the reoccurrence of lymphoma.</i>

2447
02:02:22,298 --> 02:02:25,508
<i>The topic I asked him to
think about for the class...</i>

2448
02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:28,803
<i>...was how the media had
covered his father's case...</i>

2449
02:02:28,845 --> 02:02:31,013
<i>...and how that affected his life.</i>

2450
02:02:32,474 --> 02:02:33,973
<i>I've always wondered,</i>

2451
02:02:34,017 --> 02:02:36,184
...why didn't you go on TV and state your case?

2452
02:02:36,228 --> 02:02:37,727
Why didn't you defend yourself?

2453
02:02:37,772 --> 02:02:39,854
Well, one of the reasons

2454
02:02:39,898 --> 02:02:42,691
I've always felt
uncomfortable...

2455
02:02:42,735 --> 02:02:46,570
...about the prospect of
going on TV and telling my story...

2456
02:02:46,614 --> 02:02:49,365
...is that I don't know if I'm
that sympathetic a character.

2457
02:02:49,407 --> 02:02:51,951
<i>And at the end of the day,</i>

2458
02:02:51,994 --> 02:02:55,537
I lived a life of great
wealth and privilege.

2459
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:58,374
I traveled the world.

2460
02:02:58,416 --> 02:03:00,459
I wanted for nothing.

2461
02:03:00,503 --> 02:03:02,585
<i>All of that was subsidized...</i>

2462
02:03:02,629 --> 02:03:04,629
<i>...by my father's victims.</i>

2463
02:03:04,674 --> 02:03:09,468
It's hard to, um,
tell our story...

2464
02:03:09,512 --> 02:03:12,929
Mark's, my mother's, myself...

2465
02:03:12,973 --> 02:03:17,142
...when there are so many other stories.

2466
02:03:17,186 --> 02:03:19,436
<i>My brother killed himself.</i>

2467
02:03:19,479 --> 02:03:22,647
<i>My mother lost
the only man she ever loved,</i>

2468
02:03:22,692 --> 02:03:24,692
<i>...turned out to be a complete fraud.</i>

2469
02:03:24,735 --> 02:03:29,196
But, you know, there were just three of us.

2470
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:33,159
There are
thousands of victims.

2471
02:03:33,201 --> 02:03:35,201
And, uh...

2472
02:03:38,331 --> 02:03:40,165
Any other questions?

2473
02:03:40,209 --> 02:03:41,666
<i>Yes.</i>

2474
02:03:41,710 --> 02:03:43,419
<i>The father-son relationship...</i>

2475
02:03:43,461 --> 02:03:45,629
<i>...is such an important factor in anyone's life.</i>

2476
02:03:45,673 --> 02:03:48,124
<i>There must be some part of that
relationship with your father...</i>

2477
02:03:48,134 --> 02:03:49,633
<i>...that still exists.</i>

2478
02:03:49,677 --> 02:03:51,593
<i>Even after all this,</i>

2479
02:03:51,637 --> 02:03:53,628
<i>...can you see some point
where you could visit him...</i>

2480
02:03:53,638 --> 02:03:55,638
<i>...or talk to him again?</i>

2481
02:03:58,311 --> 02:04:00,393
My father is dead to me.

2482
02:04:04,525 --> 02:04:08,443
<i>On September 3rd, 2014,</i>

2483
02:04:08,486 --> 02:04:10,321
<i>...Andrew Madoff died...</i>

2484
02:04:10,364 --> 02:04:13,324
<i>...from mantle cell lymphoma.</i>

2485
02:04:33,553 --> 02:04:35,888
<i>Hi, this is Ruth.</i>

2486
02:04:35,932 --> 02:04:38,264
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

2487
02:04:40,352 --> 02:04:42,311
Hi, Ruth, I just wanted to...

2488
02:04:42,354 --> 02:04:46,773
I know I,
said I wouldn't call, but I just, um...

2489
02:04:46,817 --> 02:04:48,358
...um, okay.

2490
02:05:28,985 --> 02:05:31,192
<i>Hi, this is Ruth.</i>

2491
02:05:31,236 --> 02:05:33,361
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

2492
02:05:53,467 --> 02:05:55,425
<i>We're sorry.</i>

2493
02:05:55,468 --> 02:05:58,303
<i>You have reached a number
that is no longer in service.</i>

2494
02:05:58,347 --> 02:06:01,598
<i>If you feel that you have reached
this recording in error,</i>

2495
02:06:01,642 --> 02:06:03,392
<i>...please check the number and...</i>

2496
02:06:21,077 --> 02:06:23,202
<i>Hey, I was online today...</i>

2497
02:06:23,246 --> 02:06:25,246
<i>...and I'm reading some of
the old coverage of me...</i>

2498
02:06:25,249 --> 02:06:28,000
<i>...and I came across this article.</i>

2499
02:06:28,044 --> 02:06:30,376
Frankly, it was just ridiculous.

2500
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:32,504
What was the article?

2501
02:06:32,548 --> 02:06:35,465
The "New York Times" interviewed
this guy, a forensic psychologist...

2502
02:06:35,509 --> 02:06:37,509
...who worked on the Ted Bundy case.

2503
02:06:37,553 --> 02:06:39,053
And this guy, Joe Blow,

2504
02:06:39,079 --> 02:06:40,779
...whom I've never met,
never talked to...

2505
02:06:40,780 --> 02:06:43,420
...don't know from Adam, never
seen in my whole entire life...

2506
02:06:43,433 --> 02:06:45,217
...was going on and on
about the similarities...

2507
02:06:45,227 --> 02:06:47,436
...between Ted Bundy and myself.

2508
02:06:47,479 --> 02:06:51,982
Ah, I can see how that comparison
would be troubling, but...

2509
02:06:52,026 --> 02:06:53,400
Well, there is no comparison.

2510
02:06:53,443 --> 02:06:55,276
I mean, how can you compare me to someone...

2511
02:06:55,321 --> 02:06:57,780
...who decapitated women and
kept their heads as mementos?

2512
02:06:57,822 --> 02:07:00,991
I mean, that's the behavior of a
truly, truly evil human being.

2513
02:07:01,035 --> 02:07:06,537
I mean, what comparison is there,
ever, possibly in that?

2514
02:07:06,581 --> 02:07:08,540
And yet the "New York Times,"

2515
02:07:08,584 --> 02:07:09,875
...the newspaper of record,

2516
02:07:09,919 --> 02:07:11,919
...all the news that's fit to print...

2517
02:07:11,961 --> 02:07:14,879
...never had anyone say this is a
preposterous piece of writing,

2518
02:07:14,924 --> 02:07:16,484
...especially for the business section.

2519
02:07:16,509 --> 02:07:19,634
Well, why do you think they made that comparison?

2520
02:07:19,678 --> 02:07:22,845
- You know, when I turned myself in...
- Your sons turned you in.

2521
02:07:22,889 --> 02:07:24,473
No, no, but I turned myself in.

2522
02:07:24,517 --> 02:07:26,599
It was a matter of a few days,
so I was gonna do it.

2523
02:07:26,643 --> 02:07:28,768
So anyway, when I turned myself in...

2524
02:07:31,065 --> 02:07:33,265
...it was the height of the whole
anti-Wall Street hysteria...

2525
02:07:33,275 --> 02:07:35,016
...and they needed a villain,
they needed a face...

2526
02:07:35,026 --> 02:07:36,267
...for the whole mess they created.

2527
02:07:36,277 --> 02:07:39,362
That face became me,
so that's...

2528
02:07:39,406 --> 02:07:41,240
I don't know, I just...

2529
02:07:41,282 --> 02:07:43,575
I don't even wanna think about it.

2530
02:07:43,619 --> 02:07:45,619
Think about what?

2531
02:07:45,662 --> 02:07:47,579
Well, he killed people,
innocent people.

2532
02:07:47,623 --> 02:07:50,415
And in my case,
I told people, everyone,

2533
02:07:50,459 --> 02:07:52,118
"Don't put more than half your money with me."

2534
02:07:52,128 --> 02:07:53,626
"You never know.
Who the hell knows?"

2535
02:07:53,670 --> 02:07:55,545
"I mean, one day,
I could just go crazy."

2536
02:07:55,589 --> 02:07:57,964
But the reality is people are greedy.

2537
02:07:58,008 --> 02:08:02,260
Hmm, the reality is that
not even your warning was true...

2538
02:08:02,303 --> 02:08:05,304
<i>...and you took their money anyway.</i>

2539
02:08:12,897 --> 02:08:15,148
Let me ask you a question.

2540
02:08:16,818 --> 02:08:19,152
Do you think I'm a sociopath?
